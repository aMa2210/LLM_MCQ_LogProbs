"To solve this, I need to calculate the horizontal component of the force using trigonometry.

1. The horizontal component of a force is given by \( F_x = F \cdot \cos(\theta) \), where \( F \) is the magnitude of the force and \( \theta \) is the angle above the horizontal.
2. Here, \( F = 10 \, \text{N} \) and \( \theta = 45^\circ \). The cosine of \( 45^\circ \) is \( \cos(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 0.707 \).
3. Substituting the values, \( F_x = 10 \cdot 0.707 \approx 7 \, \text{N} \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to recall the principle of buoyancy, which states that a completely submerged object displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume.  
Next, I need to consider whether the object displaces its weight of fluid. This is true only if the object is floating, not when it is completely submerged.  
Finally, I need to evaluate whether the object displaces the density of the fluid. This is incorrect because density is a property of the fluid itself and is not displaced by the object.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to determine if the angle of incidence (20°) is less than or greater than the critical angle for the water-air interface. The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which total internal reflection occurs. 

Next, the critical angle can be calculated using Snell's law: \( \sin(\theta_c) = n_2 / n_1 \), where \( n_1 \) is the refractive index of water (approximately 1.33) and \( n_2 \) is the refractive index of air (approximately 1.00). Solving for \( \theta_c \), we find \( \theta_c = \arcsin(1.00 / 1.33) \approx 48.75° \).

Since the angle of incidence (20°) is less than the critical angle (48.75°), the light beam will pass into the air above the water.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the concept of four-dimensional geometry. In four-dimensional geometry, the rules of Euclidean geometry (like the sum of angles in a triangle being 180°) do not always apply.

Next, in non-Euclidean geometries, such as spherical or hyperbolic geometry, the sum of the angles of a triangle can be greater than or less than 180°, respectively. Four-dimensional geometry can involve such non-Euclidean spaces.

Finally, since the sum of the angles of a triangle in four-dimensional geometry depends on the specific geometry being used, the correct answer is that the angles of a triangle add to 180° only sometimes.

"To solve this, let's analyze the question step by step:

1. A voltage is induced in a wire loop due to electromagnetic induction, which is described by Faraday's Law of Induction. This law states that an electromotive force (EMF) is induced in a loop when there is a change in the magnetic flux through the loop.

2. Magnetic flux depends on the strength of the magnetic field, the area of the loop, and the angle between the magnetic field and the loop. A change in any of these factors will induce a voltage.

3. The other options (aligning with the electric field, being at right angles to the electric field, or converting to magnetic energy) do not directly cause an induced voltage according to Faraday's Law.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which color has the most energy per photon, I need to consider the relationship between energy and wavelength. The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength, meaning shorter wavelengths correspond to higher energy.

1. Red light has the longest wavelength among the options, so it has the least energy per photon.
2. Yellow-green light has a shorter wavelength than red but longer than blue and violet, so it has more energy than red but less than blue and violet.
3. Blue light has a shorter wavelength than yellow-green, so it has more energy per photon than yellow-green.
4. Violet light has the shortest wavelength among the options, so it has the most energy per photon.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze each choice in the context of general relativity.  
1. General relativity states that mass distorts spacetime, creating the effect we perceive as gravity. This makes choice a) correct.  
2. General relativity also predicts that gravity affects the passage of time, causing clocks in stronger gravitational fields to run slower. This makes choice b) correct.  
3. General relativity explains that the escape velocity of a black hole exceeds the speed of light, meaning light cannot escape from it. This makes choice c) correct.  
4. Since all three statements are true, the correct answer is d) All of these.  

{'sol': 'd'}"
"First, I need to understand the function of a step-up transformer. A step-up transformer increases the voltage of an electric circuit while decreasing the current, keeping the power (energy per unit time) constant.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. A step-up transformer does not increase energy; it only changes the voltage and current while maintaining the same energy transfer rate.

Therefore, the correct answer is that a step-up transformer can step up voltage but not energy.

{'sol': 'a'}"
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. Spectral lines are unique to each element and are produced when electrons transition between energy levels, emitting or absorbing specific wavelengths of light.
2. These lines are not random or chaotic; they are specific and predictable for each element, based on its atomic structure.
3. The spectral lines are not positioned by amplitude or in phase, as they are determined by the energy differences between electron levels, which correspond to specific wavelengths.
4. Therefore, the spectral lines are ordered and follow a specific pattern unique to each element.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this:

1. Understand the concept of a wave: A wave is a disturbance that transfers energy from one point to another without transferring matter.
2. Analyze the choices: Amplitude, wavelength, and frequency are properties of a wave, but they do not describe what the wave transfers.
3. Conclude: The correct answer is energy, as waves are known to transfer energy through a medium or space.

{'sol': 'd'}"
"First, I need to consider the forces acting on the charged particles. If the particles have the same sign of charge, they will repel each other, and the force between them will decrease as they move apart, leading to a decrease in acceleration. 

Next, if the particles have opposite charges, they will attract each other, and as they move closer, the force between them will increase, leading to an increase in acceleration.

Since the problem states that the acceleration of both particles increases, this indicates that the particles are attracting each other, which happens only when they have opposite charges.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider how energy is transferred from the Earth's surface to outer space. Conduction and convection require a medium (like air or water) to transfer energy, but outer space is a vacuum, so these methods are not applicable. 

Next, I consider radiation. Radiation is the transfer of energy through electromagnetic waves, which does not require a medium and can occur in a vacuum. This is how the Earth loses energy to outer space.

Finally, radioactivity refers to the decay of unstable atomic nuclei, which is not the primary mechanism for energy loss from the Earth's surface to space.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"In a series circuit, the current is the same through all components because there is only one path for the current to flow. 

Step 1: Understand that in a series circuit, the current does not split or change as it flows through each component. 
Step 2: If the current in one lamp is 2 A, the current in the lamp next to it must also be 2 A because the current is constant throughout the circuit.
Step 3: Therefore, the correct answer is that the current in the lamp next to it is 2 A.

{'sol': 'b'}"
"First, I need to consider the Doppler effect, which states that as a source of waves (in this case, light flashes) moves toward an observer, the frequency of the waves increases.  
Next, since the light source is approaching and gaining speed, the frequency of the flashes observed will increase due to the compression of the wavefronts.  
Finally, this means the correct answer is that the frequency of flashes will increase.  

{'sol': 'a'}"
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The ball is tossed upward, and we are told to neglect air resistance. This means the only force acting on the ball is its weight, which is due to gravity. The weight of the ball is given by \( F = mg \), where \( m \) is the mass of the ball and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity.

2. At any point during the ball's motion (whether going up, at the top, or coming down), the net force acting on the ball is still its weight, \( mg \), because there are no other forces acting on it (no air resistance or other external forces).

3. The position of the ball (whether at 10 m, 20 m, or any other height) does not change the net force acting on it. The net force remains constant and equal to \( mg \).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand why pumice floats in water. Objects float in water if their density is less than that of water. 

Next, pumice is known to have a lot of air pockets, which makes its overall density less than that of water.

Finally, since pumice floats, its density must be less than the density of water. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand that the color we see is the result of the light that is reflected by an object. A rose appears red because it reflects red light and absorbs other colors of light.  
Next, I consider the options. The rose does not reflect green light, so option b is incorrect. It also does not reflect a mixture of green and yellow, so option d is incorrect.  
Finally, white light contains all colors, and the rose absorbs all colors except red, which it reflects. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the Doppler effect, which explains how the frequency of a sound changes when the source of the sound is moving relative to the observer. 

Next, when the fire engine approaches, the sound waves are compressed, leading to an increase in frequency (higher pitch). 

The speed of sound in the medium (air) does not change due to the motion of the source, and the wavelength decreases as the frequency increases.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider what happens when you squeeze an air-filled balloon. Squeezing the balloon reduces the space the air occupies, which means the volume decreases. 

Next, the mass of the air inside the balloon does not change because no air is added or removed. Similarly, the weight remains constant because it depends on the mass and gravity.

Finally, as the volume decreases while the mass remains constant, the density (mass per unit volume) increases.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of polarization. Polarization is a property of waves that describes the orientation of their oscillations. 

Next, I note that polarization occurs only in transverse waves because their oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Longitudinal waves, on the other hand, oscillate parallel to the direction of propagation and cannot be polarized.

Finally, I conclude that polarization is a property of transverse waves only.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze the options. In a vacuum, there is no medium (like air or water) to exert a buoyant force on the object, so the object has no buoyant force. 

Next, mass is an intrinsic property of an object and does not depend on the environment, so the object still has mass in a vacuum.

Weight is the force due to gravity acting on an object. In a vacuum, gravity still exists, so the object has weight.

Finally, since the object has mass and weight, but no buoyant force, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to recall that temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.  
Next, I need to identify which type of kinetic energy is most directly related to temperature. Temperature is specifically proportional to the average translational kinetic energy of the particles, as this is the energy associated with their motion in space.  
Finally, I can conclude that the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the principles of a hydraulic press step by step:

1. A hydraulic press operates based on Pascal's principle, which states that pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted equally in all directions. This allows a small force applied to a small input piston to generate a larger force on a larger output piston.

2. However, the trade-off is that the output piston moves a shorter distance compared to the input piston. This is because the work (force × distance) must remain constant, assuming no energy losses.

3. The output piston can exceed the force input due to the difference in piston areas, but it cannot move farther than the input piston, as the input piston must displace more fluid to generate the larger force.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to recall the principle of conservation of angular momentum. In the absence of an external torque, the angular momentum of a system remains constant.

Next, angular momentum is given by the product of the moment of inertia and the angular velocity. When the system contracts, its moment of inertia decreases.

Finally, to conserve angular momentum, the angular velocity must increase as the moment of inertia decreases, but the angular momentum itself remains unchanged.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall Hooke's law, which states that the deformation (bend) of an elastic object is directly proportional to the force applied, as long as the elastic limit is not exceeded.

Next, if the weight is doubled, the force applied to the branch is also doubled.

Finally, since the deformation is directly proportional to the force, doubling the weight will result in twice the bend.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Kinetic Energy and Momentum Relationship**: Kinetic energy (KE) is given by \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), and momentum (p) is given by \( p = mv \). From these equations, we can express kinetic energy in terms of momentum as \( KE = \frac{p^2}{2m} \).

2. **Doubling Kinetic Energy**: If the kinetic energy doubles, then \( KE_{new} = 2 \cdot KE_{old} \). Substituting \( KE = \frac{p^2}{2m} \), we get \( \frac{p_{new}^2}{2m} = 2 \cdot \frac{p_{old}^2}{2m} \). Simplifying, \( p_{new}^2 = 2 \cdot p_{old}^2 \).

3. **Finding the New Momentum**: Taking the square root of both sides, \( p_{new} = \sqrt{2} \cdot p_{old} \). Since \( \sqrt{2} \) is approximately 1.41, the momentum increases but by less than double.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I know that the number of neutrons doubles every minute. If the reactor reaches one billion neutrons in 10 minutes, then one minute earlier, at 9 minutes, the number of neutrons would have been half of one billion, which is half a billion.  
Next, I confirm that the doubling process aligns with the timeline. Starting from half a billion at 9 minutes, doubling it in the next minute (10 minutes) indeed results in one billion.  
Therefore, the number of neutrons reached half a billion at 9 minutes.  

{'sol': 'd'}"
"First, I need to recall Newton's First Law of Motion, which states that an object in motion will remain in motion at a constant velocity (speed and direction) unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. 

Next, if the sum of all vector forces on the object is zero, this means there is no net force acting on the object. Therefore, the object will not accelerate or decelerate.

Finally, since the object is already moving, it will continue to move at a constant speed in a straight line because there is no force to change its state of motion.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. Relativity equations for time dilation, length contraction, and relativistic momentum are derived from Einstein's theory of special relativity. These equations are specifically designed to describe phenomena that occur at speeds close to the speed of light (relativistic speeds).

2. At everyday low speeds (much smaller than the speed of light), the effects of relativity are negligible, and classical mechanics (Newtonian physics) provides accurate results. Thus, relativity equations are not typically applied at low speeds.

3. Therefore, relativity equations hold true and are significant only at relativistic speeds, not at everyday low speeds.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the process of evaporation. Evaporation occurs when water molecules at the surface gain enough energy to escape into the air as vapor. This is likely to happen when a saucer of water is left on a table.

Next, I need to consider the process of condensation. Condensation occurs when water vapor in the air cools and turns back into liquid water. This is unlikely to happen on the saucer unless specific conditions, such as a very cold environment, are present.

Since evaporation is the primary process occurring in this scenario, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the density of water compared to mercury. Water is much less dense than mercury.  
Next, since the barometer relies on the weight of the liquid column to balance atmospheric pressure, a less dense liquid like water will require a taller column to exert the same pressure as mercury.  
Finally, this means a water-based barometer will be taller than a mercury-based barometer.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the concept of free fall. In free fall, the only force acting on an object is gravity, and air resistance is neglected. 

Next, I need to recall Newton's second law of motion, which states that acceleration is equal to the force acting on an object divided by its mass (a = F/m). For both rocks, the force due to gravity (weight) is proportional to their mass, so the ratio of force to mass is the same.

Finally, this explains why both rocks have the same acceleration in free fall, regardless of their mass. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Momentum and speed relationship**: Momentum \( p \) is given by \( p = mv \), where \( m \) is the mass and \( v \) is the velocity. If the momentum doubles, then \( 2p = m(2v) \). This means the speed of the body has doubled.

2. **Kinetic energy and speed relationship**: Kinetic energy \( KE \) is given by \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \). If the speed doubles, the new kinetic energy becomes \( KE' = \frac{1}{2}m(2v)^2 = \frac{1}{2}m(4v^2) = 4 \times \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = 4KE \). This shows that the kinetic energy becomes four times the original value, which is more than double.

3. **Conclusion**: Since the kinetic energy increases by a factor of 4 when the speed doubles, the correct answer is that the kinetic energy ""more than doubles.""

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the equation E = mc^2. This equation, formulated by Albert Einstein, states that energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared.

Next, I analyze the relationship between energy and mass. The equation shows that energy and mass are interchangeable and directly proportional, meaning they are closely related.

Finally, I evaluate the choices. The correct interpretation is that energy and mass are closely related, as described by the equation.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze the predictions of general relativity. General relativity predicts that light passing near a massive object like the Sun is deflected due to the curvature of spacetime caused by the Sun's gravity. This corresponds to option b.

Next, general relativity also predicts gravitational time dilation, where a clock closer to a massive object (like the Sun) runs slower compared to a clock farther away (like on Earth). This means option c is incorrect.

Finally, general relativity does not predict that light leaving the Sun is slowed by gravity; instead, it predicts a redshift in the light's wavelength. Therefore, option a is incorrect.

Since only option b is correct, the answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand what happens when an element ejects an alpha particle. An alpha particle consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which means it has a total mass of 4 and a charge of +2.

Next, when an element ejects an alpha particle, its atomic number decreases by 2 because it loses 2 protons. The atomic number determines the identity of the element.

Finally, the mass number of the element also decreases by 4 because it loses 2 protons and 2 neutrons, but the question specifically asks about the atomic number.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the behavior of a parallel circuit. In a parallel circuit, each lamp provides an additional path for the current to flow. 

Next, as more lamps are connected in parallel, the total resistance of the circuit decreases because the equivalent resistance in a parallel circuit is less than the resistance of the smallest individual resistor.

Finally, with a decrease in total resistance and assuming the voltage of the power source remains constant, the current in the power source increases according to Ohm's Law (I = V/R).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, I need to calculate the resultant groundspeed of the airplane using the Pythagorean theorem since the airspeed and crosswind are at right angles to each other.

1. The airspeed of the airplane is 40 km/h, and the crosswind is 30 km/h. These form the two perpendicular components of the velocity.
2. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the resultant groundspeed is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Groundspeed} = \sqrt{(\text{airspeed})^2 + (\text{crosswind})^2}
   \]
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \text{Groundspeed} = \sqrt{(40)^2 + (30)^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 900} = \sqrt{2500} = 50 \, \text{km/h}.
   \]
3. Therefore, the groundspeed of the airplane is 50 km/h.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall the relationship between the energy of a photon and its properties. The energy of a photon is given by the equation \( E = h \cdot f \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( f \) is the frequency of the photon.

Next, I analyze the options. Amplitude (a) and polarization (b) are not directly related to the energy of a photon. Momentum (c) is related to the photon's energy but not as directly as frequency (d), which is explicitly in the equation.

Finally, since the energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the process of thermal conduction step by step:

1. Thermal conduction is the transfer of heat through a material without the material itself moving. This occurs due to the movement of particles or energy within the material.
2. In metals, thermal conduction is primarily due to the movement of free electrons, which are highly mobile and can transfer energy efficiently.
3. In non-metals, thermal conduction occurs mainly through lattice vibrations, but the question is asking about the main contributors, which are electrons in most cases.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's think step by step:

1. The current in a circuit is the same throughout a series connection because current is the flow of charge, and charge is conserved. In this case, the LED lamp and the connecting wire are part of the same circuit.
2. Since the LED lamp and the connecting wire are in series, the current flowing through the LED lamp must be the same as the current flowing through the connecting wire.
3. Therefore, the current in the connecting wire is the same as the current in the LED lamp.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand what bow waves are. Bow waves are created when an object moves through a medium (like water) faster than the waves it produces can propagate outward.

Next, I analyze the options:
a) Overlapping one another: This is true because the waves produced by the object overlap as the object moves faster than the wave speed.
b) Constructively interfering: This is also true because the overlapping waves constructively interfere, creating a V-shaped wave pattern.
c) Moving slower than the source producing them: This is true because the object moves faster than the wave speed, causing the waves to lag behind and form the bow wave.

Finally, since all the options are correct, the answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. The speed of sound depends on the temperature of the air. As the temperature increases, the molecules in the air move faster, which allows sound waves to propagate more quickly.
2. On a hot day, the air temperature is higher, so the speed of sound is greater compared to a cold day.
3. On a cold day, the air temperature is lower, so the speed of sound is slower. A day with steady temperature does not necessarily indicate whether it is hot or cold, so it is not relevant to the comparison.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand how a mercury barometer works. The height of mercury in a barometer is determined by the atmospheric pressure and the density of mercury, not by the cross-sectional area of the tube.

Next, since atmospheric pressure is the same for both barometers and the density of mercury is constant, the height of mercury will be the same in both tubes regardless of their cross-sectional areas.

Finally, I conclude that the height of mercury in the narrower tube is the same as in the wider tube. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall the second law of thermodynamics, which states that heat naturally flows from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature unless external energy is applied.  
Next, I analyze the choices. Heat does not flow from cold to hot without external energy, as this would violate the second law of thermodynamics.  
Finally, I confirm that the correct answer aligns with the principle that heat requires external energy to flow from a colder to a hotter region.

"To solve this, I need to consider the relationship between the average speed of gas molecules and their molar mass. The average speed of gas molecules is inversely proportional to the square root of their molar mass, according to the equation derived from the kinetic theory of gases: \( v \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}} \), where \( M \) is the molar mass.

1. Hydrogen has the smallest molar mass (approximately 2 g/mol), followed by nitrogen (28 g/mol) and oxygen (32 g/mol). 
2. Since the average speed is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass, hydrogen molecules will have the greatest average speed because they have the smallest molar mass.
3. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to recall the principle of an ideal transformer. In an ideal transformer, there are no energy losses, meaning all the power input is transferred to the power output.

Next, since there are no losses in an ideal transformer, the power output must be equal to the power input.

Finally, based on this reasoning, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of terminal velocity. At terminal velocity, the force of air drag equals the weight of the object, and the object falls at a constant speed.

Next, the weight of the flying squirrel is given as 0.8 N. At terminal velocity, the air drag must balance this weight to prevent further acceleration.

Finally, since the air drag equals the weight at terminal velocity, the air drag on the squirrel is 0.8 N.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall the definition of a longitudinal wave. In a longitudinal wave, the particles of the medium vibrate in a direction parallel to the direction of wave propagation. 

Next, I need to analyze the options. The vibrations in a longitudinal wave are along and parallel to the wave's direction, which matches option a). 

Finally, I confirm that the vibrations are not perpendicular to the wave's direction, so option b) is incorrect. Options c) and d) are also incorrect because they do not describe the correct behavior of longitudinal waves.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. The potential energy of a compressed spring depends on the work done to compress or stretch the spring. This is based on Hooke's Law, where the work done on the spring is stored as elastic potential energy.

2. Similarly, the potential energy of a charged object depends on the work done to move the charge within an electric field. This work is stored as electric potential energy.

3. Since both forms of potential energy depend on the work done on the system, the correct answer is ""the work done on them.""

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the function of a step-up transformer. A step-up transformer increases the voltage of an electrical circuit while decreasing the current, keeping the power (energy per unit time) constant.

Next, I need to determine if it can step up energy. Energy is conserved in a transformer, so it cannot step up energy; it only changes the voltage and current.

Finally, based on this understanding, the correct answer is that a step-up transformer can only step up voltage.

"First, I need to recall the structure of an atom. An atom consists of a nucleus at its center, which contains protons and neutrons, and electrons orbiting around the nucleus.  
Next, neutrons are subatomic particles with no electric charge, and they are located within the nucleus along with protons.  
Finally, since neutrons are not found outside the nucleus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the phenomenon responsible for the greenish-blue color of ocean water. The color is primarily due to the absorption and scattering of light. Water absorbs colors in the red part of the light spectrum and reflects and scatters the blue part, which is why the ocean appears blue.

Next, I need to identify the correct term that explains the light that contributes to the greenish-blue color. The greenish-blue color is due to light that hasn’t been absorbed by the water, as the red wavelengths are absorbed more strongly.

Finally, I can conclude that the correct answer is the term that describes light that hasn’t been absorbed. 

{'sol': 'a'}"
"First, I need to understand how noise-canceling devices work. They use the principle of sound interference to cancel out unwanted noise. 

Next, noise-canceling devices produce sound waves that are the exact opposite (inverted phase) of the unwanted noise. When these two sound waves meet, they interfere with each other.

Finally, this interference results in the cancellation of the noise, which is known as destructive interference. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer:

1. Black is not the combination of all colors together. When all colors of light are combined, they produce white light, not black.
2. Black is not the result of combining two or more appropriate colors. Mixing pigments can create darker shades, but true black is the absence of light.
3. Black is not related to light when a prism is held upside down. A prism separates light into its spectrum of colors, and black is not a result of this process.
4. Black is the absence of light, so none of the given options accurately describe black.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's think step by step:

1. In a parallel circuit, the current through each branch is independent of the other branches. The total current in the circuit is the sum of the currents in each branch, but the current in one branch does not affect the current in another branch.

2. The current in a branch depends on the resistance of that branch and the voltage across it. Since the problem does not provide information about the resistance of the second lamp or the voltage of the circuit, we cannot determine the current in the second lamp.

3. Therefore, the correct answer is that there is not enough information to determine the current in the second lamp.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the phenomenon of refraction. When light passes from one medium to another, its speed changes due to the difference in optical densities of the two media.

Next, since the speed of light changes, the wavelength of light also changes because the frequency of light remains constant during refraction.

Finally, I conclude that both the speed and wavelength of light change when it refracts from one medium to another.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I need to calculate the beat frequency, which is the absolute difference between the frequencies of the two sound sources.

Step 1: The frequency of the first sound source is 500 Hz, and the frequency of the second sound source is 504 Hz.

Step 2: The beat frequency is calculated as the absolute difference between the two frequencies: |504 Hz - 500 Hz| = 4 Hz.

Step 3: Therefore, the beat frequency is 4 Hz.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall the relationship between sound properties and their physical characteristics. The loudness of a sound is determined by the energy of the sound wave, which is directly related to its amplitude. 

Next, I consider the other options: frequency, period, and wavelength. These are related to the pitch and speed of the sound, not its loudness.

Finally, since loudness is most closely related to amplitude, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's think step by step:

1. A Van de Graaff generator is a device that generates high voltages by transferring electric charge to a hollow metallic dome.
2. According to the principle of electrostatics, the electric field inside a conductor is zero when it is in electrostatic equilibrium. This applies to both charged and uncharged conductors.
3. The dome of the Van de Graaff generator is a conductor, so the electric field inside it will be zero regardless of whether it is charged or uncharged.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider the phenomenon of a sunrise or sunset. The redness is caused by the scattering of sunlight as it passes through the atmosphere. 

Next, I need to identify the process responsible for this. Shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (red and orange) due to Rayleigh scattering. This leaves the longer wavelengths, like red, more visible during sunrise and sunset.

Finally, the correct term for this process is ""scattered,"" as the light that remains visible is the result of scattering.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand what happens when uranium-238 emits an alpha particle. An alpha particle consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which means the atomic number decreases by 2 and the mass number decreases by 4.

Next, uranium-238 has an atomic number of 92. After emitting an alpha particle, the new element will have an atomic number of 92 - 2 = 90, which corresponds to thorium.

Finally, the mass number of uranium-238 decreases by 4, so the new mass number is 238 - 4 = 234. This means the resulting nucleus is thorium-234.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the Doppler effect step by step:

1. The Doppler effect refers to the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source.
2. When the source of sound moves toward the observer, the sound waves compress, leading to a higher frequency (or pitch).
3. When the source of sound moves away from the observer, the sound waves stretch, leading to a lower frequency (or pitch).
4. Therefore, the Doppler effect occurs in both cases: when the source moves toward or away from the observer.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider the effects of removing a proton from an atomic nucleus. A proton carries a positive charge, so removing it will decrease the atom's overall charge. 

Next, removing a proton also decreases the mass of the atom because protons contribute to the atomic mass.

Finally, the removal of a proton can also affect the energy of the atom, as it changes the nuclear binding energy and the overall stability of the nucleus.

Since all three—charge, energy, and mass—are affected, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to recall that the gravitational force between two objects is given by Newton's law of gravitation: \( F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \), where \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses of the two objects, \( r \) is the distance between them, and \( G \) is the gravitational constant.

Next, if the Sun's mass were doubled, \( m_1 \) in the formula would also double, while \( m_2 \) (Mars' mass) and \( r \) (the distance between the Sun and Mars) remain unchanged.

Finally, since the gravitational force is directly proportional to the product of the two masses, doubling the Sun's mass would result in the gravitational force also doubling.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. A sonic boom occurs when an aircraft travels faster than the speed of sound, creating shock waves due to the compression of air molecules. This phenomenon is associated with supersonic speeds.
2. Option a) ""breaking the sound barrier"" refers to the moment when the aircraft transitions from subsonic to supersonic speeds, which can produce a sonic boom.
3. Option b) ""pulling out of a subsonic dive"" does not involve supersonic speeds, so it would not produce a sonic boom.
4. Option c) ""flying faster than sound"" is correct because an aircraft traveling at supersonic speeds continuously generates shock waves, resulting in a sonic boom.
5. Option d) ""Each of these produces a sonic boom"" is incorrect because not all the scenarios listed (e.g., pulling out of a subsonic dive) produce a sonic boom.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the effects of gamma radiation on food. Gamma radiation is used to kill bacteria, parasites, and other pathogens in food, as well as to extend its shelf life. 

Next, I need to determine if gamma radiation makes food radioactive. Gamma radiation is a form of energy, not a particle, and it does not induce radioactivity in the food. 

Finally, I need to evaluate the other options. Gamma radiation does not make food spoil faster; in fact, it helps preserve it. There is no scientific evidence suggesting that irradiated food should be avoided if it is properly processed.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the phenomenon responsible for the red glow in a neon tube. Neon signs work by passing an electric current through a gas, which excites the gas atoms. 

Next, when the gas atoms return to their lower energy state (de-excitation), they emit light. The specific color of the light depends on the type of gas used. For neon, the emitted light is red.

Finally, the correct term for this process is ""de-excitation,"" as it describes the emission of light when excited atoms return to their ground state.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the behavior of light when it interacts with opaque materials. Opaque materials do not allow light to pass through them, meaning they do not transmit light.  
Next, the light that is not transmitted can either be reflected off the surface of the material or absorbed by the material. If absorbed, the light energy is converted into internal energy, such as heat.  
Finally, considering the options, the correct answer must account for both reflection and conversion to internal energy.  

{'sol': 'a'}"
"First, I need to recall that weight is determined by the gravitational force, which depends on the mass of the planet and the distance from its center. The formula for gravitational force is \( F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \), where \( r \) is the radius of the planet.

Next, since the planet's mass remains constant but its diameter shrinks to one-tenth, the radius also shrinks to one-tenth. The gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the radius, so if the radius becomes \( \frac{1}{10} \), the force (and thus the weight) increases by \( (10)^2 = 100 \).

Therefore, on the shrunken surface, you'd weigh 100 times as much. The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. The magnetic force on a charged particle, such as an electron, is given by the Lorentz force: **F = q(v × B)**, where q is the charge, v is the velocity of the particle, and B is the magnetic field. This force is always perpendicular to both the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field.

2. Since the magnetic force is perpendicular to the velocity, it does not do work on the particle. This means that the kinetic energy (and hence the speed) of the particle does not change. Therefore, the energy of the electrons remains constant.

3. However, the magnetic force can change the direction of the velocity of the electrons, causing them to move in a curved path (e.g., circular or helical motion). 

Thus, the magnetic force can change the direction of the electrons but not their energy.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the effect of microscopic slush (tiny ice particles) in water. Ice is less dense than liquid water because its molecular structure expands when it freezes. 

Next, when slush forms in water, it introduces these less dense ice particles into the liquid, which overall reduces the density of the water.

Finally, based on this reasoning, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the factors:

1. The speed of sound in air is primarily determined by the properties of the medium, such as air temperature, pressure, and density. Among these, air temperature has the most significant effect.
2. Frequency and wavelength are related to the speed of sound by the equation \( v = f \cdot \lambda \), where \( v \) is the speed, \( f \) is the frequency, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength. However, the speed of sound itself is not directly dependent on frequency or wavelength; instead, these two adjust to maintain the speed determined by the medium.
3. Therefore, the speed of sound in air depends on air temperature, not frequency or wavelength.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the process:

1. Heat transfer occurs in three main ways: conduction, convection, and radiation.
2. Conduction requires direct contact between materials, which is not possible in the vacuum of space between the Sun and Earth.
3. Convection involves the movement of fluids (liquids or gases), which also cannot occur in the vacuum of space.
4. Radiation, on the other hand, does not require a medium and can transfer energy through the vacuum of space. This is how heat from the Sun reaches Earth.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Torque is not just any force; it is a measure of the rotational effect of a force applied at a distance from a pivot point. So, option a) is incorrect.
2. Torque is calculated as the product of the force and the lever arm (the perpendicular distance from the pivot point to the line of action of the force). This makes option b) correct.
3. Torque is not a fictitious force; it is a real physical quantity that causes rotational motion. So, option c) is incorrect.
4. While torque can cause angular acceleration, it is not directly responsible for linear acceleration. So, option d) is not the best answer.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the nature of each option. Microwaves, light waves, and X-rays are all part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which includes a wide range of electromagnetic waves differing in wavelength and frequency.  
Next, I need to confirm if there is any wave listed that is not part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Upon review, all the options provided (microwaves, light waves, and X-rays) are indeed electromagnetic waves.  
Finally, since all the options are electromagnetic waves, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's think step by step:

1. A seesaw balances when the torques on both sides are equal. Torque is the product of force and the distance from the pivot point. This is the primary reason for balance on a seesaw.
2. While forces are involved (as they create torque), the balance is specifically due to the equality of torques, not just forces alone.
3. Energies are not directly related to the balance of a seesaw in this context.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand what happens when an atom emits an alpha particle or a beta particle. An alpha particle consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, so when an atom emits an alpha particle, its atomic number decreases by 2 and its mass number decreases by 4. This means the atom becomes an atom of a different element.

Next, when an atom emits a beta particle, a neutron in the nucleus is converted into a proton, and the atomic number increases by 1. This also results in the atom becoming an atom of a different element.

Finally, based on this understanding, the correct answer is that the atom always becomes an atom of a different element when it emits an alpha or beta particle.

{'sol': 'a'}"
"First, I need to understand what regelation is. Regelation is the process where ice melts under pressure and refreezes when the pressure is removed. This phenomenon occurs because of the unique properties of water.

Next, I need to identify which property of water is responsible for this. Regelation happens because ice has an open-structured crystal lattice, which makes it less dense than liquid water. When pressure is applied, the structure collapses, causing the ice to melt. When the pressure is removed, the ice refreezes.

Finally, I match this explanation to the choices provided. The correct choice is ""open-structured ice crystals.""

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the conservation of momentum. The momentum of the system (big fish + small fish) before and after the event must remain constant because no external forces are acting on the system.

Next, since the small fish is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. The big fish has an initial momentum based on its mass and speed. After swallowing the small fish, the combined mass of the big fish and small fish increases, but the total momentum remains the same.

Finally, because the total momentum is conserved and the mass of the big fish increases, the speed of the big fish must decrease to maintain the same momentum. Therefore, the big fish experiences a change in speed but not in momentum.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the function of a capacitor. A capacitor is an electronic component that stores electrical energy in an electric field. 

Next, I need to determine what it stores. A capacitor stores charge on its plates, and this stored charge creates an electric field, which in turn stores energy.

Finally, since a capacitor can store both charge and energy, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall the fundamental frequency relationship for a tube closed at one end and a tube open at both ends. For a tube closed at one end, the fundamental frequency corresponds to a wavelength that is four times the length of the tube (λ = 4L). For a tube open at both ends, the fundamental frequency corresponds to a wavelength that is twice the length of the tube (λ = 2L).

Next, I compare the lengths of the tubes for the same frequency. Since the wavelength for the closed tube is twice as long as that for the open tube, the length of the closed tube will be half the length of the open tube.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall the relationship between frequency and period. The period (T) of a wave is the reciprocal of its frequency (f), given by the formula T = 1/f.

Next, the frequency of the wave is given as 10 Hz. Substituting this value into the formula, T = 1/10 seconds.

Finally, simplifying this, T = 0.1 seconds, which corresponds to 1/10 seconds.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the gravitational effects of the Sun collapsing into a black hole. The mass of the Sun would remain the same, so the gravitational pull at Earth's distance would not change.

Next, since the gravitational pull remains the same, Earth's orbit would not be affected. The planet would continue to orbit the black hole just as it orbits the Sun now.

Finally, I can conclude that Earth would not be sucked into the black hole or pulled apart by tidal forces because the gravitational influence at Earth's distance remains unchanged.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The electric field between two oppositely charged parallel plates is uniform, meaning it has the same magnitude and direction at every point between the plates (ignoring edge effects). This is a key property of parallel plate capacitors.

2. Since the electric field is uniform, it does not get weaker with distance inside the plates. Therefore, option (a) is incorrect.

3. The inverse-square law applies to point charges, where the electric field strength decreases with the square of the distance from the charge. However, for parallel plates, the electric field is constant and does not follow the inverse-square law. Thus, option (b) is also incorrect.

4. Since neither (a) nor (b) is correct, the correct answer is (d) Neither of these.

Final answer: {'sol': 'd'}"
"First, I need to identify the principle that explains the flight of a blimp. A blimp floats in the air because it is filled with a gas (like helium) that is less dense than the surrounding air, allowing it to achieve buoyancy. 

Next, Archimedes' principle states that an object submerged in a fluid experiences an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. This principle applies to the blimp as it floats in the air, which is considered a fluid in this context.

Finally, I can conclude that the flight of a blimp is best explained by Archimedes' principle. 

{'sol': 'a'}"
"To solve this:

1. A plane mirror creates an image that appears to be the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of it.
2. This means the distance of the image behind the mirror is equal to the distance of the object in front of the mirror.
3. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's consider the following steps:

1. The discrete orbits of electrons in an atom are explained by quantum mechanics, which describes electrons as having wave-like properties.
2. The concept of discrete orbits arises from the idea that electrons can only occupy certain energy levels, which is consistent with the wave nature of electrons and the quantization of their energy.
3. Among the given choices, the best model to understand the discrete orbits of electrons is based on their wave-like behavior.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the question step by step:

1. Heat engines operate based on the principles of thermodynamics, specifically the second law of thermodynamics. The efficiency of a heat engine depends on the temperature difference between the heat source (high temperature) and the heat sink (low temperature).

2. According to the Carnot efficiency formula, the theoretical maximum efficiency of a heat engine is given by:  
   Efficiency = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot),  
   where T_cold is the temperature of the heat sink and T_hot is the temperature of the heat source. This shows that increasing the temperature of the heat source (T_hot) improves the efficiency of the engine.

3. Therefore, heat engines are more efficient when run at high temperatures, as this maximizes the temperature difference and improves efficiency.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of interference. Interference is a phenomenon where two or more waves superpose to form a resultant wave of greater, lower, or the same amplitude.

Next, I need to determine whether interference occurs for sound waves. Sound waves are mechanical waves, and they can interfere constructively or destructively when they meet.

Then, I need to determine whether interference occurs for light waves. Light waves are electromagnetic waves, and they also exhibit interference, as seen in experiments like the double-slit experiment.

Since interference occurs for both sound waves and light waves, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand how a series circuit works. In a series circuit, the total resistance increases as more lamps (or resistors) are added because the resistances add up.

Next, I know that the current in a circuit is determined by Ohm's Law: \( I = \frac{V}{R} \), where \( I \) is the current, \( V \) is the voltage, and \( R \) is the total resistance.

As more lamps are added in series, the total resistance \( R \) increases. Since the voltage \( V \) of the power source remains constant, the current \( I \) must decrease.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the nature of copper wire. Copper wire is a conductor, and it contains free electrons that allow it to conduct electricity. 

Next, I need to determine whether these free electrons are already present in the wire or if they need to be supplied externally. Free electrons are a property of the material itself, meaning they are already present in the copper wire.

Finally, I can conclude that the electrons are included in the wire and do not need to be supplied by the user.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the process of nuclear fission. When a uranium nucleus undergoes fission, it splits into two smaller nuclei (fission fragments) and releases energy. This energy is distributed among different forms.

Next, I consider the primary form of energy release. The majority of the energy released in fission is in the form of the kinetic energy of the fission fragments because the fragments are repelled by the strong nuclear forces and move apart at high speeds.

Finally, while some energy is also released as gamma radiation and the kinetic energy of ejected neutrons, these contributions are much smaller compared to the kinetic energy of the fission fragments.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the sources of radiation in Earth's biosphere. Natural background radiation includes radiation from natural sources such as radon gas, terrestrial sources, and cosmic rays. 

Next, I need to evaluate the other options. Radiation from military activities and nuclear power plants contributes to the total radiation, but these are much smaller contributors compared to natural background radiation.

Finally, cosmic rays are a part of natural background radiation, but they are not the majority source. The majority of radiation in Earth's biosphere comes from natural background radiation, including terrestrial and radon sources.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand that when white light passes through a prism, it undergoes dispersion, which separates the light into its constituent colors based on their wavelengths. 

Next, shorter wavelengths (like violet and blue) are bent more than longer wavelengths (like red and green) because they are refracted more strongly.

Finally, since green light has a longer wavelength than blue and violet light, it is bent less than those colors. However, it is bent more than red light, which has the longest wavelength.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. When the ball is at rest, the tension in the string is equal to the weight of the ball, which is \( T = mg \), where \( m \) is the mass of the ball and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity.

2. When the ball moves in a horizontal circle, the string forms an angle with the vertical, and the tension in the string has two components:
   - A vertical component (\( T \cos \theta \)) that balances the weight of the ball (\( mg \)).
   - A horizontal component (\( T \sin \theta \)) that provides the centripetal force required for circular motion (\( F_c = m v^2 / r \), where \( v \) is the speed of the ball and \( r \) is the radius of the circle).

3. Since \( T \cos \theta = mg \), the tension \( T \) must be greater than \( mg \) to account for both the vertical and horizontal components. Therefore, the tension in the string is always greater than \( mg \) when the ball is moving in a horizontal circle.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the forces acting on the tin can. When an object moves in a circular path, the net force responsible for this motion is the centripetal force. 

Next, the centripetal force always acts toward the center of the circle, as it is required to keep the object moving in a circular path.

Finally, since the net force acts inward toward the center of the circle, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the factors that influence ocean tides. Tides are primarily caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun on Earth's oceans. 

Next, the highest tides, known as spring tides, occur when the gravitational forces of the Moon and the Sun combine. This happens when the Earth, Moon, and Sun are aligned, either during a new moon or a full moon.

Finally, when the Earth and Moon are lined up with the Sun, their combined gravitational pull creates the highest ocean tides. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to determine the mechanical advantage (MA) of the pulley system. The mechanical advantage is the ratio of the load force (100 N) to the effort force (25 N). MA = 100 N ÷ 25 N = 4.

Next, I know that the mechanical advantage also tells us how the distance moved by the effort compares to the distance moved by the load. For every 1 meter of rope pulled down, the crate will rise by 1 ÷ MA = 1 ÷ 4 = 0.25 meters, or 25 cm.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's think step by step:

1. Specific heat capacity is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a substance by one degree Celsius. A material with a lower specific heat capacity heats up and cools down faster because it requires less energy to change its temperature.

2. The problem states that hot sand cools off faster at night than vegetation. This indicates that sand changes its temperature more quickly than vegetation.

3. Since sand cools off faster, it must have a lower specific heat capacity compared to vegetation, as it requires less energy to lose heat and change its temperature.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the solar radiation curve, which represents the intensity of sunlight at different wavelengths. The peak of this curve corresponds to the wavelength of light that is most intense.

Next, the Sun emits most of its energy in the visible spectrum, and the peak intensity of solar radiation occurs around the yellow-green part of the spectrum, which is approximately 500-550 nanometers.

Finally, this wavelength corresponds to the color yellow-green, which is why the human eye is most sensitive to this color.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider the principle of conservation of electric charge, which states that the current in a series circuit is the same at all points. 

Next, the filament of the lamp and the connecting wire are part of the same series circuit, so the current flowing through the filament must also flow through the connecting wire.

Finally, since there is no branching in the circuit, the current in the connecting wire will be equal to the current in the filament, which is 3 A.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to determine the atomic number and mass number of neon-20. Neon has an atomic number of 10 (10 protons) and a mass number of 20 (10 protons + 10 neutrons).

Next, if two protons and two neutrons are removed, the new nucleus will have 10 - 2 = 8 protons and 10 - 2 = 8 neutrons. This gives a new mass number of 8 + 8 = 16.

Finally, the element with 8 protons is oxygen, and the mass number is 16. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, gravitational waves travel at the speed of light, as predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity.  
Next, since the star is 20 light-years away, it would take gravitational waves exactly 20 years to reach Earth, just like light from the explosion.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which gas molecules are the fastest on average, we need to consider the relationship between the speed of gas molecules and their molar mass. According to the kinetic theory of gases, the average speed of gas molecules is inversely proportional to the square root of their molar mass at a given temperature.

Step 1: Identify the molar masses of the gases.
- Hydrogen (H₂) has a molar mass of approximately 2 g/mol.
- Oxygen (O₂) has a molar mass of approximately 32 g/mol.
- Nitrogen (N₂) has a molar mass of approximately 28 g/mol.

Step 2: Compare the molar masses.
Hydrogen has the smallest molar mass, followed by nitrogen, and then oxygen. Since the speed of gas molecules is inversely proportional to the square root of their molar mass, the gas with the smallest molar mass (hydrogen) will have the fastest molecules on average.

Step 3: Conclude the answer.
Hydrogen molecules are the fastest on average because they have the smallest molar mass.

"First, I need to understand the concept of mutual induction of electric and magnetic fields. This phenomenon is described by Maxwell's equations, which show that a changing electric field can produce a magnetic field, and a changing magnetic field can produce an electric field.

Next, I consider the result of this mutual induction. The continuous interaction of these fields can propagate through space as electromagnetic waves.

Finally, electromagnetic waves include light as a specific range of wavelengths. Additionally, these waves carry energy. Therefore, the mutual induction of electric and magnetic fields can produce both light and energy.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's consider the relationship between kinetic energy and speed:

1. The formula for kinetic energy is KE = 1/2 * m * v^2, where m is the mass and v is the velocity.
2. If the speed triples (v becomes 3v), the new kinetic energy becomes KE' = 1/2 * m * (3v)^2 = 1/2 * m * 9v^2 = 9 * (1/2 * m * v^2).
3. This means the new kinetic energy is 9 times the original kinetic energy.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the concept of nuclear fission. When a heavy nucleus like iron splits into smaller fragments, the binding energy per nucleon typically increases because smaller nuclei are generally more tightly bound than larger ones.

Next, I need to recall that the mass per nucleon is inversely related to the binding energy per nucleon. If the binding energy per nucleon increases, the mass per nucleon decreases due to the mass-energy equivalence principle.

Finally, since the fission fragments of an iron nucleus would have a higher binding energy per nucleon, they would consequently have less mass per nucleon compared to the original iron nucleus.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider how energy transfer occurs. Conduction and convection require a medium (like air or water) to transfer energy, but outer space is a vacuum, so these methods are not applicable.  
Next, radioactivity involves the emission of particles or radiation from unstable atomic nuclei, which is not the primary way Earth loses energy to space.  
Finally, radiation is the transfer of energy through electromagnetic waves, which can occur in a vacuum. This is how Earth loses energy to outer space, primarily in the form of infrared radiation.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of natural processes. Natural processes tend to follow the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy (disorder) of an isolated system will increase over time.

Next, I analyze the choices. Natural processes generally move from states of higher order (lower entropy) to states of lower order (higher entropy), as systems naturally progress toward greater disorder.

Finally, I conclude that the correct answer is the one that reflects this increase in disorder over time.

"To determine the principal source of the Earth's internal energy, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Tidal friction (a) contributes to some internal energy, but it is not the principal source. It mainly results from the gravitational interaction between the Earth, Moon, and Sun.

2. Gravitational pressure (b) played a role during the Earth's formation, compressing materials and generating heat. However, this is not the ongoing principal source of internal energy.

3. Radioactivity (c) is the primary source of the Earth's internal energy. The decay of radioactive isotopes like uranium, thorium, and potassium generates heat within the Earth's interior.

4. Solar radiation (d) is a significant source of energy for the Earth's surface and atmosphere but does not contribute to the Earth's internal energy.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the question step by step:

1. A diffraction grating is an optical device that splits light into its component wavelengths. This occurs due to the interaction of light waves with the closely spaced lines or slits on the grating.
2. The phenomenon responsible for this splitting is interference, where light waves overlap and either constructively or destructively interfere, creating patterns of bright and dark regions.
3. The other options (amplitudes, variations in brightness, and being composed of photons) do not directly explain the working principle of a diffraction grating.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the properties of Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere extends up to a certain altitude, but satellites in orbit are typically above most of the atmosphere, in what is called ""space.""

Next, I need to consider Earth's gravitational field. Satellites remain in orbit due to Earth's gravity, which means they are still within the gravitational field.

Finally, I evaluate the options. Satellites are above the atmosphere but within the gravitational field.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this:

1. Understand the terms: The ""time it takes for a pendulum swinging to and fro"" refers to the time it takes to complete one full cycle of motion.
2. The term that describes the time for one complete cycle is called the ""period.""
3. Other terms like frequency refer to the number of cycles per second, wavelength refers to the distance between wave crests, and amplitude refers to the maximum displacement.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall the concept of entropy. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. As entropy increases, the system becomes more disordered.

Next, I need to analyze the choices. If entropy increases, energy in the system becomes less ordered, as it moves toward a state of higher randomness or disorder.

Finally, I can conclude that the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's think step by step:

1. When water changes to steam, it undergoes a phase change from liquid to gas. This process is called vaporization.
2. During vaporization, energy is required to overcome the intermolecular forces holding the water molecules together in the liquid state. This energy is absorbed by the water.
3. The absorbed energy does not increase the temperature but is used to change the phase of the water from liquid to gas.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to recall Coulomb's law, which states that the force between two charged particles is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, \( F \propto \frac{1}{r^2} \), where \( r \) is the distance.

Next, if the distance between the particles is halved (placed twice as close), the new force will be proportional to \( \frac{1}{(r/2)^2} = \frac{1}{r^2/4} = 4 \times \frac{1}{r^2} \).

This means the force becomes four times as strong when the distance is halved.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the factors that increase the magnetic field strength of an electromagnet:

1. The magnetic field strength of an electromagnet depends on the electrical current passing through the coil. Increasing the electrical current will increase the magnetic field strength.

2. The material used as the core of the electromagnet also plays a significant role. A strong ferromagnetic material, such as iron, enhances the magnetic field strength compared to using an air core.

3. Other factors, such as the number of coils, can also affect the magnetic field strength, but the question specifically asks for factors that will increase the magnetic field strength.

Considering these points, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. In a tug-of-war, the tension in the rope is the same for both teams because the rope transmits the force equally in both directions. Therefore, producing more tension in the rope does not determine the winner. This eliminates option a.

2. The team that pushes harder against the ground generates a greater reaction force from the ground (Newton's third law). This reaction force allows the team to pull the rope more effectively and overcome the opposing team. Thus, pushing hardest on the ground is the key factor in winning. This supports option b.

3. Since option a is incorrect and option b is correct, option c (""Both"") is not valid.

4. Option d (""Neither"") is also incorrect because option b is valid.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the type of radiation that predominates inside high-flying commercial airplanes, let's analyze step by step:

1. Cosmic radiation consists of high-energy particles from outer space, including protons, alpha particles, and other nuclei. When these particles interact with Earth's atmosphere, they produce secondary radiation, including neutrons, muons, and gamma rays.

2. At high altitudes, such as those where commercial airplanes fly, the atmosphere is thinner, so there is less shielding from cosmic radiation. Among the secondary radiation produced, gamma rays are highly penetrating and can reach the interior of the airplane.

3. Alpha and beta particles are less penetrating and are typically stopped by the airplane's structure or even the atmosphere itself. Gamma radiation, being highly penetrating, is the predominant type of radiation experienced inside the airplane.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Thermal convection is the transfer of heat through the movement of a fluid (liquid or gas) caused by temperature differences. This eliminates ""a) radiant energy"" because radiant energy involves electromagnetic waves, not fluid movement.

2. Convection specifically occurs in fluids (liquids and gases), as they can flow and transfer heat through bulk movement. This makes ""b) fluids"" a strong candidate.

3. Insulators are materials that resist the flow of heat and electricity. Since convection requires the movement of heat through fluids, insulators are not directly involved in the process. This eliminates ""c) insulators.""

4. ""d) All of these"" cannot be correct because radiant energy and insulators are not central to the process of thermal convection.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to use Ohm's Law, which states that \( V = I \times R \), where \( V \) is the voltage, \( I \) is the current, and \( R \) is the resistance.

Next, I substitute the given values into the formula. The current \( I = 10 \, \text{A} \) and the resistance \( R = 10 \, \Omega \). So, \( V = 10 \times 10 = 100 \, \text{V} \).

Finally, I compare the calculated voltage (100 V) with the given choices. None of the choices match the correct value of 100 V, so there seems to be an issue with the options provided."
"First, I need to consider the horizontal and vertical components of the motion separately. The horizontal velocity remains constant at 10 m/s because there is no horizontal acceleration.

Next, I calculate the vertical velocity after one second. The vertical velocity is determined by the acceleration due to gravity, which is approximately 9.8 m/s². After one second, the vertical velocity is 9.8 m/s.

Now, I find the resultant speed by combining the horizontal and vertical components using the Pythagorean theorem:  
Resultant speed = √(horizontal velocity² + vertical velocity²) = √(10² + 9.8²) ≈ √(100 + 96.04) ≈ √196.04 ≈ 14 m/s.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to calculate the average speed using the formula: speed = distance ÷ time.  
The distance traveled by the gazelle is 2 km, and the time taken is one-half hour (0.5 hours).  
Next, dividing the distance by the time: 2 km ÷ 0.5 hours = 4 km/h.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the principle behind the operation of metal detectors. Metal detectors work by generating a magnetic field and detecting changes in this field caused by the presence of metal objects.

Next, I consider the laws provided in the choices. Ohm's law relates to electrical resistance, Coulomb's law deals with electric forces between charges, and Newton's laws pertain to motion and forces. Faraday's law, however, describes how a changing magnetic field can induce an electric current, which is the principle used in metal detectors.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the mediums through which sound can travel. Sound is a mechanical wave, and it requires a medium to propagate. 

Next, I know that sound can travel through solids, liquids, and gases because these mediums have particles that can vibrate and transfer the sound energy.

Finally, since sound can travel through all three states of matter, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. In a fusion reaction involving hydrogen isotopes (e.g., deuterium and tritium), the reaction produces an alpha particle (helium nucleus) and a neutron. The energy released in the reaction is distributed among the products.

2. The neutron, being much lighter than the alpha particle, typically carries away most of the kinetic energy due to conservation of momentum and energy. The alpha particle, being heavier, moves more slowly and thus has less kinetic energy.

3. Gamma radiation is not a significant component of the energy released in this specific fusion reaction. The energy is primarily in the form of kinetic energy of the reaction products.

4. Therefore, most of the energy is carried away as the kinetic energy of the neutron.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. Polarization refers to the orientation of oscillations in a wave. It is a property that can only occur in waves where the oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.
2. Transverse waves, such as light waves, have oscillations perpendicular to the direction of propagation, and thus they can be polarized.
3. Longitudinal waves, such as sound waves, have oscillations parallel to the direction of propagation, and they cannot be polarized.
4. Therefore, polarization is a property of transverse waves only.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the phenomenon of beats. Beats occur when two sound waves of slightly different frequencies interfere with each other, creating a periodic variation in amplitude.

Next, I analyze the choices. Reflection refers to the bouncing back of sound waves, refraction refers to the bending of sound waves, and interference refers to the combination of sound waves.

Since beats are specifically caused by the interference of sound waves, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of absolute zero. Absolute zero is the theoretical temperature at which all molecular motion ceases. It is defined as 0 kelvin on the Kelvin scale. 

Next, I need to consider the Celsius scale. Absolute zero corresponds to −273.15°C on the Celsius scale, which is often approximated as −273°C.

Finally, since both 0 kelvin and −273°C represent the same temperature (absolute zero), the correct answer is both.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall the concept of refraction. Refraction occurs when a wave passes from one medium to another, causing a change in its speed due to the difference in the properties of the two media.

Next, I consider the effects of this change in speed. When the speed of the wave changes, its direction also changes unless it crosses the boundary perpendicularly. However, the frequency of the wave remains constant during refraction.

Finally, I evaluate the choices. The correct answer must involve both speed and direction, as these are the properties that change during refraction.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the context of the question. When you tap a piece of wood, it vibrates and produces a sound. The sound produced is related to the physical properties of the wood, such as its size, shape, and material composition.

Next, I need to identify which of the given choices is most directly related to the sound produced. The natural frequency of an object is the frequency at which it vibrates when disturbed, and this is determined by the object's physical properties. The sound produced by the wood is directly related to its natural frequency.

Finally, I confirm that the other options (wavelength, amplitude, and period) are not as directly related to the characteristic sound of the wood as its natural frequency.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to recall Bernoulli's principle, which states that an increase in the speed of a fluid (in this case, air) occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure.  
Next, as the wind speeds up over the top of a hill, the velocity of the air increases. According to Bernoulli's principle, this increase in velocity leads to a decrease in atmospheric pressure.  
Finally, I can conclude that the atmospheric pressure decreases when wind speeds up over the top of a hill.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall that when white light passes through a prism, it undergoes dispersion, separating into its constituent colors based on their wavelengths. 

Next, shorter wavelengths bend more than longer wavelengths. Green light has a medium wavelength, so colors with shorter wavelengths than green will bend more.

Blue light has a shorter wavelength than green, so it bends more than green.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's consider the concept of time dilation from Einstein's theory of relativity:

1. According to the theory of relativity, when you travel at high speeds (close to the speed of light), time slows down for you relative to someone who is stationary. This phenomenon is called time dilation.
2. Your friends who ""stay at home"" are stationary and experience time normally, while you, traveling at high speed, experience time more slowly.
3. As a result, when you return, you will have aged less than your friends who stayed at home. This means you are younger compared to them.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the motion of a tossed baseball step by step:

1. When a baseball is tossed, it follows a parabolic trajectory due to the influence of gravity. The motion can be broken into two components: horizontal and vertical.
2. The horizontal component of velocity remains constant because there is no horizontal force acting on the baseball (assuming air resistance is negligible). This means the horizontal velocity does not change during the motion.
3. The vertical component of velocity, however, changes due to the force of gravity. Gravity causes the vertical velocity to decrease as the baseball rises, become zero at the peak, and then increase in the downward direction as the baseball falls.

Thus, the component of velocity that can remain constant is the horizontal component.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to identify the correct characteristic of crystals in minerals. Crystals are solid materials whose atoms are arranged in a highly ordered, repeating pattern.

Next, I evaluate the choices:
a) Atoms with a definite geometrical arrangement - This matches the definition of crystals, as their atoms are arranged in a specific, repeating pattern.
b) Molecules that perpetually move - This does not describe crystals, as their structure is fixed and not in perpetual motion.
c) X-ray patterns - While X-ray diffraction is used to study crystals, it is not what crystals are composed of.
d) 3-dimensional chessboards - This is not a scientific description of crystals.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, I need to consider the possible resultant magnitudes when two vectors are combined. 

1. The maximum resultant occurs when the two vectors are aligned in the same direction. In this case, the resultant is the sum of their magnitudes: 3 N + 4 N = 7 N.
2. The minimum resultant occurs when the two vectors are aligned in opposite directions. In this case, the resultant is the difference of their magnitudes: 4 N - 3 N = 1 N.
3. For any other angle between the vectors, the resultant will lie between the minimum (1 N) and maximum (7 N) values. 

Thus, the resultant cannot be 0 N, cannot be 8 N, and cannot be any value outside the range of 1 N to 7 N. Therefore, the correct answer is not ""Any of these.""

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the nature of radioactivity. Radioactivity is a natural phenomenon that occurs due to the decay of unstable atomic nuclei, and it has existed as long as the elements themselves have existed.  
Next, the Earth formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, and radioactive elements like uranium and thorium have been present since that time.  
Finally, this means that radioactivity has been around since the Earth formed, not just during human history or technological advancements.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, casting a shadow on the Moon. This is not the situation described in the question.
2. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon comes between the Sun and the Earth, casting a shadow on the Earth. This matches the situation described in the question.
3. The option ""solar eclipse if it’s daytime and lunar eclipse if it’s nighttime"" is incorrect because the type of eclipse does not depend on the time of day but rather on the alignment of celestial bodies.
4. While a solar eclipse can be dangerous to view without proper protection, it is not inherently a ""very dangerous event"" as described in option d.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the relationship between mass and energy in nuclear reactions. According to Einstein's equation \(E=mc^2\), energy and mass are related, and a small amount of mass can be converted into a large amount of energy.

Next, in both fission and fusion, a small amount of mass is converted into energy, which means the total mass of the products is slightly less than the mass of the reactants.

Finally, this decrease in mass corresponds to the energy released during the reaction. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the process of condensation. When molecules condense from the air, they release latent heat into the surrounding environment. 

Next, this release of heat increases the thermal energy of the surrounding air, causing the temperature of the remaining air to rise.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall the formula for density, which is density = mass/volume. 

Next, if the volume of the object doubles and the mass remains the same, the denominator in the formula (volume) increases while the numerator (mass) stays constant.

Finally, this means the density will be halved because the same mass is now spread over twice the volume.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, I will consider the formula for pressure at the bottom of a liquid column, which is given by \( P = \rho g h \), where:

1. \( \rho \) is the density of the liquid (water density in this case).
2. \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity.
3. \( h \) is the depth of the liquid column.

Step 1: From the formula, it is clear that the pressure depends on \( \rho \), \( g \), and \( h \). This means the pressure is influenced by the water density, the acceleration due to gravity, and the depth of the pond.

Step 2: The surface area of the pond does not appear in the formula. This indicates that the pressure at the bottom of the pond is independent of the surface area.

Step 3: Therefore, the correct answer is the factor that does not affect the pressure, which is the surface area of the pond.

{'sol': 'd'}"
"First, I need to consider why the sky appears blue during the daytime. This phenomenon is primarily due to the way sunlight interacts with Earth's atmosphere. 

Next, sunlight is made up of different colors, and when it passes through the atmosphere, shorter wavelengths (like blue) are scattered in all directions by the gases and particles in the air.

Finally, this scattering of shorter wavelengths (blue light) is what makes the sky appear blue to our eyes. This process is called Rayleigh scattering, and it is not due to absorption, transmission, or reflection.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this:

1. A galvanometer is an instrument used to detect and measure small electric currents. By default, it measures current.
2. However, a galvanometer can be modified or calibrated with additional components (like a series resistor or shunt) to measure voltage as well.
3. Therefore, a galvanometer can be calibrated to read either current or voltage.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, when two bodies of water at different temperatures are mixed, the resulting temperature will be somewhere between the two initial temperatures, depending on their masses and specific heat capacities. 

Next, since the temperatures of the two water samples are 20°C and 28°C, the resulting temperature must lie between these two values.

Finally, options 19°C and higher than 30°C are outside this range, so they can be eliminated. The most likely temperature is closer to the middle of the range, such as 22°C.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the geometry of the situation. The mirror reflects light, and the image of your face is formed by light rays traveling from your face to the mirror and then to your eyes.

Next, the minimum height of the patch to wipe away depends on the fact that the mirror only needs to reflect half the height of your face for you to see the full image. This is because the light rays from the top and bottom of your face travel symmetrically to the mirror and then to your eyes.

Finally, the distance from the mirror does not affect the minimum height of the patch, as the geometry of reflection remains the same regardless of distance.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall the definition of a transverse wave. In a transverse wave, the vibrations or oscillations of the particles of the medium are perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. 

Next, I analyze the options. The vibrations do not move along the wave, so option a) is incorrect. The vibrations move perpendicular to the wave, so option b) is correct. Options c) and d) are also incorrect because they do not align with the definition of a transverse wave.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the concept of beats**: The beat frequency is the absolute difference between the frequencies of two sound sources. In this case, the beat frequency is given as 3 beats per second.

2. **Set up the relationship**: The frequency of the piano string could either be higher or lower than the tuning fork's frequency. Therefore, the piano string's frequency could be either \( 1134 + 3 = 1137 \, \text{Hz} \) or \( 1134 - 3 = 1131 \, \text{Hz} \).

3. **Determine if more information is needed**: Since the problem does not specify whether the piano string's frequency is higher or lower than the tuning fork's frequency, we cannot definitively determine the exact frequency of the piano string.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to recall what Huygens' principle states. Huygens' principle describes how every point on a wavefront acts as a source of secondary spherical wavelets, and the new wavefront is the envelope of these wavelets.

Next, I need to determine which of the options aligns with this description. Since Huygens' principle is about the propagation of light as a wave, it is primarily associated with waves.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the properties of materials when heated. Most materials, including iron, expand when their temperature increases due to the increase in the kinetic energy of their particles.

Next, this expansion typically occurs in all dimensions, but the question specifically asks about the length of the strip. As the temperature increases, the length of the strip will increase.

Finally, I can conclude that the correct answer is that the length of the strip increases when the temperature is increased.

{'sol': 'a'}"
"First, I need to consider the phenomenon of interference. Interference occurs when two or more waves overlap, and their amplitudes combine.

Next, in constructive interference, the amplitudes of the waves add up, potentially building up to more than the sum of individual amplitudes.

In destructive interference, the amplitudes can cancel each other out completely if they are equal and opposite.

Therefore, both scenarios are possible under interference. The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the question step by step:

1. Televisions use the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color model to create colors. Yellow is not a primary color in this model but is created by combining specific primary colors.
2. In the RGB model, yellow is produced by combining red and green light. When red and green phosphors are activated simultaneously, the human eye perceives the color yellow.
3. Blue is not involved in creating yellow in the RGB model.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify the nature of electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves are waves that consist of oscillating electric and magnetic fields and do not require a medium to travel. Examples include light, radio waves, and X-rays.

Next, I need to analyze the given options. Light, radio waves, and X-rays are all part of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, sound is a mechanical wave that requires a medium (like air, water, or solids) to propagate and is not part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Understand the system**: The two books are tied together with a string. One book falls vertically due to gravity, while the other is dragged horizontally across the table. Since there is no friction, the only force acting on the system is gravity on the falling book.

2. **Apply Newton's second law**: Let the mass of each book be \( m \). The falling book experiences a gravitational force \( F = mg \), which accelerates the entire system. The total mass of the system is \( 2m \) (both books combined).

3. **Calculate the acceleration**: The net force on the system is \( mg \), and the total mass is \( 2m \). Using \( F = ma \), the acceleration \( a \) of the system is:
   \[
   a = \frac{F}{\text{total mass}} = \frac{mg}{2m} = \frac{g}{2}.
   \]

Thus, the acceleration of the books is \( g/2 \).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the functions of a motor and a generator. A motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy, while a generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.  
Next, I need to determine if they are similar or different. Both devices involve energy conversion but in opposite directions, so they are similar in principle but not identical in function.  
Finally, I evaluate the options. They are not forms of transformers or energy sources, so the best answer is that they are similar devices.  

{'sol': 'a'}"
"First, I need to consider the behavior of a parallel circuit. In a parallel circuit, each lamp provides an additional path for current to flow, effectively reducing the total resistance of the circuit. 

Next, as the total resistance decreases, Ohm's Law (V = IR) tells us that for a constant voltage source, the current (I) will increase as resistance (R) decreases.

Finally, since more lamps in parallel reduce the total resistance, the current in the power source will increase.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Newton's law of cooling describes the rate at which an object changes temperature through heat exchange with its surroundings. 

Step 1: The law applies to situations where the temperature of an object is different from its surroundings, and the object is either cooling down or warming up to reach thermal equilibrium.

Step 2: Cooling occurs when the object is hotter than its surroundings, and warming up occurs when the object is cooler than its surroundings.

Step 3: Therefore, Newton's law of cooling applies to both cooling and warming processes.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider the phenomenon described. The Moon always shows the same face to Earth because it is tidally locked, meaning its rotation period matches its orbital period around Earth.  
Next, I need to determine how long it takes for the Moon to complete one orbit around Earth. This period is approximately one month.  
Finally, since the Moon's rotation period matches its orbital period, the Moon rotates about its axis once per month.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the forces acting on the ball step by step:

1. The ball is rolling in a horizontal circular path inside the cone. The forces acting on the ball are:
   - The gravitational force \( mg \), acting vertically downward.
   - The normal force \( N \), exerted by the cone's surface, which acts perpendicular to the surface of the cone.
   - The centripetal force required for circular motion, which is provided by the horizontal component of the normal force.

2. The normal force \( N \) has two components:
   - A vertical component \( N \cos\theta \), which balances the gravitational force \( mg \).
   - A horizontal component \( N \sin\theta \), which provides the centripetal force for the circular motion.

3. Since \( N \cos\theta = mg \), the normal force \( N \) is related to \( mg \) by \( N = \frac{mg}{\cos\theta} \). Depending on the angle \( \theta \) of the cone, \( \cos\theta \) can vary, and thus \( N \) can be greater than \( mg \). It is never less than \( mg \) because \( \cos\theta \leq 1 \).

Therefore, the normal force \( N \) is always greater than \( mg \). The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the nature of sound waves. Sound waves are longitudinal waves, meaning the particles of the medium vibrate parallel to the direction of wave propagation.

Next, compressions are regions of high pressure where particles are close together, and rarefactions are regions of low pressure where particles are spread apart. These regions move along the same direction as the wave propagates.

Therefore, the compressions and rarefactions in sound travel in the same direction as the wave.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to calculate the work done to raise the crate. The work done is equal to the gravitational potential energy gained, which is given by the formula: Work = m * g * h, where m is the mass (100 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²), and h is the height (2 m). So, Work = 100 * 9.8 * 2 = 1960 J.

Next, I need to calculate the power required. Power is the rate at which work is done, given by the formula: Power = Work / Time. The time is 4 seconds, so Power = 1960 J / 4 s = 490 W.

Finally, I compare the calculated power to the given choices. The closest option is 500 W.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the phenomenon of beats. Beats occur when two sound waves of slightly different frequencies interfere with each other. 

Next, I consider the options. Destruction (a) is not correct because beats are not about destroying sound. Resonance (c) is not correct because resonance involves the amplification of sound at a specific frequency. Amplification (d) is not correct because beats are not about increasing the volume of sound.

Finally, interference (b) is correct because beats are caused by the constructive and destructive interference of two sound waves.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand what interference is. Interference occurs when two or more waves overlap, resulting in a new wave pattern. This phenomenon is common to all types of waves.

Next, I need to evaluate each option:
- Sound waves can interfere, producing constructive or destructive interference, such as in beats.
- Light waves can interfere, as seen in phenomena like the double-slit experiment.
- Water waves can interfere, creating patterns of constructive and destructive interference on the surface of water.

Since interference is a property of all these types of waves, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Kinetic energy**: In both fission and fusion, there is a release of energy, often in the form of kinetic energy. Therefore, kinetic energy does not remain unchanged.

2. **Mass**: In both fission and fusion, some mass is converted into energy (as per Einstein's equation \(E=mc^2\)). Thus, mass does not remain unchanged.

3. **Number of nucleons**: In both fission and fusion, the total number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) is conserved. This is a fundamental principle of nuclear reactions.

4. **Binding of nucleons**: The binding energy of nucleons changes in both fission and fusion, as energy is released due to changes in nuclear binding.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall the nature of the magnetic force. The magnetic force on a charged particle is always perpendicular to the velocity of the particle. 

Next, since the force is perpendicular, it cannot do work on the particle, meaning it cannot change the particle's speed (kinetic energy remains constant).

However, the perpendicular force can change the direction of the particle's motion, causing it to move in a curved path.

Therefore, the magnetic force can change the direction of the particle but not its speed. The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the effects of traveling at a speed close to the speed of light according to Einstein's theory of relativity. 

1. According to relativity, as an object approaches the speed of light, its relativistic mass increases. This means the object would require more and more energy to continue accelerating as it gets closer to the speed of light.
2. The pulse or biological processes of the traveler would not decrease in their own frame of reference because time dilation affects how time is observed by an external observer, not the traveler themselves.
3. Therefore, only the mass change is relevant in this context.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to recall the relationship between electricity and magnetism. They are interconnected phenomena described by Maxwell's equations.

"First, I need to understand how sound travels in air. Sound is a mechanical wave that propagates through a medium by causing particles in the medium to oscillate back and forth. 

Next, in air, sound waves are longitudinal waves, meaning the oscillations of air particles occur in the same direction as the wave's propagation. This creates regions of high pressure (compressions) and low pressure (rarefactions).

Finally, since sound waves consist of both compressions and rarefactions as they travel through air, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider Newton's Third Law of Motion, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means the cannonball and the cannon exert equal and opposite forces on each other.

Next, I need to consider the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration, given by Newton's Second Law of Motion: \( F = ma \). Since the cannon and cannonball have different masses, their accelerations will not be equal even though the forces are equal.

Therefore, the cannonball and the cannon experience equal amounts of force, but not equal accelerations. The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to recall that an electrically neutral atom has an equal number of protons and electrons.  
Next, since the nucleus of the iron atom contains 26 protons, the number of electrons in this neutral atom must also be 26.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the behavior of light and color. A rose petal appears red because it reflects red light while absorbing other colors of light.  
Next, I need to identify the correct choice that matches this explanation.  
The correct choice is ""reflects red,"" as the petal reflects red light to our eyes.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I will use the formula for comparing sound intensities in decibels: 

1. The decibel scale is logarithmic, and the formula for the difference in intensity is: \( \text{Difference in decibels} = 10 \cdot \log_{10}(\text{Intensity Ratio}) \).
2. The difference between 80 decibels and 60 decibels is \( 80 - 60 = 20 \) decibels.
3. Rearranging the formula, the intensity ratio is \( 10^{\frac{\text{Difference in decibels}}{10}} = 10^{\frac{20}{10}} = 10^2 = 100 \).

Thus, a sound of 80 decibels has an intensity 100 times greater than a sound of 60 decibels.

"First, I need to recall the primary colors of light and their combinations. The primary colors of light are red, green, and blue. When two primary colors of light are combined, they produce secondary colors.

Next, I consider the combination of red and blue light. When red and blue light are overlapped, they produce magenta, which is a secondary color of light.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to calculate the efficiency of the device using the formula: Efficiency = (Useful Work Output / Total Energy Input) × 100%.

Next, the useful work output is 40 J, and the total energy input is 100 J. Substituting these values into the formula: Efficiency = (40 J / 100 J) × 100% = 40%.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of shock waves. Shock waves are produced when an object moves faster than the speed of sound in a medium, causing sound waves to overlap and create a sudden change in pressure.

Next, I analyze the choices:
a) Overlapping one another: This is correct because shock waves are formed when sound waves overlap due to the source moving faster than the speed of sound.
b) Constructively interfering: This is also correct because the overlapping sound waves constructively interfere, leading to the formation of a shock wave.
c) Moving slower than the source producing them: This is incorrect because shock waves occur when the source moves faster than the speed of sound, not slower.
d) All of these: This is incorrect because not all the statements are true.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate the buoyant force step by step:

1. The weight of the rock out of water is 5 N. This represents the actual weight of the rock.
2. When the rock is submerged in water, it weighs 3 N. This is the apparent weight of the rock in water.
3. The buoyant force is the difference between the actual weight and the apparent weight. So, the buoyant force is 5 N - 3 N = 2 N.

Since 2 N is not listed as an option, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to calculate the work done on the crate. Work is given by the formula \( W = F \cdot d \), where \( F \) is the force applied and \( d \) is the distance moved in the direction of the force.

1. The force applied to lift the crate is equal to its weight, which is \( F = m \cdot g \), where \( m = 100 \, \text{kg} \) and \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). So, \( F = 100 \cdot 9.8 = 980 \, \text{N} \).

2. The distance the crate is lifted is \( d = 2 \, \text{m} \).

3. The work done is \( W = F \cdot d = 980 \cdot 2 = 1960 \, \text{J} \), which is approximately \( 2000 \, \text{J} \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's think step by step:

1. The capacitor loses half its remaining charge every second. This means the charge decreases exponentially, halving at each second.
2. After 1 second, the charge is reduced to \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the initial charge. After 2 seconds, it is reduced to \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the initial charge, and so on.
3. After 5 seconds, the charge is \( q \). This means the initial charge \( Q \) is related to \( q \) by the equation:
   \[
   Q \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5 = q
   \]
4. Simplify \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5 \), which equals \( \frac{1}{32} \). So:
   \[
   Q \times \frac{1}{32} = q
   \]
5. Solve for \( Q \):
   \[
   Q = 32q
   \]

Thus, the initial charge was 32q. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the structure of an atom. The mass of an atom is primarily concentrated in its nucleus, which contains protons and neutrons (collectively called nucleons). Electrons have negligible mass compared to nucleons.

Next, I need to consider the volume of an atom. The volume of an atom is determined by the space occupied by its electron cloud, as electrons are distributed in orbitals around the nucleus.

Therefore, the mass of an atom comes mostly from its nucleons, and its volume comes mostly from its electrons.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of magnetic inclination. Magnetic inclination is the angle made by the Earth's magnetic field lines with respect to the horizontal plane at a given location.

Next, I analyze the choices:
a) Magnetic north and geographic north refer to the difference in direction, which is not related to inclination.
b) Magnetic north and geographic south are unrelated to the concept of inclination.
c) The Earth's magnetic field at any point and the vertical would describe a different angle, not inclination.
d) The Earth's magnetic field at any point and the horizontal correctly describes the angle of magnetic inclination.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the relationship between the pitch of a sound and its properties. Pitch is the perception of how high or low a sound is. 

Next, I consider the options:
- Intensity refers to the loudness of the sound, which is not directly related to pitch.
- Frequency refers to the number of vibrations per second, and higher frequencies are perceived as higher pitch.
- Amplitude refers to the size of the sound wave, which affects loudness, not pitch.
- Speed refers to how fast the sound travels, which does not determine pitch.

Finally, since pitch is directly related to the frequency of the sound wave, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the behavior of a series circuit. In a series circuit, the total resistance increases as more lamps (or resistors) are added because the resistances add up.

Next, as the total resistance increases, the current in the circuit decreases because current is inversely proportional to resistance (Ohm's Law: I = V/R, where V is constant).

Finally, since the current in the power source is the same as the current in the circuit, the current in the power source also decreases as more lamps are connected.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand what happens when an element ejects an alpha particle. An alpha particle consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which means it has a mass number of 4.

Next, when an element ejects an alpha particle, its mass number decreases by the mass of the alpha particle, which is 4.

Finally, the correct answer is that the mass number of the resulting element reduces by 4.

{'sol': 'b'}"
"First, I need to consider the effects of an electric field on an electron. An electric field exerts a force on a charged particle like an electron, causing it to accelerate and increase its speed.

Next, I need to consider the effects of a magnetic field on an electron. A magnetic field exerts a force on a moving charged particle, but this force is perpendicular to the direction of motion. Therefore, a magnetic field changes the direction of the electron's motion but does not increase its speed.

Finally, since only an electric field can speed up an electron, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the changes step by step:

1. **Alpha particle emission**: When an element emits an alpha particle, it loses 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This decreases the atomic number by 2.

2. **First beta particle emission**: A beta particle emission converts a neutron into a proton, increasing the atomic number by 1.

3. **Second beta particle emission**: Another beta particle emission converts another neutron into a proton, increasing the atomic number by 1 again.

Now, let's calculate the net change in the atomic number:
- The alpha particle emission decreases the atomic number by 2.
- The two beta particle emissions increase the atomic number by 1 each, for a total increase of 2.

Thus, the net change in the atomic number is: -2 (from alpha) + 2 (from beta) = 0.

The atomic number of the resulting element is unchanged.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the phenomenon described. When an object vibrates due to a wave with a matching frequency, it is a specific type of vibration.

Next, I recognize that this phenomenon is called resonance, where the natural frequency of the object matches the frequency of the wave, leading to an increase in amplitude.

Finally, I confirm that resonance is the correct term for this occurrence.

{'sol': 'b'}"
"First, I need to understand the phenomenon responsible for the red glow in a neon tube. Neon signs work by passing an electric current through a gas, which excites the gas atoms. 

Next, when the excited neon atoms return to their lower energy state, they release energy in the form of light. This process is called de-excitation, and the specific color of the light (red, in this case) depends on the gas used.

Finally, I can conclude that the red glow in a neon tube is due to the de-excitation of neon atoms. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's consider the concept of length contraction in special relativity:

1. According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, when an object moves at very high speeds (close to the speed of light) relative to an observer, its length appears contracted in the direction of its motion. This phenomenon is known as length contraction.
2. The contraction only occurs in the direction of travel, while the dimensions perpendicular to the direction of travel remain unchanged.
3. Therefore, the object appears shorter in the direction of travel to the observer at rest.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to recall the relationship between wave speed, frequency, and wavelength. The wave speed is given by the product of frequency and wavelength: \( v = f \lambda \). 

Next, when a wave moves from shallow water to deep water, the speed of the wave increases because the wave speed depends on the depth of the water. However, the frequency of the wave does not change because it is determined by the source of the wave.

Finally, since the speed increases and the frequency remains constant, the wavelength must also increase to maintain the relationship \( v = f \lambda \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the acceleration due to gravity, which is always 9.8 m/s² near the Earth's surface, regardless of whether the object is dropped or thrown downward.  
Next, I need to recognize that the initial velocity of the ball (whether zero or nonzero) does not affect the acceleration due to gravity, as gravity is constant.  
Finally, since there is no air resistance, the acceleration of the ball immediately after leaving the hand will still be 9.8 m/s².  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to identify the primary source of Carbon-14 production. Carbon-14 is formed when cosmic rays interact with nitrogen atoms in the Earth's atmosphere.  
Next, cosmic radiation causes a reaction where a neutron collides with a nitrogen-14 atom, converting it into carbon-14.  
Finally, this process occurs naturally in the atmosphere, not in food, Earth's interior, or as a result of nuclear bomb tests.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand what causes chain reactions in a fission reactor. In a fission reaction, a heavy nucleus splits into smaller nuclei, releasing energy and neutrons. 

Next, these ejected neutrons can collide with other fissile nuclei, causing them to undergo fission as well, which releases more neutrons and energy. This process continues, creating a chain reaction.

Finally, the correct answer is the factor directly responsible for sustaining the chain reaction, which is the ejected neutrons.

"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. Satellites in circular orbit are under the influence of Earth's gravitational force, which acts as the centripetal force. This force keeps the satellite in its circular path and is not zero or negligible.
2. The gravitational force acts perpendicular to the satellite's velocity (towards the center of the Earth), meaning there is no component of force along the direction of the satellite's motion. This is why the satellite maintains a constant speed.
3. The gravitational force is weaker at the satellite's altitude compared to Earth's surface, but this does not directly explain why the speed remains constant.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to recall that complementary colors are pairs of colors that, when combined, cancel each other out (produce white or black). In the RGB color model, complementary colors are opposite on the color wheel.

Next, blue is one of the primary colors in the RGB model. Its complementary color is the color formed by combining the other two primary colors, red and green.

Combining red and green produces yellow, which is the complementary color of blue.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the characteristics of direct current (dc) and alternating current (ac). In dc, the electric charges flow steadily in one direction, meaning there is no change in the direction of flow over time. 

Next, I need to evaluate the options:
a) ""Steadily in one direction"" accurately describes dc.
b) ""In one direction"" is partially correct but does not emphasize the steady flow.
c) ""To and fro"" describes ac, not dc.
d) ""All of these"" cannot be correct because not all options apply to dc.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) ""current in one direction"" is not necessarily a requirement for receiving an electric shock. Alternating current (AC) can also cause electric shocks, so this is not correct.

2. Option b) ""presence of moisture"" can increase the likelihood of an electric shock by lowering body resistance, but it is not a strict requirement for an electric shock to occur. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.

3. Option c) ""high voltage and low body resistance"" can increase the severity of an electric shock, but an electric shock can still occur at lower voltages if there is sufficient current flow. Thus, this is not the best answer.

4. Option d) ""voltage difference across part or all of your body"" is the correct answer because an electric shock occurs when there is a voltage difference that causes current to flow through the body.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will use Newton's Third Law of Motion, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

1. The karate chop delivers a force of 3000 N to the board. According to Newton's Third Law, the board must exert an equal and opposite force on the hand.
2. This means the force exerted by the board on the hand is equal in magnitude to the force applied by the hand to the board.
3. Therefore, the force that the board exerts on the hand is 3000 N.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this:

1. The speed of a wave is calculated using the formula: speed = frequency × wavelength.
2. The period is the reciprocal of the frequency, so it is not used to calculate the speed.
3. Amplitude refers to the height of the wave and does not affect the speed of the wave.
4. Therefore, the correct answer is wavelength.

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Gravitational force and orbit shape**: The gravitational force depends on the distance between the satellite and the center of the Earth. If the orbit is circular, the distance remains constant, so the gravitational force is constant. 

2. **Elliptical orbit**: In an elliptical orbit, the distance between the satellite and the Earth changes as the satellite moves along its path. This means the gravitational force will vary depending on the satellite's position in the orbit.

3. **Parabolic orbit**: A parabolic orbit is not a closed orbit, and the distance between the satellite and the Earth changes continuously. Thus, the gravitational force is not constant in this case either.

4. **Conclusion**: The gravitational force is constant only in a circular orbit.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. The impulse-momentum relationship states that the change in momentum of an object is equal to the impulse applied to it. Mathematically, this is expressed as \( F \cdot \Delta t = \Delta p \), where \( F \) is the force, \( \Delta t \) is the time interval, and \( \Delta p \) is the change in momentum.

2. This relationship is derived from Newton's second law of motion, which states that \( F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} \). Rearranging this equation gives \( F \cdot \Delta t = \Delta p \), which is the impulse-momentum relationship.

3. Newton's first law describes inertia, Newton's third law describes action-reaction pairs, and the law of gravity pertains to gravitational forces, none of which directly lead to the impulse-momentum relationship.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Next, I need to determine how this heat is used. The heat produced in the reactor is typically used to convert water into steam, which then drives turbines to generate electricity.

Finally, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) ""heats water"" aligns with the process of using the heat from fission to produce steam. Option b) ""generates electricity directly"" is incorrect because the reactor generates heat, not electricity directly. Option c) ""gets energy from nothing"" is incorrect because the energy comes from nuclear fission. Option d) ""is a major polluter of the atmosphere"" is also incorrect because nuclear reactors do not emit greenhouse gases during operation.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's think step by step:

1. Boiling water involves heating it until it reaches its boiling point, which is typically 100°C (212°F) at standard atmospheric pressure.
2. Once the water reaches its boiling point, any additional heat energy goes into converting the water from liquid to vapor (steam) rather than increasing its temperature further.
3. Therefore, the process of boiling water warms the water until it reaches its boiling point, but it does not cool the water.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand how scaling an object affects its surface area and volume. When an object is scaled up by a factor of 3 in its linear dimensions, the surface area increases by the square of the scaling factor, and the volume increases by the cube of the scaling factor.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction, which states that a changing magnetic field in a closed loop induces an electromotive force (EMF), which is essentially a voltage. 

Next, this induced voltage can drive a current in the loop if the circuit is closed. 

Finally, the changing magnetic field also creates an electric field in the loop. 

Since all of these phenomena occur, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the concept of time dilation from Einstein's theory of relativity. Time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer.

Next, I need to determine the perspective from which the clocks on the spaceship appear to run slow. According to relativity, the clocks on the spaceship will appear to run slow when viewed from an observer on Earth because the spaceship is moving relative to Earth.

Finally, from the perspective of someone inside the spaceship, the clocks on the spaceship would appear normal because they are in the same frame of reference as the observer.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall what the photoelectric effect demonstrates. The photoelectric effect shows that light can eject electrons from a metal surface when it has sufficient energy.

Next, I need to consider which model of light explains this phenomenon. The wave model of light cannot explain why only light above a certain frequency can eject electrons, regardless of its intensity. However, the particle model of light, which describes light as photons with quantized energy, explains this behavior.

Finally, since the particle model of light is supported by the photoelectric effect, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The string is producing four loops (antinodes). Each loop corresponds to half a wavelength. Therefore, the total length of the string (12.00 m) is equal to 4 half-wavelengths, or 2 full wavelengths.

2. To find the wavelength, divide the total length of the string by the number of full wavelengths. Since there are 2 full wavelengths in 12.00 m, the wavelength is 12.00 m ÷ 2 = 6.00 m.

3. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. A sonic boom occurs when an aircraft travels faster than the speed of sound, creating shock waves due to the compression of air. This means the aircraft is flying faster than sound, which corresponds to option c.

2. Breaking the sound barrier is the act of transitioning from subsonic (below the speed of sound) to supersonic (faster than the speed of sound). During this transition, a sonic boom is produced. This corresponds to option a.

3. Pulling out of a subsonic dive does not necessarily involve breaking the sound barrier or producing a sonic boom. Therefore, option b is not correct.

4. Since both a and c are correct, the answer cannot be ""All of these"" (option d), as b is not correct.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the principal source of Earth's internal energy, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Tidal friction (a) contributes to Earth's energy but is not the primary source. It results from gravitational interactions with the Moon and Sun, causing minor heating effects.

2. Gravitational pressure (b) played a role during Earth's formation, compressing materials and generating heat. However, this is not the ongoing primary source of internal energy.

3. Radioactivity (c) is the decay of radioactive isotopes (like uranium, thorium, and potassium) within Earth's interior. This process releases significant heat and is considered the main contributor to Earth's internal energy.

4. Geothermal heat (d) refers to the heat present within the Earth, but it is not a source itself. Instead, it is a result of processes like radioactivity and residual heat from Earth's formation.

Next, I consider the fact that at everyday low speeds, relativistic effects are negligible, and classical mechanics (Newtonian physics) provides accurate results. Therefore, relativistic equations are not necessary at low speeds.

Then, I note that relativistic equations are exact and hold true at all speeds, but their effects become significant only at speeds near the speed of light. At low speeds, they reduce to classical equations.

Option b) refers to common sense, which is not a scientific principle in this context. Option c) states the laws are the same in all frames of reference, but this is too broad since it does not specify uniform motion. Option d) correctly specifies that the laws of physics are the same in all uniformly moving frames of reference.

2. A calorie is a unit of heat energy, often used in chemistry and biology, and is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius.
3. A joule is the SI unit of energy, including heat energy, and is widely used in physics and engineering. It is related to calories by the conversion factor: 1 calorie = 4.184 joules.
4. Since both calories and joules can be used to measure heat, the correct answer is ""Either.""

"First, I need to consider the Doppler effect, which explains how the frequency of a sound changes when the source of the sound is moving relative to the observer. 

Next, when the fire engine approaches, the sound waves are compressed, leading to an increase in frequency (higher pitch). However, the speed of sound in the medium (air) remains constant and is not affected by the motion of the source.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. When light reflects off a smooth surface, its speed remains constant because the medium does not change. The frequency of light is determined by the source and does not change during reflection.
2. The wavelength of light is related to its speed and frequency. Since neither the speed nor the frequency changes during reflection, the wavelength also remains unchanged.
3. Therefore, there is no change in frequency, wavelength, or any other property of light during reflection.

"First, I need to recall Einstein's theory of relativity, which fundamentally changed our understanding of space and time.  
Second, Einstein discovered that space and time are not separate entities but are interconnected and form a single continuum called spacetime.  
Third, this discovery means that space and time are parts of one whole, not independent of each other.  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

"To solve this, let's think step by step:

1. Rotational inertia (also called the moment of inertia) depends on both the mass of the object and how that mass is distributed relative to the axis of rotation.
2. The farther the mass is from the axis of rotation, the greater the rotational inertia. This is because rotational inertia is proportional to the square of the distance from the axis (I = Σmr²).
3. Therefore, when most of the mass is located away from the axis, the rotational inertia is maximized.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the concept of surface area. When small pieces of material are assembled into a larger piece, the surface area of the individual pieces that are in contact with each other is no longer exposed. 

Next, this means that the combined surface area of the larger piece will be less than the total surface area of the individual pieces before assembly.

Finally, the correct answer is that the combined surface area decreases when small pieces are assembled into a larger piece.

"To solve this, I need to consider the process of how a rainbow is formed:

1. When light enters a raindrop, it undergoes **refraction**, bending as it moves from air into the denser water.
2. Inside the raindrop, the light undergoes **dispersion**, where it splits into its constituent colors because different wavelengths of light refract by different amounts.
3. The light also undergoes **internal reflection** within the raindrop, bouncing off the inside surface.
4. Finally, the light exits the raindrop, refracting again and forming the rainbow.

Since all three processes (refraction, dispersion, and internal reflection) are involved in forming a rainbow, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the nature of electrical forces in the atomic nucleus. Electrical forces are due to the interaction between charged particles, such as protons, which are positively charged.

Next, I know that like charges repel each other. Since protons in the nucleus are all positively charged, the electrical forces between them will cause repulsion.

Finally, this repulsion means that electrical forces in the nucleus tend to push particles apart, opposing the strong nuclear force that holds the nucleus together.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. Newton's first law deals with the concept of inertia and states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force. This does not directly explain why the acceleration of free fall is the same for all masses.

2. Newton's second law states that the force acting on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration (F = ma). When considering free fall, the force is the gravitational force (F = mg), and combining this with F = ma gives a = g, showing that the acceleration due to gravity (g) is independent of the mass of the object. This explains why all objects fall with the same acceleration in the absence of air resistance.

3. Newton's third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This law does not directly explain the uniform acceleration of free fall.

4. The law of action-reaction is another way of describing Newton's third law, so it also does not explain the phenomenon.

Thus, the correct explanation is provided by Newton's second law.

"First, I need to understand the difference between solar radiation and terrestrial radiation. Solar radiation primarily consists of shorter wavelengths, such as visible light and ultraviolet, while terrestrial radiation consists of longer wavelengths, such as infrared.

Next, since wavelength and frequency are inversely related (as wavelength increases, frequency decreases), terrestrial radiation, having longer wavelengths, will have lower frequencies compared to solar radiation.

Finally, this means terrestrial radiation has both a lower frequency and a longer wavelength compared to solar radiation.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall the concept of time dilation from Einstein's theory of relativity. Time dilation refers to the phenomenon where time appears to pass at different rates for observers in different frames of reference, particularly when one is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Next, I consider the relationship between time and speed. According to relativity, as an object approaches the speed of light, time for that object stretches or slows down relative to an observer at rest.

Finally, I evaluate the choices. The correct answer is the one that states time stretches with speed, as this aligns with the concept of time dilation.

"To solve this, let's think step by step:

1. A current-carrying wire generates a magnetic field around it due to the movement of electric charges.
2. According to Ampere's law and the right-hand rule, the magnetic field lines around a straight current-carrying wire form concentric circles around the wire.
3. This is a fundamental property of magnetic fields generated by currents.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's think step by step:

1. The buoyant force acting on an object submerged in a fluid is determined by Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. This depends on the volume of the object submerged and the density of the fluid.

2. As the balloon sinks deeper into the lake, the pressure of the water increases. This increased pressure compresses the balloon, reducing its volume. A smaller volume means less water is displaced, which reduces the buoyant force.

3. Therefore, as the balloon sinks deeper, the buoyant force acting on it decreases due to the reduction in the volume of the balloon.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to determine how many half-lives have passed between noon and 3:00 pm. Since the half-life is 1 hour, and the time elapsed is 3 hours, 3 half-lives have passed.

Next, I calculate the remaining amount of the sample after each half-life. Starting with 1.000 gram:
- After 1 half-life (1 hour), 1.000 g ÷ 2 = 0.500 g remains.
- After 2 half-lives (2 hours), 0.500 g ÷ 2 = 0.250 g remains.
- After 3 half-lives (3 hours), 0.250 g ÷ 2 = 0.125 g remains.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider the conditions under which boiling and freezing occur. Boiling happens when the vapor pressure of water equals the atmospheric pressure, which can be influenced by temperature and pressure. Freezing occurs when water transitions to ice at lower temperatures.

Next, decreased temperatures would lead to freezing but not boiling, so this is not the correct answer. Decreased atmospheric pressure lowers the boiling point but does not directly cause freezing, so this is also not the correct answer.

Finally, increased temperatures cause boiling, and increased atmospheric pressure raises the boiling point but does not directly cause freezing. Therefore, the correct answer is related to increased temperatures for boiling.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the forces acting on the branch when it is bent. When you hang on the end of the branch, it bends downward.

Next, I analyze the top side of the branch. As the branch bends, the top side is stretched, which means it is under tension.

Finally, I confirm that the bottom side of the branch would be compressed, but the question specifically asks about the top side. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the choices step by step:

1. Satellites orbit Earth due to the balance between gravitational force pulling them inward and their tangential velocity, which keeps them moving in a curved path. This eliminates option b, as satellites are not beyond Earth's gravity.

2. Satellites are not in mechanical equilibrium because there is a net force acting on them (gravitational force). This eliminates option c.

3. The concept of centripetal force is relevant, but it is not a separate force; it is the result of gravitational force acting as the centripetal force. While option a is partially correct, it does not fully explain the situation.

4. Satellites maintain their orbit because they have sufficient tangential velocity to continuously ""fall around"" Earth rather than directly into it. This is the most accurate description.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
