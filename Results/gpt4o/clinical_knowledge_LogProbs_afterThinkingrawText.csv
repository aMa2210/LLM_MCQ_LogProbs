"First, I need to consider that for rapid blood transfusion, a larger cannula size is preferred to allow for faster flow rates.  
Next, I know that the smaller the gauge number, the larger the cannula size.  
Among the options, an 18 gauge cannula is the largest and would be most suitable for rapid blood transfusion.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the key attribute in successful marathon running, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Marathon running is a long-distance endurance sport, typically requiring sustained effort over a prolonged period.
2. Strength and power (options a and b) are more critical for short bursts of activity, such as sprinting or weightlifting, rather than endurance sports like marathons.
3. Stride length (option c) can contribute to running efficiency, but it is not the primary factor for success in a marathon.
4. Stamina (option d) is the ability to sustain prolonged physical or mental effort, which is essential for completing and excelling in a marathon.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify the most common cause of dementia in the UK. Alzheimer's disease is widely recognized as the leading cause of dementia globally, including in the UK. It accounts for the majority of dementia cases.  
Next, cerebrovascular disease (stroke) is another cause of dementia, but it is less common than Alzheimer's disease.  
Lewy body dementia and HIV infection are also causes of dementia, but they are significantly less common compared to Alzheimer's disease.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which is NOT a symptom of anaphylaxis, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can involve multiple organ systems. Common symptoms include respiratory distress (e.g., stridor, wheezing), cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension), skin symptoms (e.g., rash, hives), and gastrointestinal symptoms.

2. Stridor (a) is a high-pitched sound caused by airway obstruction and is a known symptom of anaphylaxis due to swelling in the throat or upper airway.

3. Bradycardia (b), which is a slower-than-normal heart rate, is not typically associated with anaphylaxis. Instead, tachycardia (a fast heart rate) is more common due to the body's response to low blood pressure and stress.

4. Severe wheeze (c) is a common symptom of anaphylaxis, as it indicates lower airway obstruction or bronchospasm.

5. Rash (d), such as hives or urticaria, is a hallmark symptom of anaphylaxis and is often one of the first signs.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the purpose of closed pouches. Closed pouches are typically used for patients with colostomies who have more predictable and formed stool output. They are not designed for liquid output or urostomies, as those require drainable or specialized pouches.

Next, I need to evaluate the options:
a) Semi-formed or liquid output would require a drainable pouch, not a closed pouch.
b) Patients with colostomies often have more formed stool, making closed pouches suitable for them.
c) In the immediate post-operative period, output is often unpredictable, so drainable pouches are preferred.
d) Urostomies involve liquid output (urine), which requires a specialized pouch with a drainage system.

Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the physiological changes that occur with repeated sprints. During repeated sprints, the body relies on both anaerobic and aerobic energy systems. 

Next, as the number of sprints increases, the anaerobic energy system becomes less efficient due to the accumulation of metabolic byproducts like lactate and hydrogen ions, which can lead to muscle fatigue. This shifts the energy reliance more towards the aerobic system.

Finally, the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases with repeated sprints because it is more sustainable over time compared to anaerobic metabolism.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a: Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered.**
   - Diplopia (double vision) can be either binocular or monocular. Binocular diplopia occurs when both eyes are open and is resolved when one eye is covered. However, monocular diplopia can still occur even if one eye is covered. Therefore, this statement is **false**.

2. **Option b: The outer image is always the false image.**
   - In cases of binocular diplopia caused by extraocular muscle or nerve dysfunction, the false image is typically the one seen by the affected eye. Depending on the alignment of the eyes, the false image may not always be the outer image. Therefore, this statement is **false**.

3. **Option c: A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards.**
   - The fourth cranial nerve (trochlear nerve) innervates the superior oblique muscle, which primarily helps in downward and inward eye movement. A fourth nerve palsy typically causes difficulty looking downward, especially when the eye is adducted (e.g., reading or descending stairs). This statement is **false**.

4. **Option d: A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint.**
   - The sixth cranial nerve (abducens nerve) innervates the lateral rectus muscle, which abducts the eye (moves it outward). A sixth nerve palsy results in an inability to abduct the affected eye, leading to a convergent squint (esotropia), not a divergent squint. This statement is **false**.

After analyzing all options, none of the statements provided are true. However, if you have additional context or clarification, feel free to provide it."
"First, I need to understand the role of sodium bicarbonate in exercise performance. Sodium bicarbonate acts as a buffering agent, helping to neutralize acid in the body. During intense exercise, hydrogen ions accumulate in the muscles, leading to a decrease in pH (acidosis), which can impair performance.

Next, I consider how sodium bicarbonate works. By increasing the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid, it facilitates the removal (efflux) of hydrogen ions from the muscle into the extracellular space, reducing acidosis in the muscle and improving performance.

Finally, I evaluate the options. The correct answer should reflect the mechanism of sodium bicarbonate in elevating extracellular pH and buffering capacity, allowing faster efflux of hydrogen ions from the muscle.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to recall what codons are. Codons are sequences of three nucleotide bases that correspond to specific amino acids or stop signals during protein synthesis.

Next, I need to identify the correct description of codons from the choices. Codons are triplet sequences of nucleotide bases found in mRNA or DNA, which are used to encode amino acids.

The other options are incorrect because:
- Quadruplet sequences (b) are not how codons are structured.
- Codons are not composed of amino acids (c), but rather they encode amino acids.
- Codons are not sequences of deoxyribose sugars (d), as they are sequences of nucleotide bases.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Fatty acids need to be transported into the mitochondria for Î²-oxidation, which occurs in the mitochondrial matrix.
2. However, fatty acids cannot cross the inner mitochondrial membrane directly. They are first activated in the cytosol by being bound to coenzyme A (CoA), forming fatty acyl-CoA.
3. To cross the inner mitochondrial membrane, fatty acyl-CoA is temporarily bound to carnitine, forming fatty acyl-carnitine. This transport is facilitated by the carnitine shuttle system.
4. Once inside the mitochondrial matrix, the fatty acyl group is transferred back to CoA, and carnitine is recycled.

Thus, fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria bound to carnitine.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the compatible blood types for a person with blood group B (rhesus negative), I will follow these steps:

1. A person with blood group B can receive blood from donors with blood group B or blood group O because these groups do not have incompatible antigens.
2. Since the recipient is rhesus negative, they can only receive blood from donors who are also rhesus negative to avoid a reaction caused by the rhesus factor.
3. Therefore, the compatible blood types are blood type B (rhesus negative) and blood type O (rhesus negative).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a: It leads to increased tone in the arm (hypertonia)**  
   - Lower motor neurone lesions typically result in decreased tone (hypotonia) rather than increased tone. Hypertonia is more characteristic of upper motor neurone lesions.  
   - This option is incorrect.

2. **Option b: Fasciculations are never seen**  
   - Fasciculations, which are involuntary muscle twitches, are a hallmark of lower motor neurone lesions. Therefore, saying they are ""never seen"" is incorrect.  
   - This option is incorrect.

3. **Option c: The reflexes are brisk**  
   - Lower motor neurone lesions result in reduced or absent reflexes, not brisk reflexes. Brisk reflexes are associated with upper motor neurone lesions.  
   - This option is incorrect.

4. **Option d: An ulna nerve palsy is an example of a lower motor neurone lesion**  
   - An ulnar nerve palsy involves damage to the peripheral nerve, which is part of the lower motor neurone system. This is a correct example of a lower motor neurone lesion.  
   - This option is correct.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the false statement, let's analyze each option step by step:

a) Ammonia is produced in repeated high-intensity exercise.  
- This is true. Ammonia is a byproduct of amino acid metabolism and is produced during high-intensity exercise due to increased reliance on anaerobic energy systems and protein breakdown.

b) Muscle lactate accumulation does not begin until at least 5 seconds of intermittent muscle contractions have taken place.  
- This is false. Lactate accumulation can begin almost immediately during high-intensity exercise as anaerobic glycolysis is activated. It does not require 5 seconds to start accumulating.

c) Muscle phosphocreatine depletion begins in the first few seconds of high-intensity exercise.  
- This is true. Phosphocreatine is a rapidly available energy source and is utilized within the first few seconds of high-intensity exercise.

d) With an increasing number of repeated sprints, the rate of accumulation of lactate in muscle declines.  
- This is true. As repeated sprints continue, muscle fatigue and reduced glycolytic activity can lead to a slower rate of lactate accumulation.

The false statement is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, glycogen breakdown in muscle involves the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, which cleaves glycogen to release glucose residues.  
Next, the glucose residues are released in the form of glucose-1-phosphate, not free glucose.  
Finally, glucose-1-phosphate can be converted to glucose-6-phosphate for further metabolism.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the principal contractile proteins in skeletal muscle. Contractile proteins are responsible for muscle contraction.  
Next, actin and myosin are the two main proteins that interact to produce muscle contraction. Actin is a thin filament, and myosin is a thick filament.  
Troponin and tropomyosin are regulatory proteins, not the principal contractile proteins.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the key features of a IIIrd cranial nerve palsy. The IIIrd cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) controls most of the eye's movements, the constriction of the pupil, and the opening of the eyelid. A palsy can result in a fixed dilated pupil due to unopposed sympathetic activity.

Next, I need to determine which of the options matches a neurosurgical emergency. A unilateral fixed dilated pupil can indicate compression of the IIIrd cranial nerve, often due to a brain herniation or aneurysm, which is a neurosurgical emergency.

Finally, I confirm that the other options (unilateral or bilateral constricted pupils, or oval-shaped pupils) do not represent IIIrd cranial nerve palsy or a neurosurgical emergency.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a: It always elevates on swallowing**  
   Thyroid swellings typically move upwards on swallowing because the thyroid gland is attached to the trachea and pretracheal fascia. However, not all swellings in the neck that elevate on swallowing are thyroid-related, and some thyroid swellings may not elevate if they are fixed or have other pathological conditions. Therefore, this statement is not always true.

2. **Option b: Lymph node enlargement is a good prognostic sign**  
   Lymph node enlargement in the context of thyroid swelling is often a sign of malignancy or metastasis, which is not a good prognostic sign. This statement is incorrect.

3. **Option c: An ultrasound of the swelling is the best test to determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone**  
   Ultrasound is a valuable tool for assessing the size, structure, and characteristics of a thyroid nodule, but it does not provide information about whether the nodule is actively secreting hormones. A radioactive iodine uptake scan or thyroid function tests (e.g., TSH, T3, T4) are better for determining functional activity. This statement is incorrect.

4. **Option d: A functioning nodule on isotope scanning is unlikely to be due to cancer**  
   A ""functioning"" or ""hot"" nodule on isotope scanning (indicating it is actively taking up iodine and producing thyroid hormone) is generally less likely to be malignant compared to a ""cold"" nodule (which does not take up iodine). This statement is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze each option to determine which is true about hepatomegaly:

a) Emphysema is not a direct cause of hepatomegaly. It may cause the liver to appear displaced downward due to hyperinflated lungs, but it does not cause true liver enlargement.

b) The liver enlarges downwards from the right hypochondrium, not the left hypochondrium. This statement is incorrect.

c) The presence of jaundice, spider naevi, and purpura are clinical signs that suggest liver dysfunction, often associated with chronic alcohol use. This makes this option plausible.

d) The liver is dull to percussion, not resonant. This statement is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: A positive Babinski reflex is not the same as a normal flexor response. A positive Babinski reflex refers to an extensor response (dorsiflexion of the big toe and fanning of the other toes) and is indicative of an upper motor neuron lesion. A normal flexor response involves the toes curling downward.

2. **Option b**: An extensor plantar response (positive Babinski reflex) indicates an upper motor neuron lesion, not a lower motor neuron lesion. This statement is incorrect.

3. **Option c**: The root value of the ankle reflex is indeed S1. The Achilles tendon reflex (ankle reflex) is mediated by the S1 nerve root.

4. **Option d**: The root value of the knee reflex is L3, L4, not L1, L2. The patellar reflex (knee reflex) is mediated by the L3 and L4 nerve roots.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the options and understand the context of facial nerve palsy. Facial nerve palsy can result from either upper motor neuron (UMN) or lower motor neuron (LMN) lesions. 

1. Option a: Bell's palsy is a lower motor neuron lesion, not an upper motor neuron lesion. This statement is incorrect.
2. Option b: Ramsay Hunt Syndrome is caused by reactivation of the Varicella Zoster virus, leading to a lower motor neuron lesion, not an upper motor neuron lesion. This statement is incorrect.
3. Option c: An inability to close the eyelid on the affected side is a hallmark of a lower motor neuron lesion, as it affects the entire side of the face. This statement is correct.
4. Option d: In Bell's palsy, the sense of taste can be affected because the facial nerve also carries taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. This statement is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify what a Colles fracture is. A Colles fracture is a specific type of fracture that occurs in the distal radius, near the wrist, often caused by falling onto an outstretched hand. 

Next, I need to match this definition with the choices provided. The correct choice should describe a fracture of the radius and ulna at the wrist.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the standard protocol for handling a suspected transfusion reaction. The priority is to stop the transfusion immediately to prevent further complications. 

Next, it is essential to inform the medical staff immediately so they can assess the patient and take appropriate action. 

Finally, following the transfusion policy advice ensures that the correct procedures are followed, including documentation and any necessary interventions.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the guidelines for blood product transfusion. Blood products, once removed from refrigeration, are at risk of bacterial growth and deterioration if not used promptly.  
Next, according to standard medical guidelines as of 2020, the transfusion should begin within a specific time frame to ensure safety and efficacy.  
Finally, the recommended time frame for starting a transfusion after removing blood from refrigeration is within 30 minutes.  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze the statements and determine which one aligns with the data about informal carers as of 2020.  
a) 50% of over 65s providing informal care seems too high and unlikely based on general statistics.  
b) One in six over 65s providing informal care is a plausible statistic and aligns with known data trends.  
c) Informal carers should not be included in discharge planning is incorrect, as informal carers are often crucial in discharge planning.  
d) The majority of informal carers being fit and active is not necessarily true, as many carers face physical and mental health challenges.  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which process is not used to modify protein structure after translation, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Lipidation**: This is a post-translational modification where lipid molecules are attached to a protein, often to anchor it to a membrane. This is a valid post-translational modification.

2. **Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds**: Proteins are synthesized during translation, and the addition of amino acids via peptide bonds occurs during this process. After translation, proteins are not modified by adding more amino acids via peptide bonds. This is not a post-translational modification.

3. **Glycosylation**: This is a common post-translational modification where sugar molecules are attached to a protein, often affecting its stability, localization, or function. This is a valid post-translational modification.

4. **Phosphorylation**: This is another common post-translational modification where phosphate groups are added to specific amino acids in a protein, often regulating its activity. This is a valid post-translational modification.

Based on this analysis, the process that is not used to modify protein structure after translation is **b) Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds**.

{'sol': 'b'}"
"First, I need to understand the purpose of a bladder washout. A bladder washout is typically performed to clear blockages or debris in the catheter or bladder. 

Next, I analyze the options:
a) When their urine is clear: This does not indicate a need for a bladder washout, as clear urine suggests no blockage or debris.
b) When the catheter is blocked: This is a valid reason for a bladder washout, as it helps to remove the blockage.
c) When the catheter is bypassing: This could indicate a blockage or other issue, but the primary reason for a bladder washout is to address blockages.
d) When the catheter is dirty: Cleaning the catheter externally does not require a bladder washout.

Finally, the most appropriate reason for a bladder washout is when the catheter is blocked. 

{'sol': 'b'}"
"First, I need to consider the purpose of a 14-16 gauge needle. These are large-bore needles typically used for rapid fluid administration or blood transfusion due to their wide diameter.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. For children and elderly patients, smaller gauge needles (higher numbers) are generally preferred due to their smaller veins and more delicate tissues. Similarly, inserting in the back of the hand usually requires smaller gauge needles to avoid damage to the smaller veins in that area.

Finally, trauma or burns patients often require rapid fluid resuscitation or blood transfusion, which necessitates the use of large-bore needles like 14-16 gauge.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the features step by step:

1. **Pleural friction rub** is typically associated with inflammation of the pleura, and it produces a grating or crackling sound that is often more prominent during both inspiration and expiration. It is not usually altered by coughing, as it is related to the pleural surfaces rubbing against each other.

2. **Crackles**, on the other hand, are more likely to be altered by coughing, as they are often caused by fluid or secretions in the airways.

3. Pain over the area is a common feature of pleural friction rub due to the inflammation of the pleura, whereas crackles are not associated with pain.

4. Clubbing is not directly related to distinguishing between pleural friction rub and crackles.

Based on this analysis, the feature that suggests a pleural friction rub over crackles is **""alters with coughing""**, as pleural friction rub does not typically change with coughing.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the physiological response of the body during a soccer game. Blood lactate concentration increases during high-intensity activities due to anaerobic metabolism. 

Next, I need to analyze the pattern of activity in soccer. Soccer involves intermittent high-intensity efforts, which can lead to fluctuations in blood lactate levels. However, as the game progresses, players may experience fatigue, and their ability to sustain high-intensity efforts may decrease.

Finally, I need to evaluate the specific options. Blood lactate concentration is typically higher at the end of the first half due to the accumulation of high-intensity efforts. By the end of the game, players may not sustain the same intensity, leading to lower lactate levels compared to the end of the first half.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider how lactate and hydrogen ions are transported out of the muscle. Lactate and hydrogen ions are byproducts of anaerobic metabolism and need to be removed efficiently to prevent acidosis.

Next, I know that simple diffusion is unlikely because lactate and hydrogen ions require specific mechanisms to cross the cell membrane due to their charge and size.

Finally, the most common mechanism for their removal involves a protein transporter molecule, specifically the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT), which facilitates the cotransport of lactate and hydrogen ions out of the muscle.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate each option to determine which statement is true about the spine.

a) Back pain is an uncommon complaint: This is incorrect because back pain is one of the most common complaints in clinical practice.

b) Schober's test is designed to quantify the flexion of the lumbar spine: This is correct. Schober's test is a clinical test used to measure the range of motion and flexibility of the lumbar spine, particularly in conditions like ankylosing spondylitis.

c) Ankylosing spondylitis is a cause of hypermobility of the spine: This is incorrect because ankylosing spondylitis typically causes stiffness and reduced mobility of the spine due to inflammation and fusion of the vertebrae.

d) Pregnancy is a cause of loss of lordosis of the lumbar spine: This is incorrect because pregnancy often leads to an increase in lumbar lordosis due to the shift in the center of gravity.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a: The absence of plaques of psoriasis excludes the diagnosis**  
   This is incorrect. Psoriatic arthropathy can occur even in the absence of visible skin plaques. Some patients may have a history of psoriasis or only subtle signs like nail changes.

2. **Option b: The diagnosis can be confirmed by a blood marker**  
   This is incorrect. There is no specific blood marker for psoriatic arthritis. Diagnosis is typically clinical, based on symptoms, physical findings, and imaging studies.

3. **Option c: Tophi can sometimes be seen over affected joints**  
   This is incorrect. Tophi are associated with gout, not psoriatic arthritis.

4. **Option d: Nail pitting may give a clue to the diagnosis**  
   This is correct. Nail pitting is a common feature in psoriatic arthritis and can provide a clue to the diagnosis, even in the absence of skin plaques.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze each option to determine which is true about Graves' Disease of the thyroid.

1. Option a) Graves' Disease can cause ophthalmoplegia, as it is associated with thyroid eye disease, which can lead to eye muscle dysfunction and movement issues.
2. Option b) Graves' Disease typically causes a diffuse goiter, not a multi-nodular goiter, which is more characteristic of other thyroid conditions like multinodular goiter.
3. Option c) Graves' Disease is more common in females than males, with a higher prevalence in women.
4. Option d) 'Derbyshire Neck' refers to iodine deficiency-related goiter, not Graves' Disease, which is an autoimmune condition.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze each statement to determine its accuracy:

1. Calcitonin causes a rise in plasma calcium: This is incorrect because calcitonin lowers plasma calcium levels by inhibiting bone resorption and increasing calcium excretion in the kidneys.

2. Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic: This is correct. Primary hyperparathyroidism often presents without symptoms and is commonly discovered incidentally through elevated calcium levels in blood tests.

3. Vitamin D is secreted by the parathyroid glands: This is incorrect. Vitamin D is not secreted by the parathyroid glands; it is synthesized in the skin and activated in the liver and kidneys.

4. Oliguria is a symptom of hypercalcaemia: This is incorrect. Hypercalcaemia typically causes polyuria (increased urination) rather than oliguria (reduced urination).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall what kinase reactions are. Kinases are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of phosphate groups, typically from ATP to a substrate molecule.  
Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) is incorrect because kinases do not inhibit ATP breakdown; they use ATP as a phosphate donor. Option b) is correct because kinase reactions involve the addition or removal of a phosphate group. Option c) is incorrect because kinases do not involve ketone groups. Option d) is incorrect because kinases do not add or remove amino acids to polypeptide chains.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall the normal respiratory rate range for an adult male. The typical range for a healthy adult is between 12 and 20 breaths per minute.  
Next, I need to compare the given choices to this range.  
The only option that falls within this range is 14-16 breaths per minute.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the role of collagen fibers in wound healing. Collagen fibers are essential for providing strength and structure to the healing tissue. 

Next, I need to evaluate the timeline of collagen fiber re-establishment. Collagen synthesis and deposition typically begin after the initial inflammatory phase, which lasts a few days, and continue during the proliferative and remodeling phases of wound healing. This indicates that collagen fibers take some time to re-establish.

Finally, I need to assess the other options. Collagen fibers do not provide a bridge across the wound surface; instead, they are deposited within the wound to strengthen the tissue. They are also needed in both primary and secondary intention healing to restore tissue integrity.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which substance releases the most energy when completely oxidized in the body, I will consider the energy yield per gram of each substance:

1. **Glucose**: Glucose is a carbohydrate, and its complete oxidation yields approximately 4 kcal per gram.
2. **Palmitic acid**: Palmitic acid is a fatty acid, and fats generally yield more energy than carbohydrates or proteins. The complete oxidation of palmitic acid yields approximately 9 kcal per gram.
3. **Leucine**: Leucine is an amino acid, and proteins typically yield around 4 kcal per gram when oxidized, similar to carbohydrates.
4. **Alcohol**: Alcohol (ethanol) yields approximately 7 kcal per gram when completely oxidized.

Comparing these values, palmitic acid releases the most energy per gram when completely oxidized.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the location and function of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The inner membrane of the mitochondrion is where oxidative phosphorylation occurs, and it contains the components necessary for this process.

Next, I need to determine which of the options is associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane. The enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle) are located in the mitochondrial matrix, not the inner membrane. Glycogen and triacylglycerol molecules are not associated with the mitochondria's inner membrane.

Finally, the components of the electron transport chain, which are involved in oxidative phosphorylation, are embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. These components include protein complexes and electron carriers.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I need to calculate the rate of energy expenditure based on the oxygen consumption rate. 

1. The energy expenditure can be estimated using the fact that 1 liter of oxygen consumed corresponds to approximately 20 kJ of energy expenditure. 
2. The athlete's oxygen consumption rate is 2 liters per minute. Therefore, the energy expenditure rate is 2 liters/min Ã 20 kJ/liter = 40 kJ/min.
3. Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to recall the normal range for an adult's resting heart rate. The typical range is widely accepted to be between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm).  
Next, I compare this range with the given options.  
Option b) 60-100 bpm matches the standard range for a normal adult resting heart rate.  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate each statement:

a) Phosphofructokinase is indeed the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, as it controls the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. This statement is true.

b) Phosphorylase activity, which is involved in glycogen breakdown, is higher in Type II (fast-twitch) fibers than in Type I (slow-twitch) fibers due to the higher glycolytic capacity of Type II fibers. This statement is true.

c) Endurance training increases the amount of TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle enzymes in muscle, as it enhances oxidative metabolism. This statement is true.

d) Oxygen is not directly consumed in the TCA cycle; it is consumed in the electron transport chain, which is coupled to the TCA cycle. This statement is false.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze each option to determine which is true in the context of ulnar nerve palsy.

1. Option a: The ulnar nerve is not typically affected by a fracture of the spiral groove of the humerus. The radial nerve is more commonly involved in such fractures.
2. Option b: A positive Phalen's sign is associated with carpal tunnel syndrome, which involves the median nerve, not the ulnar nerve.
3. Option c: The ulnar nerve does indeed provide sensation to the medial half of the hand and the medial one and a half digits on both the palmar and dorsal aspects of the hand. This is consistent with ulnar nerve palsy.
4. Option d: The ulnar nerve does not supply the biceps muscle; the musculocutaneous nerve is responsible for innervating the biceps.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider the general dental recommendations for toothpaste usage. For adults, a pea-sized amount of toothpaste is typically recommended to effectively clean teeth without overusing fluoride. 

Next, I should evaluate the other options. A smear is usually recommended for young children to minimize fluoride ingestion, not for general use. The length of the toothbrush and half an inch are excessive amounts and not advised.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze the options and understand the characteristics of Cushing's Syndrome.  
Cushing's Syndrome is caused by an excess of cortisol hormone, not a deficiency, so option a is incorrect.  
Enlarged extremities are not a feature of Cushing's Syndrome; this is more characteristic of acromegaly, so option b is incorrect.  
Osteoporosis is a common feature of Cushing's Syndrome due to the effects of excess cortisol on bone metabolism, so option c is incorrect.  
A moon face and a buffalo hump are hallmark features of Cushing's Syndrome due to fat redistribution caused by excess cortisol, so option d is correct.  

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) ""a high energy diet and large appetite"" - While a proper diet is important for athletes, it is not the main factor determining success in sports. Other factors like training and ability play a more significant role.

2. Option b) ""high intelligence and motivation to succeed"" - Intelligence may not be a primary determinant of success in sports. Motivation is important, but intelligence alone is not a key factor.

3. Option c) ""a good coach and the motivation to succeed"" - A good coach and motivation are important, but they are not the only factors. Innate ability and training response are also crucial.

4. Option d) ""innate ability and the capacity to respond to the training stimulus"" - This option highlights the natural talent (innate ability) and the ability to improve through training, which are fundamental to success in sports.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's think step by step:

1. DNA is composed of two strands that are complementary to each other. The purines (adenine and guanine) always pair with pyrimidines (thymine and cytosine) through hydrogen bonding. Specifically, adenine pairs with thymine, and guanine pairs with cytosine.

2. Because of this base-pairing rule, the number of purines in a double-stranded DNA molecule will always equal the number of pyrimidines. This ensures that the ratio of purines to pyrimidines is always 1:1.

3. This is a fundamental property of DNA structure and is not variable, nor is it determined by RNA or genetic factors.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify which hormone synthetic steroids are structurally based on. Synthetic steroids are designed to mimic the effects of natural anabolic steroids in the body.  
Next, anabolic steroids are primarily associated with muscle growth and performance enhancement, which are functions linked to testosterone.  
Finally, testosterone is the hormone that synthetic anabolic steroids are modeled after to enhance performance and muscle mass.  

{'sol': 'a'}"
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Glycogen breakdown in muscle is primarily regulated by hormones and intracellular signals. Insulin promotes glycogen synthesis, not breakdown, so option (a) is incorrect.

2. Cortisol is a stress hormone that promotes gluconeogenesis and protein breakdown but does not directly activate glycogen breakdown in muscle during exercise. Thus, option (b) is incorrect.

3. Increased pH (alkalinity) is not a physiological trigger for glycogen breakdown. In fact, during exercise, muscle pH typically decreases (becomes more acidic) due to lactic acid production. Therefore, option (c) is incorrect.

4. The correct answer is ""none of the above,"" as none of the provided options directly activate glycogen breakdown in exercising muscle. Glycogen breakdown is actually activated by signals such as increased levels of epinephrine and calcium ions during exercise.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Free fatty acids are not transported inside red blood cells (RBCs), as RBCs primarily carry oxygen and carbon dioxide, and they lack the mechanisms to transport fatty acids. So, option a) is incorrect.

2. Lipoproteins are responsible for transporting triglycerides, cholesterol, and other lipids, but free fatty acids are not typically transported as part of lipoproteins. So, option b) is incorrect.

3. Free fatty acids are not combined with glucose for transport in the blood. Glucose is transported independently in the blood. So, option c) is incorrect.

4. Free fatty acids are transported in the blood bound to albumin, a protein that acts as a carrier for hydrophobic molecules like fatty acids. This is the correct mechanism of transport.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer:

1. A cannula should be flushed regularly to maintain patency and prevent blockages or infections. The frequency of flushing depends on the type of cannula and institutional protocols.
2. Generally, for most peripheral intravenous cannulas, flushing is recommended every 8 to 12 hours if not in use, or as per hospital guidelines.
3. Among the given options, the most commonly recommended interval aligns with every 8 hours.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Creatine kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible reaction between creatine phosphate and ADP to produce ATP and creatine. Its activity is typically increased when there is a demand for ATP, such as when intracellular ADP levels rise. This makes option a) plausible.

2. A fall in muscle pH (below 6.9) usually occurs during intense exercise due to lactic acid accumulation. However, low pH can inhibit enzyme activity, including creatine kinase, rather than increase it. This makes option b) unlikely.

3. Type II muscle fibers (fast-twitch) are more glycolytic and rely more on creatine phosphate for quick energy bursts, so they generally have higher creatine kinase activity compared to Type I fibers (slow-twitch). This makes option c) incorrect.

4. Endurance training typically enhances oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial function, reducing reliance on the creatine phosphate system. Therefore, creatine kinase activity is not significantly increased after endurance training. This makes option d) unlikely.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the smallest increments on a mercury and aneroid sphygmomanometer:

1. A mercury sphygmomanometer typically has a scale with increments of 2 mmHg, as it is designed for precise blood pressure measurements.
2. Similarly, an aneroid sphygmomanometer also has a scale with increments of 2 mmHg for consistency and accuracy in readings.
3. Therefore, the smallest increments on both types of sphygmomanometers are 2 mmHg.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the abnormal breathing patterns associated with head injury and altered consciousness. Cheyne-Stokes respiration, hyperventilation, and ataxic breathing are all known abnormal breathing patterns linked to neurological damage or head injury.

Next, I need to evaluate anaerobic respiration. Anaerobic respiration is a metabolic process that occurs in cells when oxygen is scarce, not a breathing pattern. It is unrelated to the physical act of breathing or respiratory patterns.

Finally, since anaerobic respiration is not a breathing pattern, it is the correct answer.

{'sol': 'b'}"
"First, I need to recall the standard CPR guidelines. For adult CPR, the recommended ratio of chest compressions to ventilations is 30:2.  
Next, I will compare the given choices to identify the correct ratio.  
The correct ratio of 30:2 matches option d).  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to calculate the total drug dose in milligrams. The dose is 15 mg/kg, and the person weighs 62 kg. So, the total dose is 15 * 62 = 930 mg.

Next, I need to convert milligrams to grams. Since 1 gram = 1000 milligrams, I divide 930 mg by 1000 to get 0.93 grams.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the effects of creatine supplementation. Creatine is commonly used to improve athletic performance and increase muscle mass.  
Next, I need to evaluate the options. Muscle weakness (a) is not a typical side effect of creatine; in fact, it is often associated with increased strength. Muscle cramps (c) and loss of electrolytes (d) are not consistently reported as side effects of creatine supplementation.  
Finally, gain in body mass (b) is a well-documented and expected side effect of creatine supplementation, primarily due to water retention in the muscles and increased muscle mass over time.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall the phases of the cardiac cycle. The cardiac cycle consists of two main phases: diastole (when the heart relaxes and fills with blood) and systole (when the heart contracts and pumps blood out). 

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a includes ""rest,"" which is not a standard phase of the cardiac cycle. Option b mentions ""contraction, relaxation, and rest,"" but ""rest"" is not a recognized phase. Option d includes ""diastole, systole, and contraction,"" but ""contraction"" is already part of systole, making it redundant. Option c correctly identifies the two main phases: diastole and systole.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate each option to determine its relevance to success in sport.  
1. Ability to tolerate heavy training without succumbing to illness or injury is crucial for consistent performance and improvement, so it influences success in sport.  
2. Tactics are essential in many sports as they determine how a player or team approaches competition, so they also influence success.  
3. The diet is a key factor in providing the necessary energy and nutrients for optimal performance and recovery, so it influences success as well.  
4. Ingestion of carnitine during exercise is not widely recognized as a significant factor influencing success in sport, as its benefits are not strongly supported by evidence.  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the correct sequence of the chain of survival. The first step is recognizing the emergency and calling for help early (3).  
Next, early CPR (2) is performed to maintain circulation and oxygenation.  
Then, early defibrillation (1) is applied to restore a normal heart rhythm.  
Finally, post-resuscitation care (4) is provided to ensure recovery and prevent complications.  
The correct order is 3, 2, 1, 4.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a: A fall in the cell concentration of ADP** - This is unlikely because ADP is a product of ATP breakdown, and during high-intensity exercise, ADP levels typically increase rather than decrease.

2. **Option b: Inhibition of ATP production** - While ATP production may be limited during high-intensity exercise, it is not directly ""inhibited."" Instead, the issue is more about the supply of ATP not meeting the demand.

3. **Option c: Failure of the ATP supply to match the demand** - This is a fundamental cause of fatigue during high-intensity exercise. The muscles require ATP at a very high rate, and when the supply cannot keep up with the demand, fatigue sets in.

4. **Option d: Lack of skill** - This is unrelated to the physiological cause of fatigue during high-intensity exercise.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate each statement to determine its accuracy:

1. **Statement a**: The finding of a palpable median groove in the prostate is an adverse finding.  
   - The median groove in the prostate is a normal anatomical feature. Its presence typically indicates a healthy prostate, while its absence may suggest conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or prostate cancer. Therefore, this statement is false.

2. **Statement b**: Impacted faeces can sometimes be mistaken for a rectal tumour.  
   - Impacted faeces in the rectum can feel firm and irregular on digital rectal examination, which may mimic the feel of a rectal tumour. This is a true statement.

3. **Statement c**: A thrombosed haemorrhoid is painless.  
   - Thrombosed haemorrhoids are usually associated with significant pain due to the clot formation and inflammation. Therefore, this statement is false.

4. **Statement d**: Peri-anal warts can only be demonstrated on proctoscopy.  
   - Peri-anal warts are external lesions and can often be visualized during a physical examination without the need for proctoscopy. Therefore, this statement is false.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand what skin excoriation is. It refers to damage or abrasion to the skin, often caused by irritation or friction.  
Next, I need to evaluate the options. A well-fitting pouch (a) would prevent leakage and protect the skin, so it is unlikely to cause excoriation. Changing the pouch every day (b) might not directly cause excoriation unless done improperly. Leakage of effluent onto peristomal skin (c) can irritate and damage the skin, making it a likely cause. The use of unscented soap (d) is generally gentle and unlikely to cause excoriation.  
Therefore, the most likely cause of skin excoriation is leakage of effluent onto peristomal skin.  
The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Systemic Sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis, vascular abnormalities, and immune system activation. Letâs analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a**: Systemic Sclerosis affects females more than males, with a female-to-male ratio of approximately 4:1. Therefore, this statement is false.

2. **Option b**: Telangiectasia (dilated blood vessels) can be seen in Systemic Sclerosis, but their presence alone does not clinch the diagnosis. Other clinical features and investigations are required for a definitive diagnosis. Thus, this statement is false.

3. **Option c**: Arachnodactyly (long, slender fingers) is not a feature of Systemic Sclerosis. It is more commonly associated with Marfan syndrome. Systemic Sclerosis is characterized by sclerodactyly (thickening and tightening of the skin on the fingers). Hence, this statement is false.

4. **Option d**: A beaked-shaped nose and waxy skin are characteristic features of Systemic Sclerosis due to skin tightening and fibrosis. This statement is true.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand what a palpable left parasternal impulse indicates. This finding is typically associated with increased activity or enlargement of the right ventricle.  
Next, I consider the choices. Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) is a condition where the right ventricle becomes enlarged or overworked, which can lead to a palpable impulse in the left parasternal area.  
Finally, I evaluate the other options. Aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and left ventricular hypertrophy are more associated with left-sided heart abnormalities and would not typically cause a left parasternal impulse.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this:

1. Hypovolaemic shock occurs when there is a significant loss of blood volume, leading to inadequate perfusion of tissues. The body compensates for mild blood loss by mechanisms such as vasoconstriction and increased heart rate, but these changes may not immediately affect measurable parameters like heart rate and blood pressure.
2. Typically, the loss of up to 10% of blood volume is well-compensated by the body without significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure. Beyond this threshold, compensatory mechanisms may start to fail, and measurable changes in vital signs become evident.
3. Therefore, the percentage of blood loss before changes in heart rate and blood pressure are observed is approximately 10%.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the primary effects of morphine. Morphine is an opioid analgesic, which means it is primarily used to reduce pain intensity. 

Next, I need to evaluate the secondary effects of morphine. Morphine is known to cause sedation as a common side effect, along with other effects like respiratory depression and constipation, but not alertness, diarrhoea, or insomnia.

Finally, I compare the options. The correct description is that morphine reduces pain intensity but also causes sedation.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: ""When associated with neck stiffness is always due to meningitis"" - This is incorrect because while neck stiffness can be a symptom of meningitis, it is not always the cause. Other conditions, such as tension headaches or cervical spine issues, can also cause neck stiffness.

2. **Option b**: ""Severe pain usually indicates a life-threatening cause"" - This is incorrect because severe pain does not always indicate a life-threatening condition. For example, migraines can cause severe pain but are not life-threatening.

3. **Option c**: ""Temporal arteritis is strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis"" - This is incorrect because while temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis) can occur in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica, it is not strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis.

4. **Option d**: ""Tension headaches is a common cause of headache"" - This is correct because tension headaches are indeed one of the most common types of headaches experienced by individuals.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the function of the arteries and their role in maintaining blood flow. Arteries have elastic walls that stretch during ventricular contraction (systole) to accommodate the surge of blood.

Next, during ventricular relaxation (diastole), the elastic walls of the arteries recoil, which helps to maintain blood flow even when the heart is not actively pumping.

Finally, this elastic recoil is a key mechanism that ensures continuous blood flow through the vessels between heartbeats. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify the factors that could directly affect a patient's ability to use an inhaler. Severe leg ulcers (a) and forthcoming surgery (c) are unlikely to impact inhaler use as they do not directly relate to the respiratory system or the ability to use the device. Previous recovery from an acute exacerbation of asthma (b) indicates a history of asthma but does not necessarily imply difficulty in using an inhaler. Poor technique, physical impairment, or lack of understanding (d) directly relates to the ability to use an inhaler effectively. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the context of adhesive strips, which are often used in medical settings to close wounds or secure dressings.  
Next, I need to evaluate the options. Adhesive strips can typically be removed by the patient unless there are specific medical instructions, so option a) seems plausible.  
Option b) suggests aseptic conditions, which are not usually necessary for removing adhesive strips unless there is a risk of infection.  
Option c) implies it is a specialist skill, which is not accurate as adhesive strip removal is generally straightforward.  
Option d) states they should not be removed until at least seven days after application, which is not universally true as the timing depends on the wound and medical advice.  
The most reasonable answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to recall the standard guidelines for CPR. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), chest compressions should be delivered at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute.  
Next, I need to evaluate the choices. Option a) 80/minute is too slow and does not meet the guideline. Option b) as fast as possible is incorrect because there is an upper limit to the recommended rate. Option c) 100/minute is within the recommended range. Option d) varies with each patient is incorrect because the rate is standardized.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which physiological characteristic is not important for success in endurance events like the marathon race, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **The ability to regulate body temperature (a):** This is crucial for endurance events because maintaining a stable body temperature prevents overheating, which can impair performance and even lead to heat-related illnesses.

2. **The ability to supply oxygen to the exercising muscles (b):** This is essential for endurance events as oxygen is required for aerobic metabolism, which provides the energy needed for prolonged activity.

3. **The availability of body stores of carbohydrate (c):** Carbohydrates are a primary energy source during endurance events. Depletion of glycogen stores can lead to fatigue, commonly referred to as ""hitting the wall.""

4. **Muscle ATP and phosphocreatine content (d):** While ATP and phosphocreatine are important for short bursts of high-intensity activity, they are not the primary energy sources for prolonged endurance events like a marathon. Instead, aerobic metabolism plays a much larger role.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the purpose of rinsing the mouth after using an inhaler. Rinsing the mouth is typically recommended to prevent side effects such as oral thrush, which is a fungal infection that can occur due to the use of steroid inhalers.

Next, I need to identify which type of inhaler is associated with this recommendation. Bronchodilator inhalers are not associated with oral thrush, so rinsing the mouth is not necessary after their use. However, steroid inhalers can leave residue in the mouth, which increases the risk of oral thrush, making rinsing the mouth after their use important.

Finally, I confirm that the correct answer is related to rinsing the mouth after using a steroid inhaler to reduce the risk of oral thrush.

{'sol': 'd'}"
"First, I need to consider the conditions under which muscle lactate production increases. Lactate is produced during anaerobic glycolysis when oxygen availability is limited, and pyruvate is converted to lactate to regenerate NAD+ for continued glycolysis.

Next, I analyze the choices:
a) Oxygen is readily available: This is incorrect because lactate production typically increases when oxygen is limited, not readily available.
b) Pyruvate cannot be formed from glucose breakdown: This is incorrect because pyruvate is a necessary intermediate in glycolysis, and its conversion to lactate is what increases lactate production.
c) The pH of the muscle falls: While lactate production can contribute to a drop in pH, this is a consequence, not a cause, of increased lactate production.
d) Glycolysis is activated at the onset of exercise: This is correct because during intense exercise, glycolysis is activated, and if oxygen delivery is insufficient, lactate production increases as a result of anaerobic metabolism.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the minimum time a stretch should be held for, I will consider the following steps:

1. Research and recommendations from fitness and health experts suggest that holding a stretch for at least 10-30 seconds is effective for improving flexibility and muscle relaxation.
2. Holding a stretch for less than 10 seconds (option a) is generally not sufficient to allow the muscle to relax and lengthen.
3. Holding a stretch for longer than 30 seconds (options c and d) may be beneficial in some cases but is not typically considered the minimum time required.

Based on these considerations, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the three primary factors that regulate stroke volume. Stroke volume is influenced by preload (the degree of stretch of the heart muscle before contraction), contractility (the strength of the heart's contraction), and afterload (the resistance the heart must overcome to eject blood).

Next, I will compare these factors to the options provided. Option b) lists preload, contractility, and afterload, which are the correct factors.

Finally, I confirm that none of the other options include all three correct factors. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the correct order of the bones in the middle finger starting from the hand. The bones of the fingers are called phalanges, and they are arranged in a specific order.  
The first bone closest to the hand is the proximal phalanx.  
The second bone is the middle phalanx.  
The third and last bone at the tip of the finger is the distal phalanx.  
Therefore, the correct order is proximal phalanx, middle phalanx, distal phalanx.  
The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to identify which hormone or substance is responsible for promoting glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle.  
Second, insulin is known to facilitate the uptake of glucose into muscle cells by increasing the number of glucose transporters on the cell membrane. It also promotes amino acid uptake for protein synthesis.  
Third, the other options (adrenaline, glycogen, and cortisol) do not primarily promote glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle. Adrenaline is involved in the fight-or-flight response, glycogen is a storage form of glucose, and cortisol is a stress hormone that promotes gluconeogenesis and protein breakdown.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer:

1. An ileostomy is a surgical opening created in the abdominal wall to allow waste to exit the body when the colon or rectum is not functional.
2. The ideal ileostomy opening should protrude slightly above the skin level to ensure proper drainage and prevent leakage or skin irritation.
3. A length of 3-5 cm is considered appropriate for an ileostomy to function effectively.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the standard procedures before catheterization. Gaining patient consent (a) is a necessary step to ensure ethical practice. Washing the patient (b) is also important for hygiene and to reduce the risk of infection. Checking expiry dates (c) is crucial to ensure the equipment is safe to use. However, ringing the patient's next of kin (d) is not a standard step before catheterization unless there is a specific reason to do so. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the process of hydrogen ion formation. Hydrogen ions are typically formed during metabolic processes that involve the breakdown of glucose or other substrates for energy.

Next, I analyze the choices. Glycogen depletion (a) does not directly result in hydrogen ion formation. Phosphocreatine breakdown (b) is an anaerobic process that does not produce hydrogen ions. Pyruvate conversion to lactate (c) is associated with hydrogen ion formation, but it is a result of glycolysis. Glycolysis (d), when used as a major means of ATP resynthesis, leads to the production of hydrogen ions as a byproduct of the breakdown of glucose.

Finally, the most comprehensive and correct answer is that hydrogen ions are formed when glycolysis is being used as a major means of resynthesizing ATP.

"To determine which manoeuvre is not a central painful stimulus, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Supra-orbital ridge pressure**: This is a central painful stimulus as it targets the supra-orbital nerve, which is part of the central nervous system.

2. **Pressure on the little finger pulp**: This is a peripheral painful stimulus because it targets a peripheral nerve in the finger, not a central location.

3. **Trapezius squeeze**: This is a central painful stimulus as it involves squeezing the trapezius muscle, which is close to the central nervous system.

4. **Sternal rub**: This is a central painful stimulus as it involves applying pressure to the sternum, a central part of the body.

The manoeuvre that is not a central painful stimulus is **pressure on the little finger pulp**.

"First, I need to calculate the dose per minute. The rate is 4 micrograms/kg/min, and the person weighs 65 kg. So, the dose per minute is 4 * 65 = 260 micrograms per minute.

Next, I calculate the dose per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the dose per hour is 260 * 60 = 15,600 micrograms.

Finally, I convert micrograms to milligrams. There are 1,000 micrograms in a milligram, so 15,600 micrograms is 15.6 milligrams.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: ""If the patient refuses a chaperone the doctor can overrule them.""  
   - This is incorrect. A patient has the right to refuse a chaperone, and their autonomy must be respected. The doctor cannot overrule the patient's decision in this regard.

2. **Option b**: ""The rectal examination is of no value in a neurological examination.""  
   - This is incorrect. A rectal examination can provide valuable information in a neurological examination, such as assessing anal tone and reflexes, which are important in evaluating spinal cord or nerve function.

3. **Option c**: ""The optimum position of the patient is on their right side with their knees extended.""  
   - This is incorrect. The optimal position for a rectal examination is typically with the patient lying on their left side with their knees flexed (the left lateral position), not with their knees extended.

4. **Option d**: ""The rectal examination is indicated for the assessment of some gastrointestinal disorders.""  
   - This is correct. A rectal examination is often performed to assess for gastrointestinal disorders such as rectal bleeding, hemorrhoids, or masses.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the function of the cuff. The cuff is inflated in medical devices like tracheostomy tubes to create a seal in the airway, preventing air from escaping around the tube.

Next, when the cuff is inflated, air cannot pass through the vocal cords because the seal blocks the airflow from reaching the upper airway, including the vocal cords.

Finally, since speech requires air to pass through the vocal cords to produce sound, the patient cannot talk when the cuff is inflated.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the importance of monitoring wound drainage in post-operative care. Regular assessment helps in identifying complications such as infection or excessive bleeding. 

Next, I need to determine the frequency of assessment. Since post-operative observations are typically done multiple times a day, assessing wound drainage during these observations ensures timely monitoring without unnecessary delays.

Finally, I compare the options. Assessing drainage ""each time post-operative observations are undertaken"" aligns with the need for regular and timely monitoring, making it the most appropriate choice.

"First, I need to consider the safety and best practices in handling a catheter that resists unblocking or removal. Forcing removal or unblocking could cause harm to the patient.  
Next, leaving the catheter until next time is not a safe option, as it could lead to complications such as infection or further blockage.  
Finally, the appropriate action would be to call for assistance from a medical practitioner, as they have the expertise to handle the situation safely and effectively.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's consider the following steps:

1. Bladder washout solutions are used to irrigate the bladder and remove debris or clots. The temperature of the solution is important to avoid causing discomfort or harm to the patient.
2. A cold solution could cause bladder spasms or discomfort, while a warm solution might be soothing but could also pose risks if too hot.
3. Room temperature solutions are generally considered safe and comfortable for the patient, as they are neither too cold nor too warm.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider that pain management involves a holistic approach, addressing not just the physical aspect but also psychological and emotional factors. 

Next, pharmacological interventions are often necessary, but they should be combined with other strategies to ensure comprehensive care. Regular reassessment is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of the plan and make adjustments as needed.

Next, I need to confirm that none of the other options are related to the APOE gene. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, Huntington's dementia is caused by mutations in the HTT gene, and depression is not directly linked to the APOE gene.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider the effects of each group of drugs. Steroids are not commonly associated with causing dry mouth. Analgesics, which are pain relievers, also do not typically cause dry mouth as a side effect. Antifungal agents are used to treat fungal infections and are not known to cause dry mouth either. Antidepressants, however, are well-known for causing dry mouth as a common side effect due to their impact on the nervous system and salivary glands. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement a**: Muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate.  
   - This is true. Glycogen in muscles is broken down through glycogenolysis, where the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase converts glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate.

2. **Statement b**: Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles.  
   - This is true. Type I muscle fibers (slow-twitch fibers) are highly oxidative and fatigue-resistant, making them ideal for endurance activities.

3. **Statement c**: Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration.  
   - This is true. The liver plays a key role in maintaining blood glucose levels by breaking down glycogen into glucose and releasing it into the bloodstream.

4. **Statement d**: Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body.  
   - This is false. Insulin promotes glucose uptake in most tissues, such as muscle and adipose tissue, but not all tissues. For example, the brain and red blood cells take up glucose independently of insulin.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, cyanosis is a condition where the skin or mucous membranes appear blue due to a lack of oxygen in the blood. This typically occurs when oxygen saturation levels are significantly low.  
Next, oxygen saturation levels below 85% are often associated with cyanosis, as the blood is not carrying enough oxygen to maintain normal coloration.  
Finally, considering the options, the most appropriate choice for a cyanosed patient would be oxygen saturation levels of 80% or below.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

Next, I need to divide the total dose into three equal doses. Dividing 1,500 micrograms by 3 gives 1,500 Ã· 3 = 500 micrograms per dose.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the physiological factors that contribute to peripheral muscle fatigue during high-intensity, repeated sprint activities. Peripheral muscle fatigue is often associated with metabolic byproducts and ion imbalances.

Next, I know that during repeated sprints, the accumulation of inorganic phosphate (Pi) from the breakdown of ATP is a key factor. This accumulation can interfere with muscle contraction by reducing calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and impairing cross-bridge cycling.

Finally, while hyperosmolality, antioxidants, and potassium imbalances can affect muscle function, they are not the primary contributors to peripheral muscle fatigue in this context. The accumulation of inorganic phosphate is the most widely recognized factor.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this:

1. ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the primary energy source for muscle contractions during high-intensity exercise. However, the amount of ATP stored in muscles is limited.
2. The stored ATP in muscles is only sufficient to provide energy for a very short duration of high-intensity activity before other energy systems (like the phosphocreatine system) take over.
3. Research and physiological studies indicate that the ATP store in muscles can supply energy for approximately 2 seconds of high-intensity exercise.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to calculate the total daily dose by determining how many doses are taken in a day. Since the drug is taken every 12 hours, there are 24 Ã· 12 = 2 doses per day.

Next, I calculate the total daily dose in milligrams. Each dose is 960 mg, so the total daily dose is 960 mg Ã 2 = 1920 mg.

Finally, I convert milligrams to grams. Since 1 gram = 1000 milligrams, 1920 mg Ã· 1000 = 1.92 grams.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a) Weight loss**: Hypothyroidism typically causes weight gain due to a slower metabolism, not weight loss. This option is incorrect.

2. **Option b) Pre-tibial myxoedema**: Pre-tibial myxoedema is a characteristic feature of hyperthyroidism, specifically Graves' disease, not hypothyroidism. This option is incorrect.

3. **Option c) A raised TSH level**: In hypothyroidism, the thyroid gland produces insufficient thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). The pituitary gland compensates by increasing the secretion of TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) to stimulate the thyroid gland. Therefore, a raised TSH level is a hallmark of hypothyroidism. This option is correct.

4. **Option d) An aversion to warm places**: Hypothyroidism is associated with cold intolerance, not an aversion to warm places. This option is incorrect.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

"To determine the correct solution for bladder washout in this scenario, I will consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the clinical context**: The patient is three hours post-transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), a procedure that often involves continuous bladder irrigation to prevent clot formation and maintain catheter patency. A blocked catheter suggests the presence of clots or debris.

2. **Identify the appropriate solution**: Normal saline is commonly used for bladder irrigation because it is isotonic and safe for the bladder. Using a solution that is not isotonic could cause complications, such as irritation or electrolyte imbalances.

3. **Evaluate the options**: Among the choices provided, ""Normal saline"" is the most appropriate and widely used solution for bladder washout in this context.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. A keloid is not evidence of infection. It is a type of scar tissue that forms due to an overgrowth of collagen during the healing process, so option a) is incorrect.
2. A keloid is indeed a firm mass of scar tissue that extends beyond the original wound boundaries, caused by excessive collagen production. This matches option b).
3. A fine, hairline scar is not a keloid. A keloid is raised and thick, so option c) is incorrect.
4. A keloid is not specifically formed due to the premature removal of a wound drain. It is related to the body's healing response, so option d) is incorrect.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify which of the given options are amino acids. Glutamic acid, Aspartic acid, and Glutamine are all amino acids commonly found in proteins. 

Next, I need to determine if Palmitic acid is an amino acid. Palmitic acid is actually a fatty acid, not an amino acid.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Serous drainage is a type of wound drainage that is typically clear or slightly yellow in color. It is a normal part of the healing process and consists mainly of plasma.
2. Option a) states that it contains red blood cells, which would describe sanguineous drainage, not serous.

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. The sex of a child is determined by the combination of sex chromosomes inherited from the parents. Humans have two sex chromosomes: X and Y.
2. The mother always contributes an X chromosome because she has two X chromosomes (XX). The father, who has one X and one Y chromosome (XY), can contribute either an X or a Y chromosome.
3. If the child inherits an X chromosome from the father, the combination is XX, resulting in a female child. If the child inherits a Y chromosome from the father, the combination is XY, resulting in a male child.

Thus, the sex of the child is determined by the single Y chromosome contributed by the father.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze the features of spastic paraplegia. Spastic paraplegia is characterized by increased muscle tone (spasticity) and weakness in the legs, typically due to damage to the upper motor neurons.

Next, I analyze the choices:  
- Glycogenolysis refers to the breakdown of glycogen into glucose.  
- Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate.  
- Lipolysis is the breakdown of lipids into glycerol and fatty acids.  
- Gluconeogenesis is the synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources.  

The correct process is gluconeogenesis. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the safety protocols for blood storage and transfusion. Blood that has been out of refrigeration for too long may no longer be safe for transfusion due to the risk of bacterial growth or degradation of the blood components.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Transfusing the blood (option a) or refrigerating it again (option d) would not be safe practices, as the blood's integrity may already be compromised. Disposing of the blood (option b) without informing the blood bank would not allow for proper tracking and accountability.

Finally, the correct action would be to return the blood to the blood bank (option c) and inform them of the situation, as they are responsible for ensuring the safety and proper handling of blood products.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand what the auscultatory gap is. It refers to a phenomenon during blood pressure measurement where the Korotkoff sounds disappear temporarily and then reappear as the cuff pressure is reduced.

Next, I need to analyze the options:
a) This describes the point where the bladder pressure equals the diastolic pressure, but it does not explain the auscultatory gap.
b) This suggests that Korotkoff sounds are heard continuously between systolic and diastolic phases, which is not correct for the auscultatory gap.
c) This correctly describes the auscultatory gap, where the Korotkoff sounds disappear and then return during phase 2 as the cuff is deflated.
d) This describes a situation where the Korotkoff sounds do not disappear, which is unrelated to the auscultatory gap.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

"To solve this:

1. ""1 in 1000"" means 1 gram of substance is dissolved in 1000 mL of solution. This is equivalent to 1 g/1000 mL or 0.001 g/mL.
2. Converting 0.001 g/mL to milligrams per milliliter (mg/mL), we multiply by 1000 (since 1 g = 1000 mg). This gives 1 mg/mL.
3. Therefore, the strength of Adrenaline 1 in 1000 is equivalent to 1 mg/mL.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the context of the question. In genetics, an allele is a variant form of a gene. When an allele is ""masked,"" it means its effects are not expressed in the presence of another allele. 

Next, I recall that a recessive allele is one whose effects are masked by the presence of a dominant allele in a heterozygous individual.

Finally, I compare the choices. The term ""recessive"" fits the description of an allele that is masked. The other options (redundant, repressed, reclusive) do not apply in this context.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand what hypernatraemic dehydration is. It occurs when there is a higher concentration of sodium in the blood due to a relative deficit of water compared to sodium. 

Next, I analyze the choices:
a) This suggests water intake is less than needed, which aligns with the concept of dehydration and hypernatremia.
b) This suggests excess water intake, which does not fit the condition of hypernatraemia.
c) This refers to blood volume loss due to trauma or burns, which is unrelated to hypernatraemia.
d) This refers to blood volume loss due to surgery, which is also unrelated to hypernatraemia.

Finally, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which option is not associated with an increase in the work of breathing, let's analyze each choice step by step:

1. A rise in respiratory rate (choice a) is typically associated with an increase in the work of breathing because the body is trying to compensate for a need for more oxygen or to expel more carbon dioxide.

2. Noisy breathing (choice b) can indicate airway obstruction or other respiratory issues, which often lead to an increase in the work of breathing.

3. An increase in the use of accessory muscles (choice c) is a clear sign of increased effort in breathing, as these muscles are recruited to assist in ventilation when normal breathing is insufficient.

4. A respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (choice d) is within the normal range for adults and does not indicate an increase in the work of breathing.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which of the options can act as an intracellular buffer to limit pH changes during high glycolysis, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Understand the context of high glycolysis**: During high glycolysis, there is an increased production of lactic acid, which can lower the intracellular pH. A buffer is needed to resist these pH changes.

2. **Evaluate the options**:
   - **Glutamine**: While glutamine is an amino acid involved in various metabolic processes, it is not primarily known for buffering pH changes.
   - **Glucose**: Glucose is the substrate for glycolysis and does not have buffering properties.
   - **Carnosine**: Carnosine is a dipeptide (made of beta-alanine and histidine) that is well-known for its buffering capacity, particularly in muscle cells, where it helps maintain pH during high metabolic activity.
   - **Amylase**: Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into sugars and does not play a role in buffering pH.

3. **Conclusion**: Carnosine is the most appropriate choice as it is specifically known for its role in buffering intracellular pH during conditions like high glycolysis.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the options and understand Addison's Disease. Addison's Disease is a condition caused by insufficient production of hormones (cortisol and aldosterone) by the adrenal glands. 

a) Addison's Disease is not related to prolactin hormone deficiency, so this is incorrect.  
b) Generalized pigmentation is a hallmark symptom of Addison's Disease due to increased ACTH stimulating melanocytes, so this is correct.  
c) Addison's Disease typically causes low blood pressure (hypotension), not hypertension, so this is incorrect.  
d) Diabetes is not a recognized complication of Addison's Disease, so this is incorrect.  

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the signs and symptoms associated with circulatory overload. Circulatory overload occurs when there is an excess of fluid in the circulatory system, leading to increased pressure and strain on the heart and lungs.

Next, I need to evaluate the options:
- Option a includes hypothermia, hypotension, and bradycardia, which are not typical signs of circulatory overload.
- Option b includes hypotension, oliguria, and urticaria, which are more indicative of other conditions like shock or allergic reactions.
- Option c includes shivering, pyrexia, and thirst, which are more related to fever or dehydration.
- Option d includes dyspnoea (difficulty breathing), tachycardia (fast heart rate), and distended neck veins, which are classic signs of circulatory overload due to fluid accumulation and increased venous pressure.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the most likely cause of acute urinary retention, I will evaluate each option step by step:

1. **Haematuria (a)**: While haematuria (blood in the urine) can be associated with urinary tract issues, it is not a direct cause of acute urinary retention. It is more of a symptom rather than a cause.

2. **Bladder outflow obstruction (b)**: This is a common and direct cause of acute urinary retention. Conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men, urethral strictures, or other obstructions can prevent urine from leaving the bladder, leading to retention.

3. **Drinking alcohol (c)**: Alcohol consumption can lead to dehydration or diuresis (increased urine production), but it is not a direct cause of acute urinary retention. It may exacerbate underlying conditions but is not the primary cause.

4. **Kidney stones (d)**: While kidney stones can cause severe pain and sometimes block urine flow, they are more likely to cause pain and haematuria rather than acute urinary retention. They are not the most common cause.

Based on this analysis, the most likely cause of acute urinary retention is **bladder outflow obstruction**.

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. The primary tool for cleaning the mouth should be effective in removing debris and plaque while being gentle on the oral tissues.
2. A small, soft toothbrush is specifically designed for cleaning teeth and gums effectively without causing damage, making it the first choice for oral hygiene.
3. Other options like a gloved finger wrapped in gauze, forceps wrapped in gauze, or a foam stick may be used in specific situations (e.g., for patients with limited mobility or sensitivity), but they are not the first choice for routine oral cleaning.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to identify which drugs among the options are known to enhance gastric motility. Adrenaline is a sympathomimetic drug and does not enhance gastric motility; it may actually reduce it. Ditropan (oxybutynin) is an anticholinergic drug, which typically decreases gastric motility. Erythromycin, an antibiotic, is known to act as a motilin receptor agonist and can enhance gastric motility. Carbemazepine is an anticonvulsant and does not have a role in enhancing gastric motility.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The creatine kinase reaction is known to be reversible, as it facilitates the transfer of a phosphate group between creatine and ATP to form phosphocreatine and ADP, and vice versa. Therefore, option a) is incorrect.

2. The creatine kinase reaction is very fast and plays a critical role in rapidly regenerating ATP during high-intensity, short-duration activities. It is faster than glycolysis, so option b) is incorrect.

3. The creatine kinase reaction does not wait until all ATP is depleted. Instead, it acts as a buffer system to maintain ATP levels during the initial stages of intense activity. Thus, option c) is incorrect.

4. Low pH in the muscle, which occurs during intense exercise due to lactic acid accumulation, can inhibit the creatine kinase reaction. This makes option d) correct.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the ideal location for a stoma to ensure proper function and patient comfort. The stoma should be placed in a location that avoids skin creases, scars, or bony prominences to prevent complications and ensure a good seal for the stoma appliance.

Next, the rectus sheath abdominus is a preferred site because it provides a stable and well-vascularized area, reducing the risk of herniation and other complications.

Finally, the stoma should not be placed too close to the umbilicus, within an abdominal crease, or near the incision site, as these locations can lead to difficulties in appliance fitting and increased risk of complications.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) ""women have evolved a greater muscle mass"" is unlikely because evolutionary changes in muscle mass would take much longer than the recent years in which women's world record performances have improved.

2. Option b) ""women can now run faster than men"" is incorrect because, while women's performances have improved, men still generally hold faster records in most sports.

3. Option c) ""women have started training at an earlier age"" could contribute to improvement, but it is not the primary reason for the rapid improvement in world record performances.

4. Option d) ""more women are now engaged in sport"" is the most plausible explanation. With increased participation, there is a larger pool of talent, better training opportunities, and more competition, leading to improved performances.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify the primary genetic material in humans and most organisms. The genetic material is responsible for storing and transmitting genetic information.  
Next, I know that the primary genetic material is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which contains the instructions for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all living organisms.  
Finally, ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays a role in protein synthesis but is not the primary genetic material, and the other options (dinitronucleic acid and protein) are incorrect.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand what insensible loss refers to. Insensible loss is the loss of water from the body that is not easily measured, such as through evaporation from the skin and respiratory tract.

Next, I will evaluate each option:
a) Pyrexia (fever) increases insensible loss due to increased evaporation from the skin and respiratory tract.
b) Using unhumidified oxygen can increase insensible loss as it dries out the respiratory tract.
c) Excessive weight loss is not directly related to insensible water loss; it is more associated with fat and muscle loss.
d) Diarrhoea is a measurable loss of water and electrolytes, not an insensible loss.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider the symptoms: exhaustion, confusion, and unresponsiveness. These symptoms can indicate a serious condition affecting the body's ability to function properly.  
Next, I analyze the choices. Respiratory failure (a) can lead to insufficient oxygen supply, which might cause confusion and unresponsiveness. Renal failure (c) and cardiac failure (d) can also cause systemic effects, but they are less directly associated with these specific symptoms compared to respiratory failure.  
Finally, I conclude that respiratory failure is the most likely cause of these symptoms.  
The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. FADH2 and NADH+H are electron carriers that donate electrons to the electron transport chain, which generates ATP through oxidative phosphorylation.
2. Each NADH+H molecule typically generates approximately 2.5 ATP, while each FADH2 molecule generates approximately 1.5 ATP.
3. Together, one NADH+H and one FADH2 would generate 2.5 + 1.5 = 4 ATP.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the process of muscle contraction and relaxation. Muscle contraction occurs when a nerve stimulus triggers the release of calcium ions, which bind to troponin, causing a conformational change that uncovers actin binding sites. Myosin heads then bind to actin, leading to contraction.

Next, for muscle relaxation to occur, the nerve stimulus must stop. This cessation leads to the reuptake of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which causes the actin binding sites to be covered again, preventing further interaction between actin and myosin.

Finally, based on this understanding, the correct answer is that muscle relaxation occurs when the nerve stimulus is removed. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to identify what the Golgi tendon organ is. It is a proprioceptive sensory receptor that monitors tension in the muscle.

Next, I need to determine its location. The Golgi tendon organ is found at the junction between the muscle and the tendon.

Finally, I need to match the correct description from the choices provided. The correct description is a proprioceptive sensory receptor found at the junction between muscle and tendon.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand what a pulse is. A pulse is the rhythmic expansion and contraction of an artery as blood is forced through it by the contraction of the heart, specifically the left ventricle. 

Next, I need to determine the correct condition for palpating a pulse. A pulse can only be felt when an artery is close to the surface of the skin because arteries carry blood under high pressure, which creates the palpable pulse.

Finally, I confirm that the correct answer is related to the contraction of the left ventricle and the proximity of an artery to the skin.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify the function of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. It is an enzyme complex that plays a key role in cellular respiration by converting pyruvate into acetyl CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle.

Next, I need to evaluate the choices:
a) The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is not located in the sarcoplasm; it is located in the mitochondrial matrix.
b) This is correct, as the complex catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA.
c) This is incorrect, as the conversion of pyruvate to lactate is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase, not the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
d) This is also incorrect, as the conversion of lactate to pyruvate is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a)** The knee is a ball and socket joint: This is incorrect. The knee is a hinge joint, not a ball and socket joint. It allows flexion and extension, with some degree of rotation.

2. **Option b)** A baker's cyst can sometimes be found anterior to the knee: This is incorrect. A Baker's cyst, also known as a popliteal cyst, is typically found posterior to the knee, in the popliteal fossa.

3. **Option c)** The patellar tap is used to demonstrate an effusion: This is correct. The patellar tap test is a clinical maneuver used to detect the presence of an effusion (excess fluid) in the knee joint.

4. **Option d)** 'Knock knee' deformity is due to bilateral genu varum: This is incorrect. 'Knock knee' deformity is due to genu valgum, not genu varum. Genu varum refers to bow-leggedness.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will consider the purpose and audience of a guide titled ""Your guide to the NHS.""

1. The title ""Your guide to the NHS"" suggests that it is intended to provide information about the NHS in a way that is accessible and understandable.
2. GPs and patient lobby groups are likely to already have a detailed understanding of the NHS, so the guide is less likely to be written for them.
3. Patients admitted to the hospital would need specific information about their care, not a general guide to the NHS.
4. The general public, on the other hand, would benefit from a guide that explains how the NHS works and how to access its services.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate each statement to determine its accuracy:

1. The root value of the biceps reflex is C5, C6. This is correct because the biceps reflex is mediated by the C5 and C6 nerve roots.
2. If no reflex is elicited when you tap a tendon, it is documented as absent. This is also correct, as the absence of a reflex is documented as such in clinical practice.
3. The triceps tendon is struck in the antecubital fossa. This is incorrect because the triceps tendon is struck just above the olecranon process, not in the antecubital fossa.
4. Brisk finger jerks confirm a lower motor neurone lesion. This is incorrect because brisk reflexes are typically associated with upper motor neuron lesions, not lower motor neuron lesions.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the most likely cause of tracheal deviation, I will analyze each option step by step:

1. **A left basal pneumonia**: Pneumonia typically causes consolidation and inflammation in the affected lung, but it does not usually result in significant volume loss or pressure changes that would cause tracheal deviation. This is unlikely to be the correct answer.

2. **A small right pleural effusion**: A small pleural effusion may cause a slight increase in pressure in the pleural space, but it is unlikely to be large enough to cause significant tracheal deviation. This is also unlikely to be the correct answer.

3. **Previous tuberculosis of the right upper lobe**: Tuberculosis can lead to scarring and fibrosis in the affected lung, which can cause volume loss. This volume loss can pull the trachea toward the affected side (in this case, the right side). This is a likely cause of tracheal deviation.

4. **Idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis**: This condition typically causes diffuse fibrosis of both lungs, leading to a more symmetrical reduction in lung volume. It is unlikely to cause significant tracheal deviation to one side. This is less likely to be the correct answer.

Based on the analysis, the most likely cause of tracheal deviation is **previous tuberculosis of the right upper lobe**.

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the transition from anaerobic to aerobic energy systems during maximal dynamic exercise:

1. During the initial seconds of maximal dynamic exercise, the body primarily relies on anaerobic energy systems, such as the ATP-PC system and glycolysis, to provide energy quickly.
2. As the exercise continues, the aerobic energy system gradually becomes more dominant because it is more efficient for sustained energy production, although it takes longer to fully activate.
3. Research indicates that the aerobic system becomes the predominant energy source after approximately 1 to 4 minutes of sustained maximal exercise, depending on the intensity and individual fitness level. However, 4 minutes is generally considered the point where aerobic metabolism is fully dominant.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The contractile process in skeletal muscle is initiated by the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm of the muscle cell.
2. Calcium ions bind to troponin, a regulatory protein on the actin filament. This binding causes a conformational change in the troponin-tropomyosin complex.
3. This conformational change exposes the myosin-binding sites on the actin filament, allowing the myosin heads to attach and initiate the contraction process.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify the signs of phlebitis. Phlebitis is inflammation of a vein, and common signs include swelling, redness, warmth, and pain in the affected area.  
Next, I need to evaluate each option. Swelling (a) and redness (b) are typical signs of phlebitis. Exudate (c), which refers to fluid discharge, is not commonly associated with phlebitis. Cool to the touch (d) is also not a sign of phlebitis, as the area is usually warm due to inflammation.

"First, I need to recall the function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells. It is a specialized type of endoplasmic reticulum that plays a key role in muscle contraction.  
Next, I know that during muscle contraction, the sarcoplasmic reticulum releases ions that are essential for the process. These ions are calcium ions, which bind to troponin and allow the interaction of actin and myosin filaments.  
Finally, since the sarcoplasmic reticulum stores calcium ions for this purpose, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. Neurological observation charts are primarily used to monitor a patient's neurological status, focusing on parameters that assess brain function and consciousness. Common parameters include pupil size and reaction, limb movement, and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS).

2. Among the given options:
   - **Urine output (a)**: This is typically monitored in fluid balance charts, not neurological observation charts.
   - **Temperature (b)**: Temperature is often included in neurological observation charts because changes in body temperature can indicate neurological issues, such as infections or brain injuries.
   - **Central venous pressure (c)**: This is a cardiovascular parameter and is not typically included in neurological observation charts.
   - **Blood glucose (d)**: Blood glucose is monitored in metabolic or diabetic care but is not a standard parameter on neurological observation charts.

3. Based on this analysis, the parameter most likely to be seen on a neurological observation chart is **temperature**.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze the question step by step:

1. The discharge checklist is a critical document that ensures all necessary steps are completed before a patient leaves the hospital. It typically involves healthcare professionals directly responsible for the patient's care.
2. The Department of Health (2004) emphasizes the involvement of key personnel in the discharge process, including the nurse (who provides direct care), the consultant (who oversees the patient's treatment), and the GP (who continues care post-discharge).
3. Based on the options provided, the correct combination of individuals involved in completing the discharge checklist aligns with the nurse, consultant, and GP.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze each option carefully in the context of complications of a large goitre:

1. Option a) ""It causes stridor due to compression of the oesophagus"": Stridor is a high-pitched sound caused by obstruction of the airway, not the oesophagus. Compression of the trachea, not the oesophagus, can lead to stridor. This option is incorrect.

2. Option b) ""Dysphagia is an indication for surgery"": Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) can occur due to compression of the oesophagus by a large goitre. This is a valid indication for surgical intervention. This option is correct.

3. Option c) ""It causes hoarseness due to compression of the trachea"": Hoarseness is typically caused by compression or damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, not the trachea. Compression of the trachea can cause breathing difficulties, not hoarseness. This option is incorrect.

4. Option d) ""It causes a more florid thyrotoxicosis than a smaller goitre"": The size of the goitre does not necessarily correlate with the severity of thyrotoxicosis. This option is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the structure of the heart step by step:

1. The human heart has four chambers: two atria (upper chambers) and two ventricles (lower chambers).
2. The heart also has four valves: the tricuspid valve, pulmonary valve, mitral valve, and aortic valve. These valves ensure unidirectional blood flow through the heart.
3. Combining this information, the heart has four valves and four chambers.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze each option step by step:

1. Option a) ""Only patients over 60 years of age"": This is incorrect because the Early Warning Score (EWS) is not age-specific. It is used to assess any patient who may be at risk of clinical deterioration, regardless of age.

2. Option b) ""Only patients admitted to the Emergency Department"": This is also incorrect because EWS is not limited to patients in the Emergency Department. It is used across various hospital settings to monitor patients' conditions.

3. Option c) ""Only patients who have been on an Intensive care/High dependency unit"": This is incorrect because EWS is not restricted to patients from these units. It is used for a broader range of patients who may be at risk of deterioration.

4. Option d) ""Any patient who is acutely unwell pre-operatively or post-operatively and those who have undergone major surgery"": This is correct because EWS is designed to identify patients who are acutely unwell or at risk of deterioration, including those in the perioperative period or after major surgery.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the purpose of the cuff on a tracheostomy tube. The cuff is an inflatable balloon around the lower end of the tracheostomy tube.

Next, the cuff is primarily used to create a seal within the trachea. This seal helps prevent air from escaping around the tube and reduces the risk of aspiration of saliva or gastric contents into the lungs.

Finally, the other options do not align with the primary purpose of the cuff. It does not directly reduce local oedema, assist with swallowing, or allow the patient to talk.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and they are linked together in a chain to form a protein.
2. The bond that forms between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another amino acid is called a peptide bond. This bond is a type of covalent bond.
3. The other options (hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and glycosidic bonds) are not correct because:
   - Hydrogen bonds are weak interactions, not covalent bonds, and they occur between molecules or within a molecule, not linking amino acids.
   - Ionic bonds involve the transfer of electrons and are not covalent bonds.
   - Glycosidic bonds are covalent bonds but are specific to linking sugar molecules, not amino acids.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the methods listed for assessing clubbing. Clubbing is a physical sign characterized by changes in the nail and finger appearance, often associated with underlying diseases.

Next, I evaluate the reliability of each method. Inspecting the nail-bed angle from above or the side may provide some information, but these methods are subjective and less precise. Assessing the fluctuancy of the nail-bed is not a standard or reliable method for diagnosing clubbing.

Finally, Schamroth's sign, which involves placing the dorsal surfaces of the terminal phalanges of opposite fingers together to check for the presence of a diamond-shaped window, is a widely accepted and reliable clinical test for clubbing.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the term ""gene doping."" Gene doping refers to the use of genetic manipulation techniques to enhance athletic performance. 

Next, I need to evaluate the choices. 
- Option a refers to modifying gene transcription using drugs, which is not the definition of gene doping. 
- Option b correctly describes gene doping as the use of genetic manipulation techniques to enhance performance in sports. 
- Option c refers to masking drug use, which is not the primary purpose of gene doping. 
- Option d refers to modifying a specific gene (myostatin), which is a subset of genetic manipulation but not the general definition of gene doping.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the main uses of the hand. The hand is primarily used for sensory perception (touch), manipulation (grasping or pinching), and interaction with the environment (gripping or holding objects). 

Next, I will compare the options to see which one aligns with these uses. Option a) focuses on sensory actions but lacks manipulation or interaction. Option b) includes sensory and gripping but introduces percussion, which is less general. Option c) focuses on specific actions like tapping or clapping, which are not broad uses. Option d) includes touch (sensory), pinch (manipulation), and grasp (interaction), which are three main uses.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

a) A pulsatile mass is always due to an aortic aneurysm: This is incorrect because while a pulsatile mass in the abdomen is often associated with an aortic aneurysm, it can also be caused by other conditions such as a tortuous aorta or other vascular abnormalities.

b) An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion: This is incorrect because an enlarged kidney is typically resonant to percussion due to its retroperitoneal location and the presence of overlying bowel gas.

c) A large mass arising out of the pelvis which disappears following urethral catheterization is caused by an ovarian cyst: This is incorrect because a mass that disappears after catheterization is more likely to be due to a distended bladder, not an ovarian cyst.

d) An indentible mass is caused by faecal loading of the colon: This is correct because a mass caused by faecal loading in the colon is typically indentible upon palpation.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to recall the categories used in the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The GCS is a neurological scale used to assess a patient's level of consciousness based on three main categories: eye opening, verbal response, and best motor response.

Next, I need to evaluate the given choices. ""Eye opening,"" ""verbal response,"" and ""best motor response"" are indeed categories in the GCS. However, ""pupil response"" is not a category used in the GCS.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze the clinical features step by step:

1. **Mixed mitral valve disease** involves both mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation. The predominance of mitral regurgitation would typically present with features of volume overload, such as a displaced apex beat (due to left ventricular dilation) and a pan-systolic murmur (characteristic of mitral regurgitation).

2. **Mitral stenosis** contributes to a mid-diastolic murmur, which may be short or long depending on the severity of stenosis. However, in cases where mitral regurgitation predominates, the mid-diastolic murmur is usually shorter.

3. **First heart sound**: In mitral regurgitation, the first heart sound is often soft or normal, as opposed to being loud in pure mitral stenosis.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

- **Option a**: Displaced apex beat (suggesting left ventricular dilation), soft first heart sound (consistent with mitral regurgitation), pan-systolic murmur (typical of mitral regurgitation), and short mid-diastolic murmur (suggesting mild mitral stenosis). This combination is most consistent with mixed mitral valve disease with a predominance of mitral regurgitation.

- **Option b**: Irregularly irregular pulse (suggesting atrial fibrillation, common in mitral stenosis), displaced apex beat, ejection systolic murmur (not typical of mitral regurgitation), and short mid-diastolic murmur. The ejection systolic murmur makes this less likely to represent mitral regurgitation.

- **Option c**: Displaced apex beat, normal first heart sound, pan-systolic murmur, and long mid-diastolic murmur. A long mid-diastolic murmur suggests more significant mitral stenosis, making this less likely to represent a predominance of mitral regurgitation.

- **Option d**: Tapping apex beat (suggesting mitral stenosis), loud first heart sound (typical of mitral stenosis), pan-systolic murmur, and long mid-diastolic murmur. This combination is more indicative of mitral stenosis with regurgitation, not a predominance of regurgitation.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the psychological and physiological effects of informing a patient about a painful procedure and pain management. Providing information can help reduce uncertainty and fear, which are major contributors to anxiety.

Next, reducing anxiety can have a direct impact on the perception of pain, as anxiety often amplifies the experience of pain. This means that informed patients are likely to perceive less pain intensity.

Finally, while informing patients may have other benefits, such as improving overall comfort, the primary association is with reduced anxiety and perceived pain intensity.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Glycolysis is the process by which one molecule of glucose is converted into two molecules of pyruvate. During this process, a net gain of ATP occurs.
2. Specifically, glycolysis produces 4 ATP molecules, but 2 ATP molecules are consumed in the initial steps of the pathway. This results in a net gain of 2 ATP molecules.
3. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the net ATP production via substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis. Glycolysis produces 4 ATP molecules in total, but 2 ATP molecules are consumed during the preparatory phase when starting from glucose. This results in a net production of 2 ATP from glucose.

Next, when starting from glycogen, only 1 ATP is consumed in the preparatory phase because glycogen is broken down into glucose-1-phosphate, which is converted to glucose-6-phosphate without using ATP. Therefore, the net ATP production from glycogen is 3 ATP.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze each option carefully to determine its validity:

a) A painful digital examination suggests an anal fissure: Anal fissures are often associated with pain during a digital rectal examination due to the tear in the anal mucosa. This statement is likely true.

b) Bright red blood on the finger usually signifies a caecal lesion: Bright red blood typically indicates bleeding from a lower gastrointestinal source, such as the rectum or anus, rather than a caecal lesion, which is located in the proximal colon. This statement is false.

c) Proctoscopy is of no value in the assessment of rectal bleeding: Proctoscopy is a valuable diagnostic tool for assessing rectal bleeding as it allows direct visualization of the rectum and anal canal. This statement is false.

d) Rectal cancer is the commonest cause of rectal bleeding: While rectal cancer can cause rectal bleeding, it is not the most common cause. Hemorrhoids and anal fissures are more common causes. This statement is false.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Mutations are not always harmful. Some mutations can be neutral or even beneficial, so option a) is incorrect.
2. Mutations can occur spontaneously without the presence of carcinogens, so option b) is incorrect.
3. While some mutations can lead to tumor growth, not all mutations do, so option c) is incorrect.
4. Mutations do occur spontaneously at a low rate due to errors in DNA replication or other natural processes, making option d) correct.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the context of peak flow readings. Peak flow measurements are used to monitor lung function, and consistency in readings is important for accuracy. 

Next, I need to determine the acceptable range of variation between the three readings. The standard guideline is that the three readings should be close to each other to ensure reliability.

Finally, based on standard medical guidelines, the three readings should typically be within 20 litres per minute of each other.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand what a peak flow meter measures. A peak flow meter is a device used to measure the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), which is the maximum speed of air expelled from the lungs during a forceful exhalation.

Next, I need to analyze the choices:
a) The lowest rate of air expelled from the lungs through an open mouth is incorrect because the peak flow meter measures the highest rate, not the lowest.
b) Forced expiratory volume (FEV) is a measure of the amount of air exhaled in a specific time frame, not the peak rate, so this is incorrect.
c) Forced vital capacity (FVC) refers to the total amount of air exhaled after a deep breath, not the peak rate, so this is also incorrect.
d) The highest rate of air expelled from the lungs through an open mouth is correct because it matches the definition of what a peak flow meter measures.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate each option to determine the correct advice regarding paracetamol.

a) Paracetamol can interact with Warfarin, but it does not necessarily interfere with its effectiveness. Instead, prolonged use of paracetamol may increase the risk of bleeding in patients on Warfarin. This is not the most critical point for general patient advice.

b) Paracetamol can be taken on a regular schedule for chronic pain or as required for acute pain. It is not limited to 'as required' use, so this statement is not entirely accurate.

c) Over-the-counter cold remedies often contain paracetamol, and taking additional paracetamol alongside these remedies can lead to accidental overdose. This is an important point for patients to remember.

d) Paracetamol is not contraindicated in patients with pyrexia (fever). In fact, it is commonly used to reduce fever, so this statement is incorrect.

The most accurate and critical advice for patients is option c. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the components of DNA. DNA is composed of nucleotides, which include a sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base (either a purine or pyrimidine). 

Next, purines (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine) are the nitrogenous bases that form part of DNA. Deoxyribose is the sugar component of DNA.

Finally, amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, not DNA. Therefore, amino acids do not form part of DNA.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze each option to determine its correctness.

a) Pale stools and dark urine are characteristic of the jaundice of haemolytic anaemia: This is incorrect because pale stools and dark urine are typically associated with obstructive jaundice, not haemolytic anaemia. In haemolytic anaemia, the urine may be dark due to increased urobilinogen, but stools are not pale.

b) Bilirubin is used by the liver in the synthesis of red blood cells: This is incorrect because bilirubin is a byproduct of red blood cell breakdown, not used in their synthesis.

c) Itching may be a sign of obstructive jaundice: This is correct because obstructive jaundice can lead to the accumulation of bile salts in the skin, causing itching (pruritus).

d) Putting a danger of infection sticker on blood samples from an intravenous drug user with jaundice is optional: This is incorrect because proper labeling of potentially infectious samples is mandatory to ensure safety.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall the nucleotide bases found in RNA. RNA contains the bases Adenine (A), Uracil (U), Guanine (G), and Cytosine (C). 

Next, I need to identify the base that is not found in RNA. Thymine (T) is found in DNA but is replaced by Uracil (U) in RNA.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the characteristics of bronchial breathing step by step:

1. Bronchial breathing is a type of breath sound that is typically heard over areas of lung consolidation or above large airways. It is characterized by a distinct gap between the inspiratory and expiratory phases.
2. In bronchial breathing, the expiratory phase is louder, longer, and more pronounced compared to the inspiratory phase. This is due to the sound being transmitted more clearly through consolidated lung tissue.
3. The gap between expiration and inspiration is a key feature of bronchial breathing, distinguishing it from normal vesicular breath sounds.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the effects of each drug on the brain and its potential to cause acute confusion. Heroin (opiates) can cause sedation and respiratory depression but is less commonly associated with acute confusion. Ecstasy can cause agitation and hyperactivity but is not the most common cause of confusion. Alcohol, especially in cases of intoxication or withdrawal, is a well-known cause of acute confusion, such as in delirium tremens. Cannabis can cause altered perception but is less likely to cause acute confusion compared to alcohol. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the primary functions of the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe is responsible for higher cognitive functions such as decision-making, problem-solving, planning, and controlling voluntary movements.

Next, I analyze the options:
a) The sleep/wake cycle is primarily regulated by the hypothalamus, not the frontal lobe.
b) The ability to draw shapes involves motor skills and spatial awareness, which are more related to the parietal lobe and motor cortex.
c) Understanding others' speech is associated with Wernicke's area, located in the temporal lobe.
d) Visual perception is primarily processed in the occipital lobe.

Based on this analysis, none of the options directly align with the primary functions of the frontal lobe. However, if the question is asking about related functions, the closest might involve motor skills (b). But this is unclear."
"First, I need to identify the correct names of the carpal bones. The carpal bones are eight small bones in the wrist, and their names are scaphoid, lunate, triquetral, pisiform, trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and hamate.  
Next, I will compare the options to find the one that lists all these bones correctly.  
Option a) lists all eight carpal bones correctly: scaphoid, lunate, triquetral, pisiform, trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and hamate.  
Options b), c), and d) include incorrect or unrelated terms such as ""lunar,"" ""radius,"" ""ulna,"" ""proximal phalynx,"" or ""trapezius.""  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to identify the components required for the process of translation. Translation is the process by which proteins are synthesized from mRNA templates.

Next, I know that translation involves mRNA (as the template), tRNA (to bring amino acids), and ribosomes (as the site of protein synthesis).

Finally, I can eliminate the incorrect options:
- Option b includes RNA polymerase, which is involved in transcription, not translation.
- Option c includes DNA and RNA polymerase, which are not directly involved in translation.
- Option d includes chromatin and DNA, which are not part of the translation process.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the term 'coring'. Coring refers to a situation where fragments of the rubber stopper (bung) of a vial are cut out by the needle when withdrawing medication. 

Next, I need to match this definition with the given choices. The correct choice is the one that describes this process accurately.

Finally, I confirm that the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the purpose of a speaking valve, which is to allow air to pass through the vocal cords for speech. This requires airflow through the upper airway.  
Next, I need to ensure that the cuff of the tracheostomy tube is deflated, as an inflated cuff would block airflow to the vocal cords and prevent the speaking valve from functioning properly.  
Finally, I confirm that the correct answer is related to the deflation of the cuff to enable airflow.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a)** IV administration of a drug will delay its action.  
   - This is incorrect because IV administration delivers the drug directly into the bloodstream, leading to rapid onset of action, not a delay.

2. **Option b)** IV administration carries low risk of bacteraemia.  
   - This is incorrect because IV administration involves breaking the skin barrier, which increases the risk of infection and bacteraemia if proper aseptic techniques are not followed.

3. **Option c)** IV administration allows titration of a drug with its desired effect.  
   - This is correct because IV administration allows precise control over the drug dosage and its effects, enabling titration to achieve the desired therapeutic outcome.

4. **Option d)** An intravenous cannula should never be used for both drug and fluid administration.  
   - This is incorrect because, in clinical practice, an IV cannula is often used for both drug and fluid administration, provided proper protocols are followed.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider how temperature affects enzyme activity. Enzymes have an optimal temperature range, and deviations from this range can reduce their activity or denature them. 

Next, I need to consider pH. Enzymes also have an optimal pH range, and changes in pH can alter their structure and function, affecting their activity.

Finally, I need to consider the presence of certain metal ions. Some metal ions can act as cofactors, enhancing enzyme activity, while others can inhibit it.

Since all these factors can affect enzyme activity, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's think step by step:

1. For very high force contractions lasting only 1-2 seconds, the body relies on immediate energy sources that can be quickly accessed without requiring oxygen or complex metabolic pathways.
2. ATP is the primary energy currency of the cell, but the stored ATP in muscles is very limited and only lasts for about 1-2 seconds of maximal effort.
3. After the stored ATP is depleted, the body uses phosphocreatine (also known as creatine phosphate) to rapidly regenerate ATP through a process called creatine phosphorylation. This provides energy for a few more seconds of high-intensity activity.

Thus, the initial energy source for very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds is **ATP stores**.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify which structure is responsible for detecting changes in blood pressure. Baroreceptors are specialized sensory receptors located in the walls of blood vessels, such as the carotid sinus and aortic arch, that detect changes in blood pressure by sensing the stretch of the vessel walls.

Next, chemoreceptors are responsible for detecting changes in chemical composition, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH levels, not blood pressure.

The vasomotor centre and cardiovascular centre are parts of the brainstem that regulate blood pressure and heart rate, but they do not directly detect changes in blood pressure.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the situation where blood clots are blocking a catheter. This is a medical issue that requires proper handling to ensure patient safety.  
Next, I should determine the most appropriate action. Removing the catheter and recatheterizing (option d) is a medical procedure that should only be performed by trained medical staff.  
Finally, the best course of action is to inform the medical staff (option b) so they can assess the situation and take the necessary steps.  

{'sol': 'b'}"
"First, I need to recall that the pH of pure water at standard temperature (25Â°C) is neutral.  
Next, a neutral pH is defined as 7 on the pH scale.  
Finally, since water is neutral, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will consider the standard medical guidelines for the duration a cannula can remain in situ.

1. A cannula is typically used for intravenous access, and its duration in situ depends on the risk of infection and complications.
2. According to standard medical practices, a cannula should generally be replaced every 48 to 72 hours to minimize the risk of phlebitis and infection.
3. Among the given options, the closest and most accurate duration is 48 hours.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand what determines metabolism. Metabolism is the set of life-sustaining chemical reactions in organisms, and it is largely controlled by enzymes, which are proteins.

Next, I need to identify what dictates the formation of these proteins. Proteins are formed based on the instructions encoded in the genetic material (DNA), which determines the sequence of amino acids in the proteins.

Finally, I can conclude that metabolism is determined by the proteins formed as dictated by the genetic material, as these proteins (enzymes) regulate metabolic processes.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall that human somatic cells are diploid, meaning they contain two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent.  
Next, each set contains 23 chromosomes, so the total number of chromosomes in somatic cells is 23 * 2 = 46.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the medical guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis. Antibiotics are typically used prior to procedures to prevent infections in high-risk patients.  
Next, I need to evaluate the options. Patients with an artificial heart valve are at higher risk for endocarditis, a serious infection, and may require antibiotics before procedures like catheterization.  
Finally, I need to confirm that none of the other options align with standard medical practice for antibiotic use prior to catheterization.  

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which feature suggests that a pulsation in the neck is arterial, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **A waggling earlobe**: This is not a recognized feature of arterial pulsation. It is more likely associated with venous pulsations or other unrelated phenomena.

2. **Positive for hepatojugular reflux**: This is a feature of venous pulsations, specifically related to jugular venous pressure (JVP). It does not indicate arterial pulsation.

3. **No variation with posture**: Arterial pulsations are generally unaffected by changes in posture, whereas venous pulsations (like JVP) vary with posture. This is a feature that suggests arterial pulsation.

4. **Pressure in the root of the neck reduces the impulse**: This is a feature of venous pulsations, as applying pressure to the root of the neck can reduce JVP. It does not apply to arterial pulsations.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, I will analyze the choices step by step:

1. Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose into pyruvate, producing ATP and NADH. The rate-limiting enzyme is the one that regulates the speed of the pathway and is highly regulated by feedback mechanisms.
2. Phosphorylase is involved in glycogen breakdown, not glycolysis, so it is not the correct answer.
3. Hexokinase catalyzes the first step of glycolysis, converting glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. While important, it is not the rate-limiting step.
4. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is involved in the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria, which is part of the citric acid cycle, not glycolysis.
5. Phosphofructokinase (PFK) catalyzes the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. This is the rate-limiting and highly regulated step of glycolysis.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate each statement to determine its accuracy:

a) Bleeding haemorrhoids typically cause bright red blood per rectum, not melaena (which is black, tarry stool associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding). This statement is false.

b) Pregnancy is indeed a predisposing factor for haemorrhoids due to increased pressure in the pelvic veins and hormonal changes. This statement is true.

c) Bleeding from first-degree haemorrhoids is usually painless, as they are internal haemorrhoids. This statement is false.

d) Second-degree haemorrhoids prolapse during defecation but can be manually or spontaneously returned to the anal canal. This statement is false.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify what SARMs are. SARMs are Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators, which are compounds that specifically target androgen receptors in the body.

Next, I need to determine whether SARMs are steroid or non-steroid drugs. SARMs are non-steroid drugs, unlike traditional anabolic steroids.

Finally, I need to establish whether SARMs mimic or inhibit the effects of natural steroid hormones. SARMs mimic the effects of natural steroid hormones by selectively activating androgen receptors.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand Î²-oxidation**: Î²-oxidation is the metabolic process by which fatty acids are broken down in the mitochondria to generate acetyl-CoA, NADH, and FADH2. Palmitic acid (C16:0) undergoes Î²-oxidation in a stepwise manner, removing two-carbon units (as acetyl-CoA) per cycle.

2. **Determine the number of acetyl-CoA molecules produced**: Palmitic acid has 16 carbons. Each Î²-oxidation cycle removes 2 carbons as acetyl-CoA. Therefore, 16 carbons Ã· 2 carbons per acetyl-CoA = 8 molecules of acetyl-CoA.

3. **Additional products**: In addition to acetyl-CoA, Î²-oxidation generates reduced cofactors (NADH and FADH2), which are used in the electron transport chain to produce ATP. Water is also produced as a byproduct of oxidative phosphorylation.

4. **Eliminate incorrect options**:
   - Option b) is incorrect because Î²-oxidation does not yield 16 acetyl-CoA molecules; it yields 8.
   - Option c) is incorrect because Î²-oxidation does not directly yield carbon dioxide and water; these are produced later in the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.
   - Option d) is incorrect because Î²-oxidation indirectly involves oxygen, as the reduced cofactors (NADH and FADH2) are oxidized in the electron transport chain, which requires oxygen.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. During high-intensity exercise, such as multiple sprint sports, ATP is rapidly broken down to ADP to provide energy. When ADP accumulates, it can be further degraded through the purine nucleotide cycle.
2. The purine nucleotide cycle involves the conversion of AMP (adenosine monophosphate, derived from ADP) into inosine monophosphate (IMP), releasing ammonia (NH3) as a byproduct. IMP can then be further degraded into hypoxanthine, which can be converted into uric acid.
3. Urea and creatinine are not direct products of ADP degradation. Urea is primarily formed in the liver during protein metabolism, and creatinine is a byproduct of creatine phosphate breakdown in muscles, which is unrelated to ADP degradation.

Thus, the correct products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration during multiple sprint sports are ammonia, hypoxanthine, and uric acid.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. CPR is most effective when the patient is lying flat on their back on a firm surface. This ensures that chest compressions can generate adequate pressure to circulate blood effectively.
2. A semi-recumbent posture or tilting the patient to the left would not allow for proper chest compressions and could hinder the effectiveness of CPR.
3. Raising the legs is not a standard recommendation for CPR and does not contribute to the effectiveness of chest compressions.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the process step by step:

1. Phosphocreatine (PCr) is a high-energy compound used during very high-intensity, short-duration exercise. It provides energy quickly but depletes rapidly.
2. After exercise, the resynthesis of PCr depends on oxygen availability and the recovery process. Studies show that the majority of PCr resynthesis occurs within the first few minutes of recovery.
3. Complete resynthesis of PCr typically takes around 3-5 minutes, with 4 minutes being a commonly cited time for full recovery.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify the type of joint the elbow is. The elbow allows movement in one plane, such as bending and straightening, which is characteristic of a hinge joint.  
Next, I need to confirm that the elbow is a synovial joint, as it has a fluid-filled cavity that facilitates smooth movement.  
Finally, combining these facts, the elbow is classified as a synovial hinge joint.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the definition of a hypertonic solution. A hypertonic solution is one that has a higher concentration of solutes compared to another solution, such as the cytoplasm of a normal human cell. 

Next, I need to evaluate the choices. Option a) correctly describes a hypertonic solution as having a higher concentration of solutes than the normal human cell. Option b) is unrelated to the definition of hypertonic solutions. Option c) describes a hypotonic solution, not a hypertonic one. Option d) is irrelevant to the concept of hypertonic solutions.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Patient's neck muscles should be relaxed**: This is necessary to properly observe the jugular venous pulse, as tense neck muscles can obscure the pulsations.

2. **Timing the pulsation with the radial pulse**: This is important to differentiate between the jugular venous pulse and the carotid pulse, as the jugular venous pulse is not palpable and has a different timing.

3. **Good lighting**: This is essential to clearly visualize the jugular venous pulse, especially since it can be subtle and difficult to see.

4. **Patient lying at 45-degree angle**: This is the standard position for assessing the jugular venous pulse, as it allows for optimal visualization of the pulsations.

Based on this analysis, all options except ""b) Timing the pulsation with the radial pulse"" are necessary for examining the jugular venous pulse. While timing with the radial pulse can be helpful, it is not strictly necessary.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a)** ""Usually remains constant during a race"": This is incorrect because the maximum sustainable power typically decreases as the race progresses due to fatigue and energy depletion.

2. **Option b)** ""Declines with the distance of the race"": This is correct because as the race distance increases, the ability to sustain maximum power output decreases due to factors like energy depletion, muscle fatigue, and reduced glycogen stores.

3. **Option c)** ""Is improved by a high fat diet"": This is incorrect because a high-fat diet does not directly improve maximum sustainable power. Carbohydrates are the primary energy source for high-intensity efforts.

4. **Option d)** ""Is inversely related to muscle glycogen content"": This is incorrect because maximum sustainable power is positively related to muscle glycogen content. Higher glycogen levels allow for better performance.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Fast-twitch fibers are specialized for quick, powerful movements and rely more on anaerobic metabolism. 

1. First, I consider the number of mitochondria. Since fast-twitch fibers rely less on aerobic metabolism, they have a relatively small number of mitochondria compared to slow-twitch fibers.
2. Next, I consider ATPase activity. Fast-twitch fibers are designed for rapid contraction, which requires high ATPase activity to quickly break down ATP for energy.
3. Combining these characteristics, the correct answer is that fast-twitch fibers have a relatively small number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The rate of blood lactate accumulation depends on the balance between how much lactate is being produced and how much is being removed or cleared. This involves both the production of lactate in the muscles and its clearance from the bloodstream.

2. Option a) mentions the rate of muscle lactate production and efflux, which is related to lactate entering the bloodstream but does not fully account for clearance.

3. Option b) focuses solely on anaerobic glycolysis, which is a process that contributes to lactate production but does not address clearance or accumulation.

4. Option c) refers to muscle glucose uptake, which is related to energy metabolism but not directly to lactate accumulation.

5. Option d) correctly identifies that the rate of blood lactate accumulation is determined by the difference between the rate of lactate appearance (production and efflux) and the rate of lactate clearance.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to recall where glycolysis occurs in the cell. Glycolysis is the process of breaking down glucose into pyruvate, and it is the first step in cellular respiration.  
Next, glycolysis does not require organelles like mitochondria or lysosomes, nor does it occur in the nucleus.  
Finally, glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell, where the enzymes responsible for this process are located.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this:

1. ATP and phosphocreatine are the primary energy sources for short, high-intensity activities. They provide immediate energy but are depleted quickly.
2. The energy from these high-energy phosphates is sufficient to sustain maximal exertion for only a very short duration.
3. Research and physiological studies indicate that ATP and phosphocreatine stores can sustain maximal exertion for about 5-10 seconds.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Prosthetic groups are not required by all enzymes in the cell. Some enzymes function without prosthetic groups, so option (a) is incorrect.
2. Prosthetic groups are not loosely bound to enzymes. They are tightly bound, often covalently, so option (b) is incorrect.
3. Prosthetic groups are not sites for allosteric modification. Allosteric sites are separate regulatory sites on the enzyme, so option (c) is incorrect.
4. Prosthetic groups are tightly bound to enzymes and are essential for their activity. This matches the definition of prosthetic groups, so option (d) is correct.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a: Sensory loss is demonstrated in a stocking distribution**  
   Peripheral neuropathy often affects the longest nerves first, leading to sensory loss in a ""stocking"" distribution (starting in the feet and progressing upward). This is a hallmark feature of peripheral neuropathy.

2. **Option b: The tone is increased bilaterally in the legs**  
   Increased tone (spasticity) is typically associated with upper motor neuron lesions, not peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy usually results in reduced tone.

3. **Option c: Reflexes are very brisk with reinforcement**  
   Brisk reflexes are also a feature of upper motor neuron lesions. In peripheral neuropathy, reflexes are usually diminished or absent.

4. **Option d: Weakness is more marked proximally than distally**  
   In peripheral neuropathy, weakness is typically more pronounced distally (e.g., in the hands and feet) rather than proximally.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate each option carefully:

a) Benign essential tremor is a condition characterized by involuntary shaking, often in the hands or arms. Alcohol is known to temporarily improve the tremor in this condition, not worsen it. Therefore, this statement is false.

b) Hemiballismus is a movement disorder characterized by violent, involuntary flinging movements of one side of the body, often due to damage to the subthalamic nucleus, typically from a stroke. It does not cause paralysis of the distal half of the arm. Therefore, this statement is false.

c) A 'milkmaid' grip, which refers to an irregular, squeezing grip, is typically associated with chorea (e.g., in Sydenham's chorea) rather than dystonia. Therefore, this statement is false.

d) Writer's cramp is a specific type of focal dystonia that affects the hand and fingers during writing or similar tasks. This statement is true.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify the recognized causes of chronic cough. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a well-known cause of chronic cough due to acid reflux irritating the throat. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are also a recognized cause, as they can lead to a persistent dry cough in some individuals. Long-term smoking is another common cause of chronic cough due to irritation and damage to the respiratory system.

Next, I need to evaluate sodium valproate. Sodium valproate is primarily used as an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer, and it is not commonly associated with causing chronic cough.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the options provided and their suitability for cleaning the mouth. Hydrogen peroxide can be too harsh and may cause irritation if not diluted properly. Lemon and glycerine swabs can be acidic and may not be ideal for regular cleaning. Water is gentle but may not be as effective in maintaining oral hygiene. Normal saline is a safe and effective option for cleaning the mouth as it is gentle, non-irritating, and helps maintain a balanced pH.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the general principle of pain management following surgery, which aims to provide effective pain relief while minimizing side effects. 

Next, I recognize that giving analgesics only 'as required' (option a) or only when pain scores are high (option d) may lead to periods of inadequate pain control, as pain can escalate before medication takes effect.

Then, I evaluate the use of long-acting drugs twice daily (option c), which may not provide sufficient flexibility to address varying pain levels or breakthrough pain.

Finally, I consider giving drugs regularly with additional 'as required' options for breakthrough pain (option b), which ensures consistent pain control while allowing for adjustments based on individual needs.

The best approach is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the definition of nociceptive pain. Nociceptive pain is typically caused by actual or potential tissue damage, which activates nociceptors (pain receptors) in the body. These nociceptors send signals to the brain through nerve fibers, leading to the perception of pain.

Next, I will evaluate the options:
- Option a describes pain caused by tissue damage and the activation of pain receptors, which aligns with the definition of nociceptive pain.
- Option b refers to pain caused by pressure on nerves, which is more characteristic of neuropathic pain, not nociceptive pain.
- Option c describes a disorder of nerves leading to abnormal pain signals, which also aligns with neuropathic pain.
- Option d refers to pain caused by a central nervous system disorder, which is not related to nociceptive pain.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this:

1. Peak flow readings are used to measure the variability of airflow obstruction, which is a hallmark of asthma. 
2. In asthma, there is often a significant variation in peak flow readings over time, especially in response to triggers or treatment.
3. This variability is not typically seen in conditions like COPD, pneumonia, or tuberculosis, which have different diagnostic criteria.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the purpose of a catheter valve. A catheter valve is used to control the release of urine from a catheter, and it is typically used when the patient has bladder sensation and can manage the valve.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. If the patient is post-operative, they may require continuous drainage to monitor urine output, so a catheter valve might not be suitable. If the patient chooses it, their preference is considered, but it depends on their medical condition. If the patient has bladder sensation, a catheter valve can be used to allow controlled emptying. If urine does not need to be measured, a catheter valve could still be used unless there are other contraindications.

Finally, the most appropriate answer is the situation where continuous drainage is required, such as post-operative care, making a catheter valve unsuitable.

{'sol': 'a'}"
"First, I need to analyze the features and complications of Paget's Disease. Paget's Disease is a chronic disorder that disrupts the normal bone remodeling process, leading to abnormal bone growth and deformities.

1. Bowing of long bones is a characteristic feature of Paget's Disease due to the abnormal bone remodeling and weakening of the bones.
2. Spinal cord compression can occur but is not a common complication; it is rare and usually happens in advanced cases.
3. Heart failure, specifically high-output cardiac failure, is a recognized complication of Paget's Disease due to increased vascularity in the affected bones.
4. Pathological fractures are a known feature of Paget's Disease because the affected bones are weaker and more prone to fractures.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the standard protocol for responding to cardiac arrest. The first action is to ensure that emergency services or the emergency team are called to provide advanced care. This is critical to ensure timely professional intervention.

Next, while waiting for emergency services, CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) should be initiated, starting with chest compressions if the patient is unresponsive and not breathing.

Finally, checking for a DNAR (Do Not Attempt Resuscitation) order is important but should not delay the immediate response to cardiac arrest.

Therefore, the correct first action is to ensure the emergency team/services are called. {'sol': 'a'}"
"First, I need to identify the most urgent medical reason among the choices. Acute urinary retention is a condition where the patient is unable to urinate, which can lead to severe discomfort and potential complications like bladder damage or kidney issues. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention, such as catheterization. 

Next, urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not typically an urgent reason for catheterization unless they are causing complications like retention or obstruction. Incontinence is generally managed with other methods and is not an urgent reason for catheterization. Lastly, catheterizing a patient simply because they asked is not a medically justified or urgent reason.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate each statement based on scientific understanding:

1. Statement a) suggests that increasing protein intake above 3 grams per kg body mass per day will stimulate muscle growth and increase strength. However, research indicates that protein intake beyond a certain threshold (around 1.6-2.2 grams per kg body mass per day for most individuals) does not provide additional benefits for muscle growth or strength.

2. Statement b) states that creatine supplements can increase muscle strength and power. This is supported by extensive research showing that creatine supplementation enhances performance in high-intensity, short-duration activities, such as weightlifting or sprinting.

3. Statement c) claims that amino acid supplements can increase muscle strength and power. While amino acids are essential for muscle repair and growth, there is no strong evidence that supplementation alone directly increases muscle strength or power beyond what is achieved through a balanced diet.

4. Statement d) suggests that muscle damage is induced by shortening contractions. This is incorrect, as muscle damage is primarily caused by eccentric (lengthening) contractions rather than concentric (shortening) contractions.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine who has legal responsibility for a patient's care during hospital admission, stay, and discharge, let's analyze step by step:

1. The named nurse provides day-to-day nursing care but does not have overall legal responsibility for the patient's care.
2. The named consultant is the senior doctor responsible for overseeing the patient's medical care during their hospital stay, including admission, treatment, and discharge.
3. The ward manager oversees the management of the ward and staff but does not have direct legal responsibility for individual patient care.
4. The GP (General Practitioner) is responsible for the patient's care in the community but not during their hospital stay.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider what endurance training primarily focuses on. Endurance training enhances the muscle's ability to sustain prolonged activity, which relies heavily on aerobic metabolism. 

Next, I need to evaluate the choices. Contracting faster (a) is more related to speed and power training, not endurance. Breaking down phosphocreatine (b) is associated with short bursts of energy in anaerobic activities. Generating energy anaerobically (d) is also not the primary focus of endurance training, as it emphasizes aerobic energy systems.

Finally, burning fat and carbohydrate (c) aligns with endurance training, as it improves the muscle's ability to use these fuels efficiently during prolonged exercise.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the neurotransmitter released at the motor endplate. The motor endplate is part of the neuromuscular junction, where the nerve communicates with the muscle. The neurotransmitter involved in this process is acetylcholine.

Next, I need to confirm the role of acetylcholine. When an action potential reaches the motor endplate, acetylcholine is released into the synaptic cleft and binds to receptors on the muscle membrane, initiating muscle contraction.

Finally, I need to evaluate the options. Option a correctly states that acetylcholine is released and traverses the neuromuscular junction. The other options incorrectly describe the process or involve different substances.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the implications of diabetes on a patient's health. Diabetes can lead to complications such as poor wound healing, increased susceptibility to infections, and other systemic effects.

Next, I evaluate the options. Option a) mentions bleeding, but diabetes is not directly associated with an increased likelihood of bleeding. Option b) mentions urinary tract infections (UTIs), which are indeed more common in diabetic patients, especially if their blood sugar is poorly controlled. Option c) mentions clear urine, which is not a typical characteristic associated with diabetes. Option d) mentions catheter encrustation, but diabetes does not necessarily reduce the likelihood of this issue.

Finally, I conclude that the correct answer is b) because diabetic patients with unstable blood sugar levels are more prone to infections, including UTIs. 

{'sol': 'b'}"
"First, I need to understand the term 'passive movements'. Passive movements refer to movements performed on a joint or body part by an external force, such as a therapist, without any active effort or muscle contraction from the individual.

Next, I need to analyze the options. Passive movements are characterized by the absence of resistance from the individual and can involve stretching at the end of the range of motion.

Finally, I compare the options to identify the correct one. The option that describes movement without resistance and stretching at the end of the range is the most accurate.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze the options step by step:

1. A tracheostomy is a surgical procedure that involves creating an opening in the trachea to allow air to bypass an obstruction or assist with breathing.
2. The opening is typically made in the anterior wall of the trachea, as this provides direct access to the airway.
3. The location of the opening is usually below the cricoid cartilage, as this area is anatomically suitable for the procedure and avoids damage to the vocal cords.

Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a)** A low blood pressure (<90mmHg systolic) and a tachycardia (>100/min) are worrying features.  
   - Haematemesis (vomiting blood) can indicate significant blood loss. Low blood pressure and tachycardia are signs of hypovolemic shock, which is a medical emergency. This statement is true.

2. **Option b)** A pulse rate of 80/min in a patient taking Bisoprolol is reassuring.  
   - Bisoprolol is a beta-blocker that slows the heart rate. A pulse rate of 80/min in a patient on Bisoprolol may actually indicate a stress response or underlying issue, as their heart rate is expected to be lower. This statement is false.

3. **Option c)** Abdominal pain is always present.  
   - Haematemesis can occur without abdominal pain, such as in cases of esophageal varices or Mallory-Weiss tears. This statement is false.

4. **Option d)** An alcohol history is not essential.  
   - An alcohol history is crucial, as chronic alcohol use is a risk factor for conditions like esophageal varices and gastritis, which can cause haematemesis. This statement is false.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze each option to determine which is true of rheumatoid arthritis.

1. Rheumatoid factor is present in about 70-80% of rheumatoid arthritis cases, not just 25%, so option a) is incorrect.
2. Rheumatoid arthritis is a polyarthritis (affecting multiple joints), not an oligoarthropathy (affecting a few joints), so option b) is incorrect.
3. Anaemia is indeed a common finding in rheumatoid arthritis due to chronic inflammation and other factors, so option c) is correct.
4. Heberden's nodes are a feature of osteoarthritis, not rheumatoid arthritis, so option d) is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider the accessibility of the internet for people aged over 65. Many older adults may not have regular access to the internet or may not be familiar with its use. 

Next, I need to evaluate the specific statistics regarding internet access for this age group. Studies and surveys often indicate that a smaller percentage of people over 65 have access to or use the internet compared to younger age groups.

Finally, I need to determine which option aligns best with the reasoning above. The correct answer should reflect the limited internet access among people over 65.

{'sol': 'b'}"
"First, I need to identify the correct cause of carpal tunnel syndrome. It is caused by compression of the **median nerve**, not the ulna nerve, so option b is incorrect.

Next, I need to evaluate the symptoms. Carpal tunnel syndrome typically causes pain and tingling in the **lateral three and a half digits** (thumb, index, middle, and half of the ring finger), not the medial three and a half digits, so option c is incorrect.

Then, I need to consider the timing of symptoms. Paraesthesia in carpal tunnel syndrome is usually **worse at night**, not during the day, so option d is incorrect.

Finally, I need to assess whether rheumatoid arthritis can cause carpal tunnel syndrome. Rheumatoid arthritis can lead to inflammation and swelling, which may compress the median nerve in the carpal tunnel, so option a is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this:

1. In one complete turn of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle, two molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) are released as a result of decarboxylation reactions.
2. Additionally, one molecule of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is produced, which is equivalent to one molecule of ATP in terms of energy.
3. The cycle also generates reduced coenzymes (NADH and FADH2), which later contribute to ATP production in the electron transport chain, but these are not directly counted as ATP in the cycle itself.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the definitions of the terms provided in the choices. Extravasation refers to the leakage of a vesicant (irritant) medication or fluid into the surrounding tissues, which can cause tissue damage. Phlebitis is the inflammation of a vein, often due to irritation from the IV catheter or medication. Inflammation is a general response of tissues to injury or infection, characterized by redness, swelling, and pain. Infiltration refers to the leakage of non-vesicant fluid into the surrounding tissues, which typically does not cause tissue damage.

Next, I need to match the description in the question to the correct term. The question specifically mentions ""leakage of vesicant (irritant) medication or fluid into surrounding tissues, causing tissue damage,"" which aligns with the definition of extravasation.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to identify which component in saliva has antibacterial properties.  
Lysozyme is an enzyme known for its ability to break down bacterial cell walls, providing antibacterial action.  
Amylase is an enzyme that helps in the digestion of carbohydrates, not antibacterial.  
Sodium chloride and mucus do not have direct antibacterial properties.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the definition of a genome. The genome refers to the complete set of genetic material in an organism, which includes all of its DNA sequences. 

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a refers to the number of chromosomes, which is not the definition of a genome. Option b refers to the entire DNA sequence of an organism, which matches the definition of a genome. Option c refers to the list of proteins, which is the proteome, not the genome. Option d refers to the DNA sequence of an entire chromosome, which is only part of the genome.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. Fatigue development in the brain is influenced by neurotransmitters that regulate mood, motivation, and arousal. Dopamine and serotonin are two key neurotransmitters involved in these processes.
2. Dopamine is associated with motivation, reward, and motor control, and its alterations can lead to reduced energy and increased fatigue.
3. Serotonin plays a role in mood regulation and sleep-wake cycles, and its dysregulation can also contribute to fatigue.

Considering these points, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the types of muscle fibers. Type I fibers are slow-twitch fibers, which are more resistant to fatigue and are used for endurance activities. Type II fibers are fast-twitch fibers, which are used for short bursts of power and speed but fatigue quickly.

Next, Type II fibers are further divided into Type IIa and Type IIX fibers. Type IIa fibers are intermediate, having both endurance and power characteristics, while Type IIX fibers are the fastest and most powerful but fatigue the quickest.

In all-out exercise like sprinting, the body primarily relies on Type II fibers for explosive power. Among these, Type IIX fibers are the first to fatigue because they are the most powerful but have the least endurance.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the metabolic pathways of lactate. Lactate is produced in muscles during anaerobic glycolysis and can enter the bloodstream.  
Next, I need to determine what happens to lactate in the circulation. Lactate is not converted to urea, nor is it excreted directly by the kidneys. Instead, it is taken up by other tissues, such as the liver, heart, and other muscles.  
Finally, lactate can be oxidized for energy or converted back to glucose in the liver through gluconeogenesis. However, the primary fate is its uptake and oxidation by other tissues.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the most rapid method to resynthesize ATP during exercise, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Phosphocreatine breakdown**: This is the fastest method for ATP resynthesis. The phosphocreatine system provides immediate energy by donating a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP. It is a very rapid process but limited in duration (lasting only a few seconds).

2. **Glycolysis**: This is a slower process compared to phosphocreatine breakdown. Glycolysis involves the breakdown of glucose or glycogen to produce ATP, but it takes more time and is not as immediate as the phosphocreatine system.

3. **Tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle)**: This is part of aerobic metabolism and is much slower than both phosphocreatine breakdown and glycolysis. It requires oxygen and is not suitable for rapid ATP resynthesis during high-intensity exercise.

4. **Glycogenolysis**: This is the process of breaking down glycogen into glucose, which can then enter glycolysis. While it supports ATP production, it is not as rapid as the phosphocreatine system.

Thus, the most rapid method to resynthesize ATP during exercise is **phosphocreatine breakdown**.

{'sol': 'b'}"
"First, I need to evaluate each option carefully:

a) Testing pain with a venepuncture needle is not acceptable because it poses a risk of injury or infection. A safer tool, such as a neurotip or pin, is typically used.

b) Proprioception is not appreciated via the same tracts as light touch. Proprioception and vibration sense are transmitted via the dorsal columns, while light touch is transmitted via both the dorsal columns and the spinothalamic tract.

c) Vibration sense is best tested with a 128 Hz tuning fork, not a 256 Hz tuning fork. The 128 Hz tuning fork is more effective for assessing vibration sense in clinical practice.

d) Impulses for pain do not travel up the dorsal columns; they travel via the spinothalamic tract.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. During intermittent high-intensity exercise, the body relies on glucose as a primary energy source. This can lead to changes in blood glucose concentration depending on the balance between glucose uptake by muscles and glucose release by the liver.

2. Typically, during such exercise, the liver increases glucose output to match the increased demand by muscles. This helps maintain blood glucose levels within a relatively stable range.

3. However, in most cases, blood glucose concentration does not fall significantly or rise dramatically during this type of exercise, as the body has mechanisms to regulate glucose levels effectively.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the most common medical condition that necessitates the formation of a stoma. A stoma is often created to allow waste to bypass a damaged or diseased part of the body.

Next, I analyze the options:
- Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder and does not typically require stoma formation.
- Haemorrhoids are swollen veins in the rectum or anus and are usually treated without the need for a stoma.
- Carcinoma, particularly colorectal cancer, often necessitates stoma formation as part of surgical treatment.
- Bladder instability is a condition that affects urinary control and does not commonly lead to stoma formation.

Finally, based on the analysis, carcinoma is the most common reason for stoma formation. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the purpose of a surgical support. Surgical supports are typically used to provide stability and support to areas that may be weakened or under strain.

Next, I need to evaluate the options:
- Prolapsed stomas (a) involve the stoma protruding excessively, which may not directly benefit from surgical support.
- High output stomas (b) relate to the volume of output, which is not typically managed with surgical support.
- Herniation around the stoma (c) involves a bulge or weakness in the abdominal wall, which can be supported with surgical support.
- Retraction of the stoma (d) involves the stoma sinking below skin level, which is not typically addressed with surgical support.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the appropriate size of a catheter bag for nighttime use, consider the following:

1. Nighttime catheter bags are typically larger than daytime bags to accommodate the longer duration of use and increased urine output during sleep.
2. A 350ml or 500ml bag would likely be too small for overnight use, as they are more suitable for daytime activities.
3. A 1L or 2L bag is more appropriate for nighttime use, with 2L being the standard size for overnight drainage to prevent overflow.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this:

1. Anaerobic metabolism is a process that generates ATP (adenosine triphosphate) without relying on oxygen. This is in contrast to aerobic metabolism, which requires oxygen.
2. The key characteristic of anaerobic metabolism is that it occurs in the absence of oxygen, typically during high-intensity activities when oxygen supply is limited.
3. Among the choices, the correct answer aligns with the definition of anaerobic metabolism as ATP generation without the use of oxygen.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to calculate the total oxygen uptake during the exercise. The athlete's oxygen uptake is 3.0 l/min, and the exercise lasts for 5 minutes. So, the total oxygen uptake is 3.0 l/min Ã 5 min = 15 liters.

Next, I need to convert the oxygen uptake into energy expenditure. On average, 1 liter of oxygen corresponds to approximately 20 kJ of energy. Therefore, the total energy expenditure is 15 liters Ã 20 kJ/liter = 300 kJ.

Finally, I compare the calculated energy expenditure to the given choices. The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will consider the following steps:

1. Pressure damage, such as pressure ulcers, often takes time to become visible after prolonged pressure on the skin. The visibility of damage depends on factors like the duration of pressure, the patient's health, and the affected area.
2. Research and medical guidelines suggest that pressure damage can take up to 72 hours to become visible, even if the pressure was applied for a shorter duration.
3. Based on this information, the most accurate answer is 72 hours.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify what eccrine and apocrine glands are. Both are types of glands found in the human body that are involved in the secretion of substances.  
Next, eccrine glands are responsible for producing sweat and are found all over the body, while apocrine glands are also sweat glands but are located in specific areas like the armpits and groin.  
Finally, since both eccrine and apocrine glands are involved in sweat production, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: Grade 3/5 (MRC scale) represents movement of the arm only when gravity is eliminated.  
   - On the MRC (Medical Research Council) scale, Grade 3/5 indicates that the muscle can move the joint against gravity but not against any added resistance. Movement only when gravity is eliminated corresponds to Grade 2/5.  
   - This statement is **false**.

2. **Option b**: Flexion at the elbow is produced by the triceps muscle.  
   - The triceps muscle is responsible for **extension** at the elbow, not flexion. Flexion at the elbow is primarily produced by the biceps brachii and brachialis muscles.  
   - This statement is **false**.

3. **Option c**: The root value of shoulder abduction is C5.  
   - Shoulder abduction is primarily controlled by the deltoid muscle, which is innervated by the axillary nerve. The root value for this movement is indeed **C5**.  
   - This statement is **true**.

4. **Option d**: Grade 1/5 power represents no movement or muscle contraction.  
   - On the MRC scale, Grade 1/5 indicates a **flicker of muscle contraction** but no visible movement of the joint. No movement or muscle contraction corresponds to Grade 0/5.  
   - This statement is **false**.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to determine the stage of phlebitis based on the symptoms provided. Pain at the IV site, erythema, and swelling are indicative of Stage 2 on the phlebitis scale.  
Next, I need to identify the appropriate action for Stage 2. The correct action is to re-site the cannula to prevent further complications.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the hormone responsible for fluid regulation. Fluid regulation in the body is primarily controlled by the hormone that manages water balance and kidney function.  
Next, I consider the options:  
- Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is known to regulate water retention in the kidneys, helping maintain fluid balance.  
- Insulin regulates blood sugar levels, not fluid balance.  
- Adrenaline is involved in the fight-or-flight response, not fluid regulation.  
- Testosterone is a sex hormone and does not play a role in fluid regulation.  
Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the role of carbohydrates in exercise performance. Carbohydrates are the primary energy source for high-intensity exercise, as they are quickly metabolized to provide energy. 

Next, I need to evaluate the impact of low carbohydrate intake. A low carbohydrate diet can reduce glycogen stores in muscles, which are crucial for sustaining high-intensity exercise. This may impair performance during such activities.

Finally, I need to assess the options. Low carbohydrate intake does not directly affect resting muscle pH (eliminating b) and does not increase reliance on muscle glycogen (eliminating d). It also does not significantly influence performance in short-duration events under 10 minutes (eliminating a). The correct answer is that it may impair high-intensity exercise performance.

{'sol': 'c'}"
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the question step by step:

1. Phosphocreatine (PCr) resynthesis is a process that occurs during recovery from exercise, where PCr stores in the muscle are replenished. This process is dependent on the availability of oxygen because oxygen is required for aerobic metabolism, which provides the energy (ATP) needed for PCr resynthesis.

2. If there is a lack of oxygen, the aerobic metabolism is impaired, and the energy required for PCr resynthesis cannot be adequately produced. This would inhibit the resynthesis of phosphocreatine.

3. The other options (excess of creatine, hyperventilation, or excess of oxygen) do not directly inhibit PCr resynthesis. In fact, hyperventilation or an excess of oxygen would likely enhance recovery by improving oxygen availability.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the process step by step:

1. Transcription is the process by which a segment of DNA is copied into messenger RNA (mRNA). This process occurs in eukaryotic cells.
2. Transcription takes place in the nucleus of the cell because DNA is located in the nucleus, and the enzymes and factors required for transcription operate there.
3. After transcription, the mRNA molecule is processed and then transported out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is translated into a protein on the ribosomes.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Oedema refers to the abnormal accumulation of fluid in tissues, leading to swelling. This fluid is typically outside the blood vessels (extravascular) and within the interstitial spaces.
2. Option a) ""excessive intravascular fluid"" refers to fluid within the blood vessels, which is not the definition of oedema.
3. Option b) ""excessive extravascular fluid"" aligns with the definition of oedema, as it describes fluid accumulation outside the blood vessels.
4. Option c) ""excessive intracranial fluid"" refers to fluid within the skull, which is not specific to oedema but could describe conditions like hydrocephalus.
5. Option d) ""excessive necrotic cells"" refers to dead cells, which is unrelated to oedema.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the purpose of a short-acting bronchodilator. It is designed to quickly relax and open the airways in the lungs.  
Next, I need to evaluate why taking it first would be beneficial. By dilating the airways, it allows other medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids, to reach deeper into the lungs for better effectiveness.  
Finally, I can eliminate the other options as they are unrelated to the function of the bronchodilator. For example, color-coding, temperature, or moisture do not influence the sequence of medication use.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a: It is worse at rest**  
   Intention tremor is not worse at rest. Instead, it occurs during voluntary movements, especially as the individual approaches a target. Resting tremors are more characteristic of Parkinson's Disease.

2. **Option b: It is caused by Parkinson's Disease**  
   Intention tremor is not caused by Parkinson's Disease. Parkinson's Disease is associated with resting tremors, not intention tremors.

3. **Option c: It is indicative of a cerebellar lesion**  
   Intention tremor is indeed indicative of a cerebellar lesion. It occurs due to dysfunction in the cerebellum, which is responsible for coordinating voluntary movements.

4. **Option d: Dyscalculia is a common association**  
   Dyscalculia, a difficulty in learning or comprehending arithmetic, is not commonly associated with intention tremor. This option is incorrect.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the primary mechanism by which glucose is transported into muscle cells. Glucose transport into muscle cells occurs through specific protein transporters.

Next, I recall that GLUT4 is a glucose transporter protein that is responsible for glucose uptake in muscle and fat cells. It is regulated by insulin, which facilitates its translocation to the cell membrane.

Finally, I evaluate the other options. Hexokinase is an enzyme involved in glucose metabolism, not transport. Monocarboxylic acid transporters are involved in transporting molecules like lactate, not glucose. Insulin enhances GLUT4 activity but is not the sole determinant of glucose transport.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze where oxygen is directly used in cellular processes. Oxygen is not directly used in glycolysis, as glycolysis is an anaerobic process.  
Next, oxygen is not directly involved in the conversion of fatty acids to acetyl CoA, as this process occurs in the mitochondria and does not require oxygen directly.  
Oxygen is also not used in glycogenolysis, as this process involves breaking down glycogen into glucose and does not require oxygen.  
Finally, oxygen is used in the electron transport chain, which is indirectly linked to the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle), but it is not directly used in the cycle itself.  

Therefore, none of the options directly involve oxygen usage. However, if the question is asking about processes indirectly linked to oxygen, the tricarboxylic acid cycle is the closest.  

{'sol': 'c'}"
"First, I need to consider the effect of arm position relative to the heart on blood pressure measurement. When the arm is above the level of the heart, gravity causes a reduction in hydrostatic pressure in the blood vessels of the arm. 

Next, this reduction in hydrostatic pressure leads to a lower pressure being measured by the blood pressure cuff. 

Finally, this means that the blood pressure will be underestimated when the arm is above the level of the heart. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: Drugs may be implicated in the causation of gout.  
   - Certain drugs, such as diuretics, can increase uric acid levels and contribute to the development of gout. This statement is true.

2. **Option b**: A history of diarrhoea is not relevant.  
   - This is incorrect because a history of diarrhoea can be relevant, especially in conditions like reactive arthritis, which can follow gastrointestinal infections.

3. **Option c**: Difficulty rising from a chair is diagnostic of polymyalgic rheumatica.  
   - While difficulty rising from a chair can be a symptom of polymyalgia rheumatica, it is not diagnostic on its own. Other conditions, such as muscle weakness or arthritis, can also cause this symptom.

4. **Option d**: Joint stiffness of 5 minutes duration suggests an arthropathy.  
   - Joint stiffness of such short duration is unlikely to suggest an arthropathy. Arthropathies, such as rheumatoid arthritis, typically involve prolonged stiffness, especially in the morning.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, consider the context of the question. Male patients are advised to take their own electric razor to the hospital, which suggests a reason related to hygiene or practicality.  
Next, evaluate the options. While comfort, familiarity, and convenience are valid considerations, the most critical concern in a hospital setting is minimizing risks, particularly the risk of cross-infection.  
Finally, using personal items like an electric razor ensures that the patient avoids sharing equipment that could potentially spread infections.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the organ responsible for secreting insulin. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels.  
Next, I recall that insulin is secreted by the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans, which are located in the pancreas.  
Finally, I confirm that the pancreas is the correct organ responsible for insulin secretion.  

{'sol': 'b'}"
"To ensure a large proportion of the drug reaches the lower airways, I need to consider the mechanics of drug delivery via an inhaler. 

1. Taking lots of small, quick breaths (option a) would not allow the drug to reach the lower airways effectively, as it would primarily stay in the upper airways.
2. Breathing normally (option b) might not generate enough airflow to carry the drug deep into the lungs.
3. Performing the procedure quickly (option c) could lead to improper coordination and less effective drug delivery.
4. Holding the breath at the end of inspiration (option d) allows the drug particles to settle in the lower airways, increasing the effectiveness of the medication.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the purpose of standing or sitting upright during a peak flow rate test. The goal is to measure the maximum speed of air expelled from the lungs, which requires optimal lung expansion.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) mentions ensuring best lung expansion and accuracy, which aligns with the purpose of the test. Option b) focuses on comfort, which is not the primary reason. Option c) is incorrect because the counter on the meter is not dependent on the patient's position. Option d) mentions observing technique, which is secondary to the test's purpose.

Finally, the most logical and accurate reason is to ensure best lung expansion and accuracy of readings.

{'sol': 'a'}"
"First, I need to consider the reasons for performing a tracheostomy. A tracheostomy is a surgical procedure that creates an opening in the trachea to assist with breathing. It is often done when there is a need for long-term ventilation or airway management.

Next, I evaluate the options:
- a) Repairing vocal cords after paralysis is not a typical reason for a tracheostomy.
- b) Aiding swallowing is not a primary purpose of a tracheostomy.
- c) Assisting in weaning patients from a ventilator is a valid reason, as a tracheostomy can provide a more stable airway for patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation.
- d) Performing a tracheostomy prior to neck surgery is not a common or primary reason for the procedure.

Finally, the most appropriate answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. At higher exercise intensities, the body requires energy at a faster rate. Aerobic energy production (which relies on oxygen) is slower compared to anaerobic energy production, which does not require oxygen and can provide energy quickly.
2. Anaerobic energy production becomes the dominant source of energy during high-intensity exercise because it can meet the rapid energy demands, even though it is less efficient than aerobic processes.
3. The TCA cycle and the electron transfer chain are part of aerobic metabolism, which is more prominent during lower-intensity, sustained exercise rather than high-intensity exercise.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the second commonest hospital-acquired infection, I will first consider the most common hospital-acquired infection, which is urinary tract infection (UTI). This is primarily due to the frequent use of catheters in hospitalized patients. 

Next, I will evaluate the other options. Wound infections, also known as surgical site infections (SSIs), are typically the second most common hospital-acquired infection. These occur after surgical procedures and are influenced by factors such as the type of surgery, patient health, and hospital practices.

Upper respiratory tract infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia are less common compared to urinary infections and wound infections.

Therefore, the second commonest hospital-acquired infection is wound infection.

{'sol': 'b'}"
"To determine where phosphocreatine is found in the muscle cell, let's analyze step by step:

1. Phosphocreatine is a high-energy compound that serves as a rapid energy reserve for the regeneration of ATP during muscle contraction. It is primarily involved in the immediate energy system of the cell.
2. The process of ATP regeneration using phosphocreatine occurs in the cytoplasm, where the enzyme creatine kinase catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from phosphocreatine to ADP, forming ATP.
3. Phosphocreatine is not localized to specific organelles like the mitochondria or the sarcolemma but is instead found in the cytoplasm, where it can quickly interact with ADP to produce ATP.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the importance of a patient's self-report of pain. Pain is a subjective experience, and health care staff rely on the patient's description to understand its intensity and nature. 

Next, I need to evaluate the choices. Health care staff may underestimate the intensity of pain because they cannot directly measure it objectively. This makes the patient's self-report crucial for accurate assessment.

Finally, I need to determine which choice aligns best with this reasoning. The correct answer is that health care staff underestimate the intensity of the patient's pain.
