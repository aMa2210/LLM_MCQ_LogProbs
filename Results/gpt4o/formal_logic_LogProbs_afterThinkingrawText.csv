"First, I need to identify the main point or conclusion of the argument. The passage discusses the difficulty of convincing people of the unconscious due to the arrogance of consciousness and its defense mechanisms.

Next, I note that the conclusion is often supported by other statements in the argument. The statement ""Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts"" summarizes the main point.

Finally, I compare the choices to determine which one best represents the conclusion. The correct choice is the one that encapsulates the difficulty of convincing people of the unconscious.

"To solve this, I will break it down step by step:

1. The statement ""David teaches Chris"" means that David is the one doing the teaching, and Chris is the one being taught.
2. In predicate logic, the format Txy means ""x teaches y,"" where x is the teacher and y is the student.
3. Substituting the given variables: d represents David, and c represents Chris. Therefore, the correct representation is Tdc, where David (d) teaches Chris (c).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's break down the proposition step by step:

1. The proposition is: (∃x)[(Ax • Lx) • (∃y)(Hy • Bxy)].
   - This means ""There exists an x such that x is an apartment (Ax) and x is large (Lx), and there exists a y such that y is a house (Hy) and y is bigger than x (Bxy).""

2. Interpreting this step by step:
   - (∃x)(Ax • Lx): There exists an x such that x is an apartment and x is large.
   - (∃y)(Hy • Bxy): There exists a y such that y is a house and y is bigger than x.

3. Combining these two parts:
   - There exists a large apartment (x) such that there exists a house (y) that is bigger than this apartment.

4. Now, match this interpretation with the given choices:
   - a) Some large houses are bigger than some apartments. (Incorrect, as it talks about large houses, not large apartments.)
   - b) Some houses are bigger than all large apartments. (Incorrect, as it doesn't say ""all large apartments."")
   - c) Some large apartments are bigger than some houses. (Incorrect, as it says the opposite of the proposition.)
   - d) Some houses are bigger than some large apartments. (Correct, as it matches the interpretation.)

"To determine the validity of the argument, I will construct a truth table and analyze the premises and conclusion step by step.

1. The argument has two premises:  
   Premise 1: ~G ⊃ H  
   Premise 2: ~H  
   Conclusion: G  

2. I will construct a truth table for all possible truth values of G and H, and evaluate the premises and conclusion.

| G   | H   | ~G  | ~H  | ~G ⊃ H | Conclusion (G) |
|-----|-----|------|------|--------|----------------|
| T   | T   |  F   |  F   |   T    |       T        |
| T   | F   |  F   |  T   |   F    |       T        |
| F   | T   |  T   |  F   |   T    |       F        |
| F   | F   |  T   |  T   |   F    |       F        |

3. To determine validity, the argument is valid if, in every case where the premises are true, the conclusion is also true.  
   - In the second row, Premise 1 (~G ⊃ H) is false, so we do not consider it.  
   - In the fourth row, Premise 2 (~H) is true, but Premise 1 (~G ⊃ H) is false, so we do not consider it.  
   - In the first row, both premises are true, and the conclusion is true.  
   - In the third row, Premise 1 is true, but Premise 2 is false, so we do not consider it.

4. The argument is invalid because there is a counterexample where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. Specifically, this occurs when G is true and H is false.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The formula is (~B • E) ⊃ D. This can be read as ""If (~B • E), then D.""
2. (~B • E) means ""It is not the case that Izzy plays Minecraft, and Ashleigh stops by.""
3. D means ""Russell makes dinner.""
4. Putting it together, the formula translates to: ""If it is not the case that Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by, then Russell makes dinner.""

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's break down the proposition step by step:

1. The proposition is: (∃x)[Hx • (∀y)(Ay ⊃ Bxy)].
   - (∃x) means ""there exists an x.""
   - Hx means ""x is a house.""
   - (∀y)(Ay ⊃ Bxy) means ""for all y, if y is an apartment, then x is bigger than y.""

2. Combining these, the proposition states: ""There exists an x such that x is a house, and for all y, if y is an apartment, then x is bigger than y.""

3. In simpler terms, this means: ""There exists a house that is bigger than every apartment.""

Now, let's evaluate the choices:
a) ""Some houses are smaller than all apartments."" This is incorrect because the proposition states that a house is bigger, not smaller, than all apartments.
b) ""Every house is bigger than every apartment."" This is incorrect because the proposition only states that *some* house is bigger than every apartment, not all houses.
c) ""Some apartment is smaller than every house."" This is incorrect because the proposition focuses on a house being bigger than all apartments, not the reverse.
d) ""Some houses are bigger than every apartment."" This is correct because the proposition explicitly states that there exists a house that is bigger than every apartment.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will construct a truth table for the given argument and analyze its validity step by step.

1. **Identify the components of the argument**:  
   - Premise: `~K ≡ L`  
   - Conclusion: `(K · L) ∨ (K · ~L)`  

2. **Construct the truth table**:  
   - The truth table will include columns for `K`, `L`, `~K`, `~K ≡ L`, `K · L`, `K · ~L`, and `(K · L) ∨ (K · ~L)`.  
   - Evaluate the truth values for each row of the table.

3. **Check validity**:  
   - An argument is valid if, in every case where the premise is true, the conclusion is also true.  
   - If there is a row where the premise is true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and that row provides a counterexample.

Now, let's analyze the truth table:

| K   | L   | ~K  | ~K ≡ L | K · L | K · ~L | (K · L) ∨ (K · ~L) |
|-----|-----|------|--------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| T   | T   |  F   |   F    |   T   |   F    |         T         |
| T   | F   |  F   |   T    |   F   |   T    |         T         |
| F   | T   |  T   |   T    |   F   |   F    |         F         |
| F   | F   |  T   |   F    |   F   |   F    |         F         |

4. **Analyze the table**:  
   - The premise `~K ≡ L` is true in rows 2 and 3.  
   - In row 2, the conclusion `(K · L) ∨ (K · ~L)` is true.  
   - In row 3, the conclusion `(K · L) ∨ (K · ~L)` is false.  

5. **Determine validity**:  
   - Since there is a row (row 3) where the premise is true but the conclusion is false, the argument is **invalid**.  
   - The counterexample occurs when `K = F` and `L = T`.

"To identify the antecedent of the conditional proposition, I need to focus on the part of the statement that comes after ""If"" and before the comma. 

Step 1: The conditional proposition is ""If the university does not increase financial aid, either the president fails to approve it or the board of trustees prevents it.""  
Step 2: The antecedent is the part of the statement that follows ""If,"" which is ""the university does not increase financial aid.""  
Step 3: From the given choices, the correct antecedent matches choice b) ""The university does not increase financial aid.""

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I will analyze the premises step by step to determine which proposition is an immediate consequence:

1. From the premise `~I` and the premise `H ⊃ I`, we know that if `H` were true, then `I` would also be true. However, since `~I` is given, `H` must be false. Therefore, `~H` is an immediate consequence.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The sentence ""Everybody loves Raymond, or not"" can be interpreted as a logical statement that either ""L"" (everybody loves Raymond) is true, or ""not L"" (it is not the case that everybody loves Raymond) is true.
2. In propositional logic, this corresponds to the logical disjunction (OR) of ""L"" and ""~L"" (not L).
3. The correct symbolization of this sentence is therefore ""L ∨ ~L"".

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The statement ""All kings are luckier than all paupers"" means that for every king \(x\) and every pauper \(y\), \(x\) is luckier than \(y\). This can be expressed as \((\forall x)(\forall y)((Kx \land Py) \supset Lxy)\).

2. Now, let's analyze the choices:
   - **a)** \((\forall x)Kx \supset (\forall y)(Py \supset Lxy)\): This suggests that if all \(x\) are kings, then for all \(y\), if \(y\) is a pauper, then \(x\) is luckier than \(y\). This is incorrect because it doesn't properly express the relationship between kings and paupers.
   - **b)** \((\forall x)Kx \supset (\forall y)(Lxy \supset Py)\): This suggests that if all \(x\) are kings, then for all \(y\), if \(x\) is luckier than \(y\), then \(y\) is a pauper. This is also incorrect because it reverses the relationship.
   - **c)** \((\forall x)(\forall y)((Kx \land Py) \supset Lyx)\): This suggests that for all \(x\) and \(y\), if \(x\) is a king and \(y\) is a pauper, then \(y\) is luckier than \(x\). This is the opposite of the intended meaning.
   - **d)** \((\forall x)(Kx \land (\forall y)(Py)) \supset Lxy\): This suggests that if \(x\) is a king and all \(y\) are paupers, then \(x\) is luckier than \(y\). This is incorrect because it doesn't properly generalize the relationship between all kings and all paupers.

3. The correct translation is not explicitly listed in the choices, but the closest correct form is \((\forall x)(\forall y)((Kx \land Py) \supset Lxy)\), which matches the intended meaning.

Therefore, none of the options are correct. However, if forced to choose, the closest match would be **a)**, but it is still not fully accurate.

"To solve this, I will construct the truth tables for both propositions and compare their truth values across all possible truth value combinations of the variables \( M \), \( N \), and \( O \). Then, I will determine the logical relationship between the two propositions.

2. **Step 2**: Evaluate the truth values of each proposition for all combinations of \( M \), \( N \), and \( O \).

   - Premise 2: \( \neg F \supset G \) (If \( \neg F \), then \( G \)).
   - Premise 3: \( \neg G \) (Not \( G \)).

2. From Premise 3 (\( \neg G \)), we know \( G \) is false. Using Premise 2 (\( \neg F \supset G \)), if \( \neg F \) were true, \( G \) would have to be true. But since \( G \) is false (\( \neg G \)), \( \neg F \) must also be false. Therefore, \( F \) is true.

3. Since \( F \) is true, we can conclude \( \neg \neg F \) (double negation of \( F \)) is true.

"To determine the validity of the argument using an indirect truth table, we proceed step by step:

1. **Understand the argument structure**:  
   Premises:  
   - Premise 1: \( E \supset (F \lor \sim G) \)  
   - Premise 2: \( F \supset (\sim E \lor \sim G) \)  
   Conclusion: \( \sim (E \equiv F) \)  

   The argument is valid if the premises being true always lead to the conclusion being true. If we find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.

2. **Analyze the conclusion**:  
   The conclusion \( \sim (E \equiv F) \) means \( E \) and \( F \) do not have the same truth value. In other words, \( E \) and \( F \) must differ (one is true, and the other is false).

3. **Test for counterexamples**:  
   We need to find a situation where both premises are true, but the conclusion is false (i.e., \( E \equiv F \) is true, meaning \( E \) and \( F \) have the same truth value).  
   - Case 1: \( E, F, G \) are all true.  
     - Premise 1: \( E \supset (F \lor \sim G) \): \( T \supset (T \lor \sim T) = T \supset T = T \). True.  
     - Premise 2: \( F \supset (\sim E \lor \sim G) \): \( T \supset (\sim T \lor \sim T) = T \supset F = F \). False.  
     This case does not satisfy both premises being true.  

   - Case 2: \( E \) and \( F \) are true, and \( G \) is false.  
     - Premise 1: \( E \supset (F \lor \sim G) \): \( T \supset (T \lor \sim F) = T \supset T = T \). True.  
     - Premise 2: \( F \supset (\sim E \lor \sim G) \): \( T \supset (\sim T \lor T) = T \supset T = T \). True.  
     - Conclusion: \( \sim (E \equiv F) \): \( \sim (T \equiv T) = \sim T = F \). False.  
     This is a counterexample where both premises are true, but the conclusion is false.  

   - Case 3: \( E, F, G \) are all false.  
     - Premise 1: \( E \supset (F \lor \sim G) \): \( F \supset (F \lor T) = F \supset T = T \). True.  
     - Premise 2: \( F \supset (\sim E \lor \sim G) \): \( F \supset (T \lor T) = F \supset T = T \). True.  
     - Conclusion: \( \sim (E \equiv F) \): \( \sim (F \equiv F) = \sim T = F \). False.  
     This is another counterexample.  

4. **Choose the correct option**:  
   The argument is invalid. The counterexample in Case 2 matches the description in option (c): \( E \) and \( F \) are true, and \( G \) is false.

The correct answer is: {'sol': 'c'}"
"To determine the validity of the argument using an indirect truth table, we proceed step by step:

1. **Understand the argument structure**:  
   Premises:  
   - \( H \equiv (\sim I \lor J) \)  
   - \( H \lor \sim J \)  
   Conclusion:  
   - \( \sim I \)  

   The argument is valid if the conclusion (\( \sim I \)) must be true whenever the premises are true. If we can find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.

2. **Set up a counterexample**:  
   To make the conclusion (\( \sim I \)) false, \( I \) must be true. We now check if the premises can also be true under this condition.  

   - If \( I \) is true, then \( \sim I \) is false.  
   - For \( H \equiv (\sim I \lor J) \) to be true, \( H \) must have the same truth value as \( (\sim I \lor J) \). Since \( \sim I \) is false, \( (\sim I \lor J) \) depends on \( J \). If \( J \) is false, \( (\sim I \lor J) \) is false, and \( H \) must also be false.  
   - For \( H \lor \sim J \) to be true, either \( H \) or \( \sim J \) must be true. If \( H \) is false, \( \sim J \) must be true, which means \( J \) is false.  

   Thus, a counterexample is possible when \( I \) is true, \( H \) is false, and \( J \) is false.

3. **Verify the counterexample**:  
   - \( H \equiv (\sim I \lor J) \): If \( H \) is false, \( (\sim I \lor J) \) is also false. Since \( I \) is true, \( \sim I \) is false, and \( J \) is false, \( (\sim I \lor J) \) is indeed false. This premise holds.  
   - \( H \lor \sim J \): If \( H \) is false and \( J \) is false, \( \sim J \) is true. Thus, \( H \lor \sim J \) is true. This premise also holds.  
   - Conclusion (\( \sim I \)): If \( I \) is true, \( \sim I \) is false. The conclusion does not hold.  

   Therefore, the premises are true, and the conclusion is false, making the argument invalid.

4. **Choose the correct counterexample**:  
   The counterexample occurs when \( I \) is true, \( H \) is false, and \( J \) is false.

2. The predicate logic translation should include:
   - Fx: x is a firefighter.
   - Vy: y is a victim.
   - Dz: z is a danger.
   - Rxyz: x rescues y from z.

3. The correct structure should express that there exists a firefighter (x), a victim (y), and a danger (z) such that the firefighter rescues the victim from the danger. This matches the form: (∃x)(Fx • (∃y)(Vy • (∃z)(Dz • Rxyz))).

"To identify the antecedent of the conditional proposition, we need to carefully analyze the structure of the statement. The proposition is a biconditional statement (""if, and only if""), which means the two parts are equivalent and mutually dependent.

1. The statement is: ""The university raises tuition if, and only if, both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.""
2. In a biconditional statement, there isn't a clear ""antecedent"" in the traditional sense of a conditional (""if-then"") statement because both parts are equivalent. The university raising tuition depends on the governor's approval and the board's recommendation, and vice versa.

2. In predicate logic, ""if \( x \) is a planet, then \( x \) is smaller than Jupiter"" is expressed as \( Px \supset Sxj \).
3. Since this applies to all objects \( x \), we use the universal quantifier \( \forall x \), resulting in \( (\forall x)(Px \supset Sxj) \).

1. The sentence states: ""Pablo will go to the store if, and only if, his brother drives him and pays for gas."" This indicates a biconditional relationship (""if, and only if"") between Pablo going to the store and the condition of his brother driving him and paying for gas.

2. Let:
   - P represent ""Pablo will go to the store.""
   - D represent ""His brother drives him.""
   - G represent ""His brother pays for gas.""

3. The biconditional relationship means that Pablo going to the store (P) is true if, and only if, both D and G are true together. This can be symbolized as **P ≡ (D • G)**.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine whether the set of propositions is consistent, we need to check if there is at least one valuation of truth values for D, E, and F that makes all the propositions true simultaneously. Let's analyze step by step:

1. **Analyze the first proposition, D ≡ E**:  
   This means D and E must have the same truth value. If D is true, E must be true. If D is false, E must be false.

2. **Analyze the second proposition, F ∨ D**:  
   This means either F is true, or D is true, or both are true. At least one of F or D must be true.

3. **Analyze the third proposition, ~E · ~F**:  
   This means both E is false (~E is true) and F is false (~F is true). So, E must be false, and F must be false.

4. **Combine the constraints**:  
   - From D ≡ E, if E is false, then D must also be false.  
   - From F ∨ D, if F is false (from ~E · ~F) and D is false (from D ≡ E), this proposition cannot be true.  

Thus, there is no consistent valuation that satisfies all three propositions simultaneously. The set of propositions is inconsistent.

The correct answer is: {'sol': 'a'}"
"To determine the best symbolization, I need to analyze the sentence and the logical structure of the options.

1. The sentence states that the restaurant serves ""pie or cheesecake or ice cream for dessert."" This indicates a disjunction (logical OR) between the three items: pie (P), cheesecake (C), and ice cream (I).
2. In propositional logic, disjunction is associative, meaning the grouping of terms does not affect the truth value. For example, P ∨ (C ∨ I), (P ∨ C) ∨ I, and P ∨ C ∨ I are logically equivalent.
3. Therefore, all the given options (a, b, and c) represent the same logical meaning. However, option d specifies that both a and b are correct, which is also true.

Thus, the best answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The sentence ""If Beth rides her bike, she gets to work earlier"" is a conditional statement. In propositional logic (PL), a conditional statement is symbolized using the material conditional (⊃), where the antecedent implies the consequent.

2. Here, the antecedent is ""Beth rides her bike,"" which we can symbolize as **B**. The consequent is ""she gets to work earlier,"" which we can symbolize as **W**.

3. Therefore, the correct symbolization of the sentence is **B ⊃ W**.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The statement ""Either Taylor or Eric is a latte boy"" implies a logical disjunction (OR) between Taylor being a latte boy and Eric being a latte boy.
2. In predicate logic, we represent ""Taylor is a latte boy"" as \( Lt \) and ""Eric is a latte boy"" as \( Le \).
3. The logical OR between these two statements is represented as \( Lt \lor Le \).

Thus, the correct translation is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the validity of the argument using an indirect truth table, we proceed step by step:

1. **Understand the argument structure**:  
   Premises:  
   - \( E \supset F \) (If \( E \), then \( F \))  
   - \( G \supset \sim F \) (If \( G \), then not \( F \))  
   Conclusion:  
   - \( \sim G \lor \sim E \) (Not \( G \) or not \( E \))  

   The argument is valid if the conclusion is true in all cases where the premises are true. If we find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.

2. **Set up the truth table**:  
   We need to test the truth values of \( E \), \( F \), and \( G \) to see if there is a counterexample. A counterexample occurs when:  
   - \( E \supset F \) is true,  
   - \( G \supset \sim F \) is true, and  
   - \( \sim G \lor \sim E \) is false.  

   For \( \sim G \lor \sim E \) to be false, both \( G \) and \( E \) must be true.  

3. **Analyze the premises**:  
   - For \( E \supset F \) to be true, either \( E \) is false or \( F \) is true.  
   - For \( G \supset \sim F \) to be true, either \( G \) is false or \( F \) is false.  

4. **Find a counterexample**:  
   Let \( E = \text{true} \), \( F = \text{false} \), and \( G = \text{true} \):  
   - \( E \supset F \): \( \text{true} \supset \text{false} \) is false, so this does not work.  
   - Let’s try \( E = \text{true} \), \( F = \text{true}"
"To determine whether the set of propositions is consistent, we need to check if there is at least one valuation of truth values for the propositions (A, B, C, D) that makes all the given propositions true simultaneously. Let's analyze step by step:

1. **Proposition 1: A ⊃ (~B ∨ C)**  
   This means ""If A is true, then either B is false or C is true.""  
   - If A is false, this proposition is true regardless of the values of B and C.  
   - If A is true, then (~B ∨ C) must be true, meaning either B is false or C is true.

2. **Proposition 2: C ⊃ D**  
   This means ""If C is true, then D must also be true.""  
   - If C is false, this proposition is true regardless of D.  
   - If C is true, then D must also be true.

3. **Proposition 3: A ∨ (B · ~D)**  
   This means ""Either A is true, or both B is true and D is false.""  
   - If A is true, this proposition is true regardless of B and D.  
   - If A is false, then both B must be true and D must be false.

4. **Proposition 4: A ≡ (B ⊃ D)**  
   This means ""A is true if and only if (B ⊃ D) is true.""  
   - (B ⊃ D) means ""If B is true, then D must also be true.""  
   - If A is true, then (B ⊃ D) must also be true.  
   - If A is false, then (B ⊃ D) must also be false.

### Step-by-step analysis of the choices:
- **Choice b: A and D are true, B and C are false.**  
  - Proposition 1: A ⊃ (~B ∨ C) → True ⊃ (~False ∨ False) → True ⊃ True → True.  
  - Proposition 2: C ⊃ D → False ⊃ True → True.  
  - Proposition 3: A ∨ (B · ~D) → True ∨ (False · ~True) → True ∨ False → True.  
  - Proposition 4: A ≡ (B ⊃ D) → True ≡ (False ⊃ True) → True ≡ True → True.  
  All propositions are true, so this set is consistent.

- **Choice c: A, B, and D are true, C is false.**  
  - Proposition 1: A ⊃ (~B ∨ C) → True ⊃ (~True ∨ False) → True ⊃ False → False.  
  This makes Proposition 1 false, so this set is inconsistent.

- **Choice d: C and D are true, A and B are false.**  
  - Proposition 1: A ⊃ (~B ∨ C) → False ⊃ (~False ∨ True) → True.  
  - Proposition 2: C ⊃ D → True ⊃ True → True.  
  - Proposition 3: A ∨ (B · ~D) → False ∨ (False · ~True) → False ∨ False → False.  
  This makes Proposition 3 false, so this set is inconsistent.

### Final Answer:
The set of propositions is consistent, and the consistent valuation is when A and D are true, and B and C are false.

"To determine the validity of the argument, I will construct a truth table step by step and analyze the premises and conclusion.

1. Identify the components of the argument:  
   - Premises:

     (2) \( \sim M \cdot O \)  
   - Conclusion: \( N \)  

2. Construct a truth table with all possible truth values for \( M \), \( N \), and \( O \). Evaluate the premises and conclusion for each combination.

| \( M \) | \( N \) | \( O \) | \( M \lor N \) | \( \sim M \) | \( \sim M \cdot O \) | Conclusion: \( N \) |
|--------|--------|--------|----------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------------|

3. Analyze the truth table:  
   - The argument is valid if, in every row where all premises are true, the conclusion is also true.  
   - Premise (1): \( M \lor N \)  
   - Premise (2): \( \sim M \cdot O \)  
   - Conclusion: \( N \)  

   Check rows where both premises are true:  
   - Row 5: \( M \lor N = T \), \( \sim M \cdot O = T \), and \( N = T \) (Conclusion holds).  
   - Row 7: \( M \lor N = F \), so the premises are not both true.  

   In all cases where the premises are true, the conclusion does not always hold.  

4. Counterexample:  
   - Row 3: \( M = T \), \( N = F \), \( O = T \).  
     - \( M \lor N = T \) (Premise 1 is true).  
     - \( \sim M \cdot O = F \) (Premise 2 is false).  
     - \( N = F \) (Conclusion is false).  

Thus, the argument is invalid. The counterexample is when \( M \) is true, \( O \) is true, and \( N \) is false.

"To determine the validity of the argument using an indirect truth table, we proceed step by step:

1. **Understand the argument structure**:  
   Premises:  
   - Premise 1: \( P \supset (Q \lor R) \)  
   - Premise 2: \( (Q \cdot S) \supset \sim P \)  
   - Premise 3: \( \sim (\sim Q \lor R) \)  
   Conclusion: \( \sim P \)  

2. **Assume the argument is invalid**:  
   If the argument is invalid, there must be a counterexample where all the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. This means \( \sim P \) (the conclusion) is false, so \( P \) must be true.

3. **Assign truth values to test the premises**:  
   - If \( P \) is true, then \( P \supset (Q \lor R) \) requires \( Q \lor R \) to be true (since a true antecedent implies the consequent must also be true).  
   - For \( (Q \cdot S) \supset \sim P \), since \( P \) is true, \( \sim P \) is false. This means \( Q \cdot S \) must be false (to make the conditional true).  
   - For \( \sim (\sim Q \lor R) \), this simplifies to \( Q \cdot \sim R \) (since \( \sim (\sim Q \lor R) \) is equivalent to \( Q \cdot \sim R \)).

4. **Analyze the counterexamples**:  
   - From \( Q \cdot S \) being false, either \( Q \) is false or \( S \) is false.  
   - From \( Q \cdot \sim R \), \( Q \) must be true and \( R \) must be false.  
   - Combining these, \( S \) must be false (since \( Q \) is true).  

5. **Check the options**:  
   - Option (a): The argument is valid. This is incorrect because we found a counterexample.  
   - Option (b): Counterexample when \( P, Q, R, \) and \( S \) are all true. This is incorrect because \( R \) and \( S \) cannot both be true.  
   - Option (c): Counterexample when \( P \) and \( Q \) are true, and \( R \) and \( S \) are false. This works because it satisfies all premises while making the conclusion false.  
   - Option (d): Counterexample when \( P, R, \) and \( S \) are true, and \( Q \) is false. This is incorrect because \( Q \) must be true for the premises to hold.

2. Now, let's analyze the options:
   - **Option a**: \( \forall x (Fx \rightarrow \forall y (Jy \rightarrow Sxy)) \). This says that if \( x \) is a fruit, then for all \( y \), if \( y \) is a jellybean, then \( x \) is sweeter than \( y \). This is incorrect because it reverses the relationship between jellybeans and fruits.
   - **Option b**: \( \forall x \forall y ((Fx \land Jy) \land Sxy) \). This says that for all \( x \) and \( y \), if \( x \) is a fruit and \( y \) is a jellybean, then \( x \) is sweeter than \( y \). This is incorrect because it does not properly express the universal relationship.
   - **Option c**: \( \forall x \forall y (Sxy \rightarrow (Fy \land Jx)) \). This says that if \( x \) is sweeter than \( y \), then \( y \) is a fruit and \( x \) is a jellybean. This is incorrect because it reverses the implication.
   - **Option d**: \( \forall x (Jx \rightarrow \forall y (Fy \rightarrow Sxy)) \). This says that if \( x \) is a jellybean, then for all \( y \), if \( y \) is a fruit, then \( x \) is sweeter than \( y \). This correctly captures the intended meaning.

   - \( C \cdot \sim D \): This means ""\( C \) and not \( D \)"".

"To determine whether the argument is valid using an indirect truth table, we will assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, and then check for any contradictions. If no contradictions arise, the argument is invalid, and we will identify a counterexample.

### Step 1: Analyze the premises and conclusion
1. Premises:
   - (T · ~U) ⊃ ~W
   - ~W ⊃ X
   - ~Z ⊃ W
   - ~(X · Z)
2. Conclusion:
   - T ⊃ U

To test validity, assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false. If the conclusion is false, then T is true and U is false.

### Step 2: Assign truth values based on the assumption
- T = true (T)
- U = false (F)
- Conclusion (T ⊃ U) is false because T is true and U is false.
- Use these values to evaluate the premises and check for consistency.

### Step 3: Evaluate the premises
1. **(T · ~U) ⊃ ~W**:
   - T = true, ~U = true (since U = false), so (T · ~U) = true.
   - For this premise to be true, ~W must also be true (because if the antecedent is true, the consequent must be true).
   - Therefore, W = false.

2. **~W ⊃ X**:
   - ~W = true (since W = false).
   - For this premise to be true, X must be true.

3. **~Z ⊃ W**:
   - W = false, so for this premise to be true, ~Z must be false.
   - Therefore, Z = true.

4. **~(X · Z)**:
   - X = true and Z = true, so (X · Z) = true.
   - Therefore, ~(X · Z) = false.

### Step 4: Check for consistency
- We assumed the premises are true, but the fourth premise (~(X · Z)) is false. This creates a contradiction, so the argument is invalid.
- Now, identify a counterexample where all premises are true, and the conclusion is false.

### Step 5: Counterexample
From the truth values:
- T = true, U = false, W = false, X = true, Z = true.
This matches **choice b**.

   - ""Cecilia breaks my heart"" can be represented as \( Bc \).
   - ""Maria is a problem"" can be represented as \( Pm \).
   - ""Maria is a girl"" can be represented as \( Gm \).
   - ""Maria is either a problem or a girl"" translates to \( Pm \lor Gm \) (logical OR).

2. The phrase ""if, and only if"" corresponds to a biconditional (\( \equiv \)) in predicate logic. This means that \( Bc \) is true if, and only if, \( Pm \lor Gm \) is true.

3. Therefore, the correct translation is \( Bc \equiv (Pm \lor Gm) \).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this:

1. The statement ""If Delilah is in New York City, then Juana is in Bogota or Layla is in San Juan"" is a conditional statement. In predicate logic, ""if...then..."" is represented by the material implication symbol (⊃).
2. ""Delilah is in New York City"" can be represented as \( Nd \).
3. ""Juana is in Bogota or Layla is in San Juan"" can be represented as \( Bj ∨ Sl \), where \( ∨ \) represents ""or.""
4. Combining these, the correct translation is \( Nd ⊃ (Bj ∨ Sl) \).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will break down the formula step by step:

1. The formula is: ~(A ⊃ B) • (B ⊃ ~E).  
   - The first part, ~(A ⊃ B), means ""It is not the case that A entails B"" or ""It is not true that if Marina reads a Percy Jackson book, then Izzy plays Minecraft.""
   - The second part, (B ⊃ ~E), means ""If B, then ~E"" or ""If Izzy plays Minecraft, then Ashleigh does not stop by.""

2. Combining these two parts with ""•"" (and), the formula translates to:  
   ""It is not the case that Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book entails that Izzy plays Minecraft, and if Izzy plays Minecraft, then Ashleigh does not stop by.""

3. Now, I will match this translation with the given choices:  
   - a) ""It's not the case that Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book entails that Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy's playing Minecraft does entail that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.""  
     This matches the formula exactly.  
   - b), c), and d) do not match the formula as they misinterpret the logical structure.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the validity of the argument using an indirect truth table, we proceed step by step:

1. **Understand the argument structure**:  
   Premises:  
   - (A ∨ B) ⊃ C  
   - C ⊃ ~D  
   Conclusion:  
   - D ⊃ A  

2. **Set up a counterexample**:  
   A counterexample occurs when all premises are true, but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (D ⊃ A) to be false, D must be true, and A must be false.

3. **Analyze the premises under these conditions**:  
   - If A is false and D is true, then for (A ∨ B) ⊃ C to be true, we need to ensure that either (A ∨ B) is false or C is true. Since A is false, (A ∨ B) depends on B. If B is true, then (A ∨ B) is true, so C must also be true for the premise to hold.  
   - For C ⊃ ~D to be true, if C is true, then ~D must also be true. However, since D is true, this forces C to be false.  

4. **Check for consistency**:  
   From the above, we see a contradiction: C must be both true (from the first premise) and false (from the second premise). Therefore, the premises cannot all be true under these conditions, and no counterexample exists.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   Since no counterexample can be found where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument is valid.

The correct answer is: {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I will analyze the given predicate logic statements and their English interpretations step by step.

1. The first statement is ""Dh ⊃ ~Pt"". This means ""If my headache is a dualist state, then your tickle is not a physical state.""
2. The second statement is ""(∀x)Px ∨ (∀x)Mx"". This means ""Either everything is physical or everything is mental.""
3. The third statement is ""~Mb"". This means ""My broken toe is not a mental state.""
4. The conclusion is ""/ ~Dh"", which means ""My headache is not a dualist state.""

Now, I will compare the given choices to find the best match for these interpretations.

- Option a) states: ""If my headache is dualist state, then your tickle is a physical state."" This contradicts the first statement, which says ""your tickle is not a physical state."" So, option a) is incorrect.
- Option b) states: ""If my headache is dualist state, then your tickle is not a physical state."" This matches the first statement. It also correctly interprets the second and third statements. So, option b) is a possible solution.
- Option c) states: ""If everything is physical then everything is mental."" This misinterprets the second statement, which says ""Either everything is physical or everything is mental."" So, option c) is incorrect.
- Option d) states: ""Everything is either physical or mental."" This matches the second statement. However, the first statement is misinterpreted as ""your tickle is not a physical state,"" which is already covered in option b). Option d) is redundant and less precise.

Therefore, the best interpretation is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. From the first premise, \( A \supset (B \cdot C) \), we know that if \( A \) is true, then \( B \cdot C \) (both \( B \) and \( C \)) must also be true.
2. From the second premise, \( \sim(B \cdot C) \), we know that \( B \cdot C \) is false, meaning at least one of \( B \) or \( C \) is false.
3. Combining the first two premises, since \( B \cdot C \) is false, \( A \) cannot be true (because if \( A \) were true, \( B \cdot C \) would have to be true). Therefore, \( \sim A \) must be true.

Thus, the immediate consequence is \( \sim A \).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I will analyze the premises step by step to determine which proposition is an immediate consequence.

1. The first premise is \((N \supset \sim O) \supset (O \vee Q)\). This means that if \(N \supset \sim O\) is true, then \(O \vee Q\) must also be true.
2. The second premise is \(P \supset (N \supset \sim O)\). This means that if \(P\) is true, then \(N \supset \sim O\) must also be true.
3. The third premise is \(N \supset P\). This means that if \(N\) is true, then \(P\) must also be true.

Now, I need to determine which of the given choices is an immediate consequence of these premises:
- \(a) P\)
- \(b) N \supset \sim O\)
- \(c) O \vee Q\)
- \(d) \sim P\)

By analyzing the premises:
- From the third premise (\(N \supset P\)), if \(N\) is true, then \(P\) must also be true.
- From the second premise (\(P \supset (N \supset \sim O)\)), if \(P\) is true, then \(N \supset \sim O\) must also be true.
- From the first premise (\((N \supset \sim O) \supset (O \vee Q)\)), if \(N \supset \sim O\) is true, then \(O \vee Q\) must also be true.

Thus, the immediate consequence of the premises is \(O \vee Q\).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this step by step:

1. The statement ""Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter"" means that it is not true that Earth (e) is bigger than Jupiter (j).
2. In predicate logic, ""x is bigger than y"" is represented as Bxy. Therefore, ""Earth is bigger than Jupiter"" would be represented as Bej.
3. To express ""Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter,"" we negate the predicate Bej, which becomes ~Bej.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To identify the antecedent of the conditional proposition, I need to analyze the structure of the statement. The proposition states: ""The Bees winning their first game is necessary for either the Aardvarks or the Chipmunks not winning their first game."" 

Step 1: In a conditional statement, the antecedent is the condition that must be true for the consequent to follow. Here, the phrase ""is necessary for"" indicates that the consequent is ""either the Aardvarks or the Chipmunks not winning their first game.""

Step 2: The antecedent is the condition that ensures the consequent. In this case, the antecedent is ""The Bees win their first game,"" as it is the condition required for the consequent to hold.

Step 3: Therefore, the antecedent of the conditional proposition is ""The Bees win their first game.""

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To identify the antecedent of the conditional proposition, I need to analyze the structure of the statement. The proposition is: ""The Bees win their first game only if either the Aardvarks or the Chipmunks do not win their first games.""

1. In a conditional statement of the form ""P only if Q,"" the antecedent is ""P"" and the consequent is ""Q."" Here, ""The Bees win their first game"" is the antecedent, and ""either the Aardvarks or the Chipmunks do not win their first games"" is the consequent.

2. The antecedent is the part of the statement that comes before the ""only if."" In this case, it is ""The Bees win their first game.""

3. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The statement ""Some athletes don't get injured"" means there exists at least one athlete who does not get injured.
2. In predicate logic, ""Some"" is represented by the existential quantifier (∃x), and ""athletes"" can be represented by a predicate A(x), where x is an athlete.
3. ""Don't get injured"" can be represented by the negation of the predicate I(x), where I(x) means ""x gets injured.""
4. Combining these, the correct translation is (∃x)(A(x) • ~I(x)), which states that there exists an x such that x is an athlete and x does not get injured.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I will construct a truth table for the propositions \( I \equiv \sim H \) and \( \sim(\sim I \equiv H) \), and analyze their logical relationships step by step.

1. **Step 1: Define the truth table structure.**  
   The truth table will include columns for \( H \), \( I \), \( \sim H \), \( \sim I \), \( I \equiv \sim H \), \( \sim I \equiv H \), and \( \sim(\sim I \equiv H) \).  
   This will allow us to evaluate the truth values of both propositions for all possible truth values of \( H \) and \( I \).

2. **Step 2: Fill in the truth table.**  
   For each combination of \( H \) and \( I \) (4 combinations in total), calculate the truth values of \( \sim H \), \( \sim I \), \( I \equiv \sim H \), \( \sim I \equiv H \), and \( \sim(\sim I \equiv H) \).  
   Then compare the truth values of \( I \equiv \sim H \) and \( \sim(\sim I \equiv H) \).

3. **Step 3: Analyze the results.**  
   Compare the truth values of the two propositions across all rows. If they are always the same, the propositions are logically equivalent. If they are always opposite, they are contradictory. If neither, check whether there is at least one row where both are true (consistent) or no such row (inconsistent).

Now, let's construct the truth table:

| \( H \) | \( I \) | \( \sim H \) | \( \sim I \) | \( I \equiv \sim H \) | \( \sim I \equiv H \) | \( \sim(\sim I \equiv H) \) |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
|   T    |   T    |      F      |      F      |          F            |          F          |            T             |
|   T    |   F    |      F      |      T      |          T            |          T          |            F             |
|   F    |   T    |      T      |      F      |          T            |          F          |            T             |
|   F    |   F    |      T      |      T      |          F            |          T          |            F             |

4. **Step 4: Compare the columns for \( I \equiv \sim H \) and \( \sim(\sim I \equiv H) \).**  
   - In Row 1, \( I \equiv \sim H = F \) and \( \sim(\sim I \equiv H) = T \).  
   - In Row 2, \( I \equiv \sim H = T \) and \( \sim(\sim I \equiv H) = F \).  
   - In Row 3, \( I \equiv \sim H = T \) and \( \sim(\sim I \equiv H) = T \).  
   - In Row 4, \( I \equiv \sim H = F \) and \( \sim(\sim I \equiv H) = F \).  

   The truth values are not always the same (not logically equivalent) and not always opposite (not contradictory). However, there are rows where both are true (Row 3), so the propositions are **consistent**.

**Final Answer:** {'sol': 'c'}"
"To determine whether the set of propositions is consistent, we will use an indirect truth table. A set of propositions is consistent if there is at least one valuation of truth values for the variables that makes all the propositions true simultaneously.

### Step 1: Analyze the propositions
1. **(T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U)**: This means ""If T implies U, then W implies U.""
2. **T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X)**: This means ""If T, then it is not the case that U implies X.""
3. **(T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W**: This means ""If T implies not X, then W.""

### Step 2: Test the given valuations
We will test the given valuations to see if they make all three propositions true.

#### Option b: U, W, and X are true, and T is false
- **(T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U)**:
  - T is false, so T ⊃ U is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).
  - W ⊃ U: W is true, and U is true, so W ⊃ U is true.
  - (T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U): True ⊃ True is true.

- **T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X)**:
  - T is false, so T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X) is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).

- **(T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W**:
  - T is false, so T ⊃ ~X is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).
  - (T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W: True ⊃ True is true.

All three propositions are true under this valuation. Therefore, the set is consistent under this valuation.

#### Option c: W and X are true, and T and U are false
- **(T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U)**:
  - T is false, so T ⊃ U is true.
  - W ⊃ U: W is true, but U is false, so W ⊃ U is false.
  - (T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U): True ⊃ False is false.

Since one of the propositions is false, this valuation is not consistent.

#### Option d: T and U are true, and W and X are false
- **(T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U)**:
  - T is true, and U is true, so T ⊃ U is true.
  - W ⊃ U: W is false, and U is true, so W ⊃ U is true.
  - (T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U): True ⊃ True is true.

- **T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X)**:
  - T is true, and U ⊃ X: U is true, and X is false, so U ⊃ X is false.
  - ~(U ⊃ X): The negation of false is true.
  - T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X): True ⊃ True is true.

- **(T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W**:
  - T is true, and X is false, so T ⊃ ~X is true.
  - (T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W: True ⊃ False is false.

Since one of the propositions is false, this valuation is not consistent.

### Step 3: Conclusion
The only consistent valuation is **option b**, where U, W, and X are true, and T is false.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The statement ""Caroline is sweet if, and only if, Janet is engaged to Brad"" indicates a biconditional relationship. This means that Caroline being sweet (S) is true if and only if Janet being engaged to Brad (E) is true.

2. In predicate logic, ""if and only if"" is represented by the biconditional operator (≡).

3. The correct symbols for ""Caroline is sweet"" and ""Janet is engaged to Brad"" should match the choices provided. Based on the options, ""Sc"" (Caroline is sweet) and ""Ej"" (Janet is engaged to Brad) are the correct representations.

4. Therefore, the correct translation is ""Sc ≡ Ej.""

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's break the sentence into parts and analyze it step by step:

1. The sentence begins with ""Either England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture."" This means that if England imports beef (E), then France subsidizes agriculture (F). In propositional logic, this is symbolized as \( E \supset F \).

2. The second part of the sentence is ""or China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds."" The phrase ""when and only when"" indicates a biconditional relationship (\( \equiv \)) between China not promoting human rights (\( \sim C \)) and South Africa supplying diamonds (\( S \)). This part is symbolized as \( \sim C \equiv S \).

3. Combining these two parts with ""or,"" we get \( (E \supset F) \lor (\sim C \equiv S) \).

4. Now, we compare this with the given choices:
   - a) \( (E \supset F) \lor (\sim C \supset S) \): Incorrect, as the second part uses a conditional (\( \supset \)) instead of a biconditional (\( \equiv \)).
   - b) \( (F \supset E) \lor (S \supset \sim C) \): Incorrect, as the first part reverses the conditional, and the second part uses a conditional instead of a biconditional.
   - c) \( (E \supset F) \lor \sim (S \equiv C) \): Incorrect, as the second part negates the biconditional, which is not in the original sentence.
   - d) \( (E \supset F) \lor (\sim C \equiv S) \): Correct, as it matches the logical structure of the sentence.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will break down the formula step by step:

2. (~A ∨ ~B) means ""Either Marina does not read a Percy Jackson book (~A) or Izzy does not play Minecraft (~B).""
3. The entire formula (~A ∨ ~B) ⊃ C means ""If either Marina does not read a Percy Jackson book or Izzy does not play Minecraft, then Emily stops working.""

Now, I will match this interpretation with the given choices:
- a) ""If neither Marina reads a Percy Jackson book nor Izzy plays Minecraft, then Emily stops working."" This is incorrect because it implies both ~A and ~B, not ~A ∨ ~B.
- b) ""If it's not the case that both Marina reads a Percy Jackson book and Izzy plays Minecraft, then Emily stops working."" This is correct because ""not both"" is equivalent to ~A ∨ ~B.
- c) ""Either Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft entails that Emily stops working."" This is incorrect because it reverses the logical relationship (entailment is not the same as implication).
- d) ""Emily stopping working is a sufficient condition for either Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft."" This is incorrect because it reverses the direction of the implication.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To identify the conclusion of the argument, I need to determine the main point that the author is trying to convey, which is supported by the other statements.

1. The first statement introduces the idea that predicate variables exist and their values are attributes. This seems to be a premise rather than the conclusion.
2. The second statement explains that predicates are wanted in all sentences, regardless of attributes. This also appears to be a supporting premise.
3. The third statement mentions the dummy predicate 'F' being used for expository purposes. This is another supporting detail.
4. The fourth statement provides a recommendation or main point about clarity when quantifying over attributes, emphasizing the use of recognizable variables and distinctive names. This appears to be the conclusion, as it ties together the preceding points and provides a directive.

Therefore, the conclusion is: ""If we are going to quantify over attributes and refer to them, then clarity is served by using recognizable variables and distinctive names for the purposes, and not mixing these up with the predicates.""

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The formula ""~C ∨ D"" translates to ""not C or D"" in propositional logic. This means either ""Emily doesn't stop working"" (~C) or ""Russell makes dinner"" (D) is true.
2. In natural language, this can be interpreted as ""Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner."" This is because the condition ""~C ∨ D"" implies that if Emily doesn't stop working (~C), it is because Russell makes dinner (D).

3. Here, ""Sheena"" is the individual, so it should be represented by a lowercase letter, such as ""s."" The property ""is a punk rocker"" is a predicate, so it should be represented by an uppercase letter, such as ""P.""
4. The correct representation is ""Ps,"" where ""P"" is the predicate (punk rocker) and ""s"" is the individual (Sheena).

   - \( x \) is the one doing the introducing,
   - \( y \) is the person being introduced,
   - \( z \) is the person to whom the introduction is made.
3. In this case:
   - \( x = w \) (Wilma is introducing),
   - \( y = k \) (Kevin is being introduced),

2. Construct the truth table: The table will include columns for C, D, ~C, ~C ⊃ D, D ⊃ C, and the conclusion (C). We will evaluate the truth values for each row.

3. Analyze the argument's validity: An argument is valid if, in every case where the premises are true, the conclusion is also true. If there is a case where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and that case serves as a counterexample.

2. In predicate logic, existential quantifiers are represented by (∃x), and conjunctions are represented by ""•"".

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the given predicate logic statements:**
   - (∃x)(Cx • Ox): This means ""There exists an x such that x is a cookie (Cx) and x has oatmeal (Ox)."" In simpler terms, ""Some cookies have oatmeal.""
   - (∀x)[(~Cx ⊃ ~Bx) ⊃ ~Og]: This means ""For all x, if x not being a cookie (~Cx) implies that x does not have chocolate chips (~Bx), then it implies that this specific cookie (g) does not have oatmeal (~Og).""

2. **Analyze the conclusion:**
   - / ~Og: The conclusion is ""~Og,"" which means ""This specific cookie (g) does not have oatmeal.""

3. **Match the interpretation:**
   - The first part of the interpretation should state that ""Some cookies have oatmeal,"" which corresponds to (∃x)(Cx • Ox).
   - The second part should interpret the universal statement (∀x)[(~Cx ⊃ ~Bx) ⊃ ~Og] correctly. This involves understanding the conditional relationships between being a cookie, having chocolate chips, and having oatmeal.
   - The final part should conclude that ""This cookie does not have oatmeal,"" which matches the conclusion (~Og).

After carefully analyzing the options:
- Option (a) correctly interprets the logic. It states:
  - ""Some cookies have oatmeal"" (matches (∃x)(Cx • Ox)).
  - ""If something's not being a cookie entails that it doesn't have chocolate chips, then this cookie doesn't have oatmeal"" (matches (∀x)[(~Cx ⊃ ~Bx) ⊃ ~Og]).

"To determine whether the set of propositions is consistent, we need to check if there is at least one valuation of truth values for the variables (N, O, P, Q) that makes all the propositions true simultaneously. Let's analyze step by step:

1. **Proposition 1: ~N ≡ (O · P)**  
   This means that ~N (not N) is logically equivalent to (O · P) (O and P). For this to be true, ~N and (O · P) must have the same truth value.

2. **Proposition 2: ~O ⊃ Q**  
   This means that if ~O (not O) is true, then Q must also be true. Alternatively, this is false only if ~O is true and Q is false.

3. **Proposition 3: N · ~Q**  
   This means that both N (N is true) and ~Q (not Q is true) must be true simultaneously.

Now, let's test the given options to see if they satisfy all three propositions:

### Option b: N, O, and P are true, and Q is false
- If N is true, then ~N is false. For ~N ≡ (O · P) to hold, (O · P) must also be false. However, O and P are both true, so (O · P) is true. This makes ~N ≡ (O · P) false. **This option is inconsistent.**

### Option c: N and O are true, and P and Q are false
- If N is true, then ~N is false. For ~N ≡ (O · P) to hold, (O · P) must also be false. O is true, but P is false, so (O · P) is false. This makes ~N ≡ (O · P) true.  
- If O is true, then ~O is false. For ~O ⊃ Q to hold, it is vacuously true because ~O is false.  
- If N is true and Q is false, then N · ~Q is true.  
**This option is consistent.**

### Option d: N and P are true, and O and Q are false
- If N is true, then ~N is false. For ~N ≡ (O · P) to hold, (O · P) must also be false. O is false, so (O · P) is false. This makes ~N ≡ (O · P) true.  
- If O is false, then ~O is true. For ~O ⊃ Q to hold, Q must be true. However, Q is false, so ~O ⊃ Q is false.  
**This option is inconsistent.**

The only consistent option is **c**.

"To determine the best symbolization, let's break down the sentence step by step:

1. The sentence states that a person is considered to have lived with you for all of the present year (L) **if**:
   - The person was born (B) or died (D) in the present year, **and**
   - Your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive (H).

2. This means that the condition (B ∨ D) • H is sufficient for L. In logical terms, this is expressed as:
   - **(B ∨ D) • H ⊃ L**

3. Now, let's compare this with the given choices:
   - a) **(B ∨ D) • H ⊃ L**: This matches the logical structure derived above.
   - b) **L ⊃ (B ∨ D) • H**: This incorrectly reverses the direction of the conditional.
   - c) **L ⊃ (B ∨ D) • H**: This is identical to (b) and is also incorrect.
   - d) **(B ∨ D • H) ⊃ L**: This misrepresents the condition by grouping D and H together incorrectly.

4. Therefore, the correct answer is **a)**.

"To solve this, I will construct a truth table for the given argument and analyze its validity step by step.

1. **Identify the components of the argument**:  
   Premise 1: (O ≡ P) ∨ P  
   Premise 2: P ∨ ~O  
   Conclusion: Analyze whether the premises lead to a valid conclusion.

2. **Construct the truth table**:  
   I will create a truth table with all possible truth values for O and P, and evaluate the premises and conclusion.

3. **Analyze the validity**:  
   An argument is valid if, in every case where the premises are true, the conclusion is also true. If there is a case where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and that case serves as a counterexample.

After completing the truth table and analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The statement ""Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name"" means that if Leroy is bad (Bl), then it must be the case that DJ Khaled shouts his name (Sk). This is a conditional statement.
2. In predicate logic, ""only if"" translates to a conditional (⊃), where the first part implies the second part.
3. Therefore, the correct translation is ""Bl ⊃ Sk"".

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The sentence is: ""If either George enrolls or Harry enrolls, then Ira does not enroll.""
   - ""Either George enrolls or Harry enrolls"" can be symbolized as \( G \lor H \).
   - ""Ira does not enroll"" can be symbolized as \( \sim I \).
   - The entire sentence is a conditional: ""If \( G \lor H \), then \( \sim I \)."" This can be symbolized as \( (G \lor H) \supset \sim I \).

2. Now, let's analyze the given choices:
   - a) \( (G \supset H) \lor I \): This does not match the structure of the sentence.
   - b) \( (G \lor H) \supset I \): This incorrectly states that if \( G \lor H \), then \( I \), which is the opposite of the intended meaning.
   - c) \( (G \supset H) \lor \sim I \): This does not match the structure of the sentence.

"To determine whether the set of propositions is consistent, we will use an indirect truth table. A set of propositions is consistent if there is at least one valuation of truth values for the variables that makes all the propositions true simultaneously.

### Step 1: Analyze the propositions
1. **(E ⊃ F) ⊃ G**: This means if E implies F, then G must be true.
2. **(~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I)**: This means (~E or F) is equivalent to (H or I).
3. **I ⊃ (J ⊃ ~H)**: This means if I is true, then J implies ~H.
4. **~G ⊃ ~J**: This means if G is false, then J must also be false.

### Step 2: Test the given valuations
We will test each of the given valuations to see if they make all the propositions true.

#### Option b: E is true, and F, G, H, I, and J are false
- **(E ⊃ F) ⊃ G**: E ⊃ F is false (since E is true and F is false), so the whole proposition is true because a false antecedent makes an implication true.
- **(~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I)**: ~E ∨ F is false (since ~E is false and F is false), and H ∨ I is also false (since H and I are both false). This equivalence is true.
- **I ⊃ (J ⊃ ~H)**: I is false, so the whole proposition is true regardless of the rest.
- **~G ⊃ ~J**: ~G is true (since G is false), and ~J is true (since J is false). This implication is true.

All propositions are true under this valuation. This set is consistent.

#### Option c: E and H are true, and F, G, I, and J are false
- **(E ⊃ F) ⊃ G**: E ⊃ F is false (since E is true and F is false), so the whole proposition is true because a false antecedent makes an implication true.
- **(~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I)**: ~E ∨ F is false (since ~E is false and F is false), and H ∨ I is true (since H is true). This equivalence is false.
- **I ⊃ (J ⊃ ~H)**: I is false, so the whole proposition is true regardless of the rest.
- **~G ⊃ ~J**: ~G is true (since G is false), and ~J is true (since J is false). This implication is true.

One proposition is false, so this valuation is inconsistent.

#### Option d: E and I are true, and F, G, H, and J are false
- **(E ⊃ F) ⊃ G**: E ⊃ F is false (since E is true and F is false), so the whole proposition is true because a false antecedent makes an implication true.
- **(~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I)**: ~E ∨ F is false (since ~E is false and F is false), and H ∨ I is true (since I is true). This equivalence is false.
- **I ⊃ (J ⊃ ~H)**: I is true, and J ⊃ ~H is true (since J is false, making the implication true). This proposition is true.
- **~G ⊃ ~J**: ~G is true (since G is false), and ~J is true (since J is false). This implication is true.

One proposition is false, so this valuation is inconsistent.

### Step 3: Conclusion
The only consistent valuation is in option b. Therefore, the correct answer is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The statement ""Some students work hard"" means there exists at least one student who works hard. This implies both conditions ""being a student"" and ""working hard"" must be true for that individual.

2. In predicate logic, ""Some"" is represented by the existential quantifier (∃x), which means ""there exists at least one x.""

3. The conjunction (•) is used to represent ""and,"" which is necessary here because the individual must satisfy both conditions: being a student (Sx) and working hard (Wx).

4. Therefore, the correct translation is (∃x)(Sx • Wx).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's break the sentence into parts and analyze step by step:

1. The sentence is: ""Either England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds.""

2. First part: ""England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.""
   - If ""England's importing beef"" (E) is a necessary condition for ""France's subsidizing agriculture"" (F), it means F ⊃ E.
   - The negation of this is ~(F ⊃ E), which can also be expressed as ~F ⊃ E (using logical equivalence).

3. Second part: ""China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds.""
   - ""China promotes human rights"" (C) and ""South Africa supplies diamonds"" (S).
   - This is a straightforward conditional: S ⊃ C.

4. Combining the two parts with ""either...or"" (logical disjunction ∨):
   - The first part is ~F ⊃ E.
   - The second part is S ⊃ C.
   - Combined: (~F ⊃ E) ∨ (S ⊃ C).

Now, compare this with the given choices:
a) (~F ⊃ E) ∨ (C ≡ ~S)  
b) (~E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ⊃ S)

   - Look for rows where both premises are true but the conclusion is false.  

4. From the truth table:  
   - In row 8, both premises are true (~A · ~B = T and (A ∨ C) ∨ B = T), but the conclusion (C) is false.  
   - This provides a counterexample, making the argument invalid.  

5. Identify the counterexample:

1. The statement ""All birds live in some nest"" means that for every bird, there exists at least one nest such that the bird lives in that nest.
2. In predicate logic, ""for every bird"" translates to a universal quantifier (∀x)Bx, and ""there exists at least one nest"" translates to an existential quantifier (∃y)Ny.
3. The relationship ""lives in"" is represented by Lxy, where x is the bird and y is the nest.
4. Combining these, the correct translation is: (∀x)(Bx ⊃ (∃y)(Ny • Lxy)).

Now, let's match this with the given choices:
- a) (∀x)(∀y)(Bx • Ny) ⊃ Lxy: This incorrectly states that for all birds and all nests, if x is a bird and y is a nest, then x lives in y. This is too strong and incorrect.
- b) (∀x)Bx ⊃ (∃y)(Ny • Lxy): This correctly states that if x is a bird, then there exists a nest y such that x lives in y. This matches the intended meaning.
- c) (∀x)(∃y)(Ny • Bx) ⊃ Lxy: This incorrectly places the existential quantifier inside the implication and does not properly express the relationship.
- d) (∀x)(∃y)(Bx • Ny) ⊃ Lxy: This incorrectly states that if there exists a bird and a nest, then the bird lives in the nest. This is not the intended meaning.

   - ""Help"" is represented by \( Hxy \), where \( x \) helps \( y \).

2. **Combine the components**:

"To determine whether the argument is valid using an indirect truth table, we need to check if there is any counterexample where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. Let's proceed step by step:

1. **Understand the premises and conclusion**:
   - Premise 1: \( L \supset [(M \lor \sim N) \supset O] \)
   - Premise 2: \( (N \supset O) \supset (\sim P \supset Q) \)
   - Premise 3: \( R \supset \sim Q \)
   - Conclusion: \( L \supset (R \supset P) \)

2. **Set up the indirect truth table**:
   - Assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false. For the conclusion \( L \supset (R \supset P) \) to be false, \( L \) must be true, and \( R \supset P \) must be false. For \( R \supset P \) to be false, \( R \) must be true, and \( P \) must be false.

3. **Assign truth values**:
   - \( L = \text{True}, R = \text{True}, P = \text{False} \).
   - Use these values to evaluate the premises and check for consistency.

4. **Evaluate Premise 1**: \( L \supset [(M \lor \sim N) \supset O] \):
   - Since \( L = \text{True} \), \( [(M \lor \sim N) \supset O] \) must also be true.
   - For \( (M \lor \sim N) \supset O \) to be true, either \( M \lor \sim N = \text{False} \) or \( O = \text{True} \).

5. **Evaluate Premise 2**: \( (N \supset O) \supset (\sim P \supset Q) \):
   - Since \( \sim P = \text{True} \) (because \( P = \text{False} \)), \( \sim P \supset Q \) depends on \( Q \).
   - For \( \sim P \supset Q \) to be true, \( Q \) must be true.

6. **Evaluate Premise 3**: \( R \supset \sim Q \):
   - Since \( R = \text{True} \), \( \sim Q \) must also be true. This means \( Q = \text{False} \).

7. **Check for consistency**:
   - From Premise 2, \( Q = \text{True} \), but from Premise 3, \( Q = \text{False} \). This is a contradiction, so the premises cannot all be true under these conditions.

8. **Test the counterexamples**:
   - Option b: \( L, M, O, Q, R = \text{True}; N, P = \text{False} \).
   - Option c: \( L, N, O, Q, R = \text{True}; M, P = \text{False} \).
   - Option d: \( L, N, R = \text{True}; M, O, P, Q = \text{False} \).

By testing these counterexamples, we find that **Option b** satisfies the premises while making the conclusion false.

2. Construct a truth table with all possible truth values for \( G \) and \( H \), and calculate the truth values for each component step by step.

3. Compare the truth values of the two propositions to determine their logical relationship:
   - If the truth values are identical in all cases, they are logically equivalent.
   - If the truth values are opposite in all cases, they are contradictory.
   - If neither, check whether there is at least one case where both are true (consistent) or no case where both are true (inconsistent).

After completing the truth table and analysis, the correct answer is: {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's break down the sentence step by step:

1. The sentence is: ""Either England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture or China's promoting human rights is not a sufficient condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds.""

2. A necessary condition means that if the consequent (France's subsidizing agriculture, F) is true, then the antecedent (England's importing beef, E) must also be true. This is symbolized as \( F \supset E \).

3. A sufficient condition means that if the antecedent (China's promoting human rights, C) is true, then the consequent (South Africa's supplying diamonds, S) must also be true. The negation of this (not a sufficient condition) is symbolized as \( \sim (C \supset S) \).

4. The sentence uses ""either...or,"" which corresponds to a disjunction (\( \vee \)).

5. Combining these, the sentence can be symbolized as \( (F \supset E) \vee \sim (C \supset S) \).

Now, let's match this with the given choices:
- a) \( (E \equiv F) \vee \sim (C \equiv S) \): Incorrect, as it uses equivalence (\( \equiv \)) instead of implication (\( \supset \)).
- b) \( (E \equiv F) \vee (\sim C \supset S) \): Incorrect, as it misrepresents the second part of the sentence.
- c) \( (E \supset F) \vee \sim (C \supset S) \): Incorrect, as it reverses the necessary condition in the first part.
- d) \( (F \supset E) \vee \sim (C \supset S) \): Correct, as it accurately represents the necessary condition and the negation of the sufficient condition.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will analyze the given predicate logic step by step and match it with the English interpretations:

1. **Wn ∨ Wm**: This means ""Either Nancy (Wn) or Marvin (Wm) are at work."" This part is consistent across all choices.

2. **(∀x)[Lx ⊃ (Dx ⊃ ~Wx)]**: This means ""For all x, if x is a lawyer (Lx), then if x is out to dinner (Dx), x is not at work (~Wx)."" This matches the phrasing ""All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner.""

3. **Ln • Dn**: This means ""Nancy (n) is a lawyer (Ln) and Nancy is out to dinner (Dn)."" This is consistent across all choices.

4. **~(∀x)~Wx**: This means ""It is not the case that everything is not at work,"" or equivalently, ""Not everything is not at work."" This matches the phrasing in the conclusion.

Now, comparing the choices:
- Choices (a) and (d) correctly interpret the conditional statement as ""All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner.""
- Choices (b) and (c) incorrectly interpret the conditional statement as ""All lawyers are out to dinner if they are not at work,"" which reverses the logical implication.
- Between (a) and (d), the conclusion ""So not everything is at work"" in (d) is incorrect because the correct conclusion is ""So not everything is not at work,"" as stated in (a).

Finally, I confirm that the other statements are premises or supporting reasons for this conclusion.

"To solve this, let's analyze the premises and the choices step by step:

1. **Premises**:
   - Premise 1: \( I \supset (J \equiv K) \) (If \( I \), then \( J \equiv K \)).
   - Premise 2: \( (J \equiv K) \supset (L \vee M) \) (If \( J \equiv K \), then \( L \) or \( M \)).
   - Premise 3: \( I \supset \neg L \) (If \( I \), then not \( L \)).

2. **Analyze each choice**:
   - **Choice a: \( \neg L \)**:
     - From Premise 3 (\( I \supset \neg L \)), if \( I \) is true, then \( \neg L \) is true. This is a direct consequence of Premise 3.
     - So, \( \neg L \) is an immediate consequence.

   - **Choice b: \( J \equiv K \)**:
     - From Premise 1 (\( I \supset (J \equiv K) \)), \( J \equiv K \) is true only if \( I \) is true. However, \( J \equiv K \) cannot be concluded directly without knowing the truth value of \( I \). Therefore, \( J \equiv K \) is **not** an immediate consequence.

   - **Choice c: \( I \supset (L \vee M) \)**:
     - From Premises 1 and 2, if \( I \) is true, then \( J \equiv K \) is true (Premise 1), and if \( J \equiv K \) is true, then \( L \vee M \) is true (Premise 2). Thus, \( I \supset (L \vee M) \) is an immediate consequence.

   - **Choice d: \( \neg L \supset (J \equiv K) \)**:
     - There is no direct connection between \( \neg L \) and \( J \equiv K \) in the premises. Therefore, \( \neg L \supset (J \equiv K) \) is **not** an immediate consequence.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The propositions that are **not** immediate consequences are \( J \equiv K \) (Choice b) and \( \neg L \supset (J \equiv K) \) (Choice d).
   - However, the question asks for the **single** proposition that is not an immediate consequence. The best answer is \( J \equiv K \) (Choice b), as it directly fails to follow from the premises.

2. I will construct a truth table with all possible truth values for \( I \) and \( J \), and evaluate \( \sim J \), \( I \equiv \sim J \), \( I \lor J \), and whether the conclusion \( I \) holds.

3. To determine validity, I check whether all rows where the premises are true also make the conclusion true.  
   - In row 1, \( I \equiv \sim J \) is false, so the premises are not both true.  
   - In row 2, both premises are true (\( I \equiv \sim J \) is true, and \( I \lor J \) is true), and the conclusion \( I \) is true.  
   - In row 3, \( I \lor J \) is true, but \( I \equiv \sim J \) is false, so the premises are not both true.  
   - In row 4, \( I \lor J \) is false, so the premises are not both true.  

Since there is no row where the premises are both true and the conclusion is false, the argument is valid.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The statement ""Some folks are lucky"" implies that there exists at least one individual who is both a ""folk"" and ""lucky.""
2. In predicate logic, ""some"" is represented by the existential quantifier (∃x), which means ""there exists at least one x.""
3. The conjunction (•) is used to combine the two properties: being a ""folk"" (Fx) and being ""lucky"" (Lx).
4. Therefore, the correct translation is (∃x)(Fx • Lx), which states that there exists at least one x such that x is a folk and x is lucky.

2. In predicate logic, the format Gxy means ""x greets y,"" where x is the one performing the greeting and y is the one being greeted.
3. Therefore, ""Ben greets Alexis"" would be represented as Gba, where b (Ben) is the one greeting and a (Alexis) is the one being greeted.

2. To negate this statement, we apply the negation to \((\forall x)(Lx \supset Rx)\), which gives us \(\sim (\forall x)(Lx \supset Rx)\).

3. Therefore, the correct translation of ""Not all lobsters are red"" is \(\sim (\forall x)(Lx \supset Rx)\).

"To determine whether the argument is valid using an indirect truth table, we need to analyze the premises and conclusion step by step. Here's the process:

   - Premise 2: \( K \equiv \sim H \)
   - Premise 3: \( \sim (K \supset J) \)
   - Conclusion: \( I \equiv J \)

2. **Set up the indirect truth table**:
   - Assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false. If this leads to a contradiction, the argument is valid. If not, the argument is invalid, and we identify a counterexample.

3. **Analyze the truth values**:
   - For \( I \equiv J \) to be false, \( I \) and \( J \) must have opposite truth values (one true, the other false).
   - Use the premises to determine the truth values of \( H \), \( K \), and \( \sim (K \supset J) \) under these conditions.

4. **Check for consistency**:
   - If the premises and the false conclusion can coexist without contradiction, the argument is invalid, and the specific truth values provide a counterexample.

After performing the analysis, the argument is **invalid**, and the counterexample occurs when \( I \) and \( H \) are true, and \( J \) and \( K \) are false.

"To solve this, I will construct the truth table step by step for the given propositions and analyze their logical relationships.

1. **Step 1: Define the components of the propositions.**
   - For the first proposition: `~(J ∨ K) · L`
     - `J ∨ K`: Logical OR of `J` and `K`.
     - `~(J ∨ K)`: Negation of `J ∨ K`.
     - `~(J ∨ K) · L`: Logical AND of `~(J ∨ K)` and `L`.

   - For the second proposition: `(L ⊃ J) · K`
     - `L ⊃ J`: Logical implication (if `L`, then `J`).
     - `(L ⊃ J) · K`: Logical AND of `L ⊃ J` and `K`.

2. **Step 2: Construct the truth table.**
   - The truth table will include all possible truth values for `J`, `K`, and `L` (8 rows for 3 variables).
   - Compute the intermediate steps for each proposition.

3. **Step 3: Analyze the truth table.**
   - Compare the truth values of `~(J ∨ K) · L` and `(L ⊃ J) · K` in each row.
   - If the truth values are the same in all rows, the propositions are **logically equivalent**.
   - If the truth values are opposite in all rows, the propositions are **contradictory**.
   - If neither, check if there is at least one row where both are true (consistent) or no row where both are true (inconsistent).

From the table:
- There is no row where both propositions are true simultaneously.
- Therefore, the propositions are **inconsistent**.

"To solve this, let's break the sentence into parts and analyze step by step:

1. The sentence is: ""Either England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture or China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds.""

2. The first part, ""England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture,"" translates to:  
   - A necessary condition means that if France subsidizes agriculture (F), then England must import beef (E).  
   - This is symbolized as \( F \supset E \) (or equivalently \( E \subset F \)).

3. The second part, ""China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds,"" translates to:  
   - ""Given that"" means ""if."" So, if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds (~S), then China promotes human rights (C).  
   - This is symbolized as \( \sim S \supset C \).

4. The sentence uses ""either ... or,"" which is a disjunction (\( \vee \)). So, the two parts are connected as:

   - ""China's promoting human rights is a necessary condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds"" can be symbolized as \( S \supset C \) (if \( S \), then \( C \)).

2. The sentence uses ""either...or,"" which corresponds to a disjunction (\( \vee \)) in propositional logic.

2. The first part, ""England's not importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture,"" translates to:  
   - A necessary condition means that if France subsidizes agriculture (F), then England is not importing beef (~E).  
   - This can be symbolized as \( F \supset \sim E \).

3. The second part, ""China promotes human rights if and only if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds,"" translates to:

"To determine the validity of the argument using an indirect truth table, we need to check whether it is possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. If such a situation exists, the argument is invalid, and we identify a counterexample. Let's proceed step by step:

1. **Analyze the premises and conclusion:**
   - Premise 1: \((K \cdot L) \supset M\)
   - Premise 2: \(N \supset \sim M\)
   - Premise 3: \(N \vee K\)
   - Conclusion: \(L \supset K\)

2. **Assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false:**
   - For \(L \supset K\) to be false, \(L\) must be true and \(K\) must be false.

3. **Work through the premises under these conditions:**
   - If \(K\) is false and \(L\) is true, then \(K \cdot L\) is false. Since \((K \cdot L) \supset M\) is true, \(M\) can be either true or false (because a false antecedent makes the conditional true).
   - If \(N \supset \sim M\) is true, then either \(N\) is false, or \(\sim M\) (i.e., \(M\) is false). This means \(N\) and \(M\) cannot both be true.
   - If \(N \vee K\) is true, then either \(N\) is true, or \(K\) is true. Since \(K\) is false, \(N\) must be true.

4. **Check for consistency:**
   - From the above, \(N\) must be true, \(K\) must be false, and \(L\) must be true. For \(N \supset \sim M\) to hold, \(M\) must be false (since \(N\) is true). This satisfies all the premises.

5. **Identify the counterexample:**
   - A counterexample occurs when \(L\) and \(N\) are true, \(K\) and \(M\) are false. This makes the premises true and the conclusion false.

Thus, the argument is invalid, and the correct counterexample is when \(L\) and \(N\) are true, and \(K\) and \(M\) are false.

4. From the truth table, the argument is invalid because there is a counterexample where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. Specifically, when M is true and N is false, the premises are satisfied, but the conclusion (N) is false.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The statement ""Some CEO is wealthier than everyone"" means there exists at least one CEO (x) such that x is wealthier than every person (y).
2. In predicate logic, ""some CEO"" is represented as (∃x)Cx, meaning there exists an x such that x is a CEO.
3. ""Wealthier than everyone"" means for all y (∀y), if y is a person (Py), then x is wealthier than y (Wxy).
4. Combining these, the correct translation is (∃x)Cx • (∀y)(Py ⊃ Wxy), which states that there exists a CEO x, and for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The statement ""All children go to some school"" means that for every individual x, if x is a child (Cx), then there exists some y such that y is a school (Sy) and x goes to y (Gxy).
2. This can be expressed in predicate logic as: (∀x)(Cx ⊃ (∃y)(Sy • Gxy)).
3. Among the given choices, the correct one matches this structure.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
