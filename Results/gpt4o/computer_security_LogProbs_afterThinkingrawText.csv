"To determine which style of fuzzer is more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in a program, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Generational fuzzers** create inputs based on a model or grammar, which can help generate valid inputs but may not specifically aim to cover every line of code. They are not inherently designed to explore all paths systematically.

2. **Blackbox fuzzers** treat the program as a black box, meaning they do not analyze the internal structure of the code. They rely on random or heuristic input generation, which makes it less likely to systematically cover every line of code.

3. **Whitebox fuzzers** analyze the internal structure of the program, often using techniques like symbolic execution to systematically explore all possible execution paths. This makes them the most likely to cover every line of code in the program.

4. **Mutation-based fuzzers** modify existing inputs to create new ones, which can help discover new paths but does not guarantee systematic exploration of all lines of code.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which attacks TLS protects against, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Replay Attack Protection**: TLS includes mechanisms such as sequence numbers and message authentication codes (MACs) to ensure that messages cannot be replayed or altered without detection. This means that an attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier would be detected and rejected. Therefore, TLS protects against replay attacks.

2. **Server Impersonation Protection**: During the TLS handshake, the server provides a certificate that is verified by the client. If the certificate is valid and trusted, the client can be confident it is communicating with the legitimate server. Since the problem states that the server certificate was checked, TLS protects against an attacker impersonating the server.

Thus, the correct answer is **True, True**.

"First, I need to understand how Kerberos tickets work. Kerberos tickets include an expiration time, which is set by the KDC when the ticket is issued. This expiration time is embedded in the ticket itself.

Next, when a client presents a ticket to a server, the server does not need to contact the KDC to validate the ticket. Instead, the server can independently verify the ticket by checking the expiration time against its own clock.

Finally, if the ticket's expiration time is in the past, the server will refuse to authenticate the user. This ensures that expired tickets cannot be used, as the server enforces the expiration policy.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

- ""BankerA"" is typically associated with banking Trojans, not remote Trojans.
- ""Game-Troj"" is related to gaming Trojans, not remote Trojans.

a) Memory leakage: This refers to a situation where a program fails to release memory that is no longer needed, but it is not typically associated with direct exploitation by attackers.
b) Buffer-overrun: This occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, potentially overwriting adjacent memory. This is a common vulnerability that attackers exploit.
c) Less processing power: This is not a coding mistake but rather a hardware limitation.

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the role of the validator in NaCl**: The validator ensures that the sandboxed code adheres to strict rules to prevent it from escaping the sandbox. This is necessary because segmentation alone cannot guarantee safety. For example, certain instructions could modify segment state or perform unsafe memory accesses.

2. **Analyzing the choices**:
   - **a) All instructions that modify segment state**: Modifying segment state could allow the sandboxed code to bypass the segmentation restrictions, so these instructions must be forbidden.
   - **b) All loads or stores to addresses that are not 0 mod 32**: This is not a general restriction in NaCl. Alignment restrictions (e.g., 0 mod 32) are not enforced for all loads or stores.
   - **c) All indirect loads or stores (via an address in a register or variable)**: Indirect memory accesses are allowed in NaCl, as long as they stay within the sandboxed memory region.
   - **d) All indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable)**: Indirect jumps could allow the sandboxed code to jump to arbitrary locations, potentially escaping the sandbox. These are forbidden unless they go through a controlled mechanism like trampolines.

3. **Conclusion**: The validator forbids instructions that modify segment state (a) and indirect jumps (d), as these could compromise the sandbox's security.

Freenet is a decentralized, peer-to-peer platform that allows users to share files anonymously, making it a part of the darknet.  
ARPANET was the precursor to the modern internet and is not related to the darknet.  
Stuxnet is a computer worm and not a darknet platform.  
The Internet is the global network and not specifically a darknet tool.

"To determine why apps developed in languages like C and C++ are prone to buffer overflow, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Understanding buffer overflow**: Buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer (a temporary storage area) than it can hold, leading to overwriting adjacent memory. This can cause crashes, unexpected behavior, or security vulnerabilities.

2. **Characteristics of C and C++**: These languages provide low-level memory access and do not inherently perform boundary checks on arrays or buffers. This means developers must manually ensure that data written to a buffer does not exceed its allocated size.

3. **Predefined functions in C and C++**: Many standard library functions, such as `strcpy`, `gets`, and `sprintf`, do not perform boundary checks on strings or buffers. This lack of automatic boundary checking is a primary reason for buffer overflow vulnerabilities in applications written in these languages.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. The Diffie-Hellman method is a cryptographic protocol that allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. However, it is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack if the communication is not secure.
2. A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an attacker intercepts and potentially alters the communication between two parties without their knowledge.
3. To prevent such attacks, the two parties need to verify each other's identities to ensure they are communicating with the intended party. This process is called authentication.

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the given MAC construction and the potential vulnerabilities step by step:

1. **Understanding the MAC construction**:  
   The MAC is constructed as \( S(k, m) = H(k \| m) \), where \( k \) is the key, \( m \) is the message, and \( H \) is a Merkle-Damgård hash function. The Merkle-Damgård construction is known to be vulnerable to length extension attacks.

2. **Length extension attack**:  
   In a length extension attack, if an attacker knows \( H(k \| m) \), they can compute \( H(k \| m \| w) \) for any \( w \) without knowing the key \( k \). This is because the internal state of the hash function after processing \( k \| m \) can be used to continue hashing additional data \( w \).

3. **Analyzing the choices**:  
   - (a) **Given \( H(k \| m) \), anyone can compute \( H(w \| k \| m \| \text{PB}) \) for any \( w \)**: This is incorrect because the attacker cannot prepend \( w \) to \( k \| m \) without knowing \( k \).
   - (b) **Given \( H(k \| m) \), anyone can compute \( H(k \| m \| w) \) for any \( w \)**: This is correct because of the length extension attack. The attacker can extend \( k \| m \) with \( w \) and compute the hash without knowing \( k \).
   - (c) **Given \( H(k \| m) \), anyone can compute \( H(k \| m \| \text{PB} \| w) \) for any \( w \)**: This is also possible due to the length extension attack, but it is a specific case of (b).
   - (d) **Anyone can compute \( H(k \| m) \) for any \( m \)**: This is incorrect because the attacker does not know \( k \), which is required to compute \( H(k \| m) \).

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The correct answer is (b), as it directly describes the vulnerability caused by the length extension attack.

"To address Alice and Bob's concern, we need to consider the security property that ensures past communications remain secure even if their encryption keys are compromised in the future.

1. **Authentication** ensures that the parties involved in the communication are who they claim to be, but it does not protect past messages if the encryption keys are compromised later. This does not address their concern.

2. **Deniability** allows a party to deny having participated in a communication, but it does not protect the confidentiality of past messages if the keys are compromised. This does not address their concern.

3. **Forward secrecy** ensures that even if the encryption keys are compromised in the future, past communications cannot be decrypted because the session keys used for encryption are not derived from the long-term keys. This directly addresses Alice and Bob's concern.

4. **Backward secrecy** ensures that future communications remain secure even if past keys are compromised, but it does not protect past messages. This does not address their concern.

   - This refers to the physical or network location of the tester, but it does not directly relate to being ""stealthy"" in the context of avoiding detection during a penetration test.  

2. **Option b**: Using encryption during tests to make the source of attacks impossible to determine.  
   - While encryption might obscure the source of attacks, it is not the primary definition of being stealthy in penetration testing.  

3. **Option c**: Performing penetration testing without the target organization knowing.  
   - This describes a ""black-box"" or ""covert"" penetration test, but being stealthy is more about avoiding detection during the test, not necessarily about whether the organization is aware of the test.  

4. **Option d**: Taking care to avoid activities during a penetration test that might attract attention, e.g., by operators or IDS services.

"To determine why blinding prevents the timing attack from working, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a**: Blinding does not prevent the server from using the CRT (Chinese Remainder Theorem) optimization. The CRT optimization is still used in RSA decryption even when blinding is applied. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option b**: Blinding does not change the prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) used in RSA. These primes remain constant and are not affected by the blinding process. Thus, this option is also incorrect.

3. **Option c**: Blinding involves multiplying the ciphertext by a random value before decryption, which effectively randomizes the input to the decryption process. This randomization obscures the relationship between the adversary's input and the timing differences observed during decryption. This is a key reason why blinding prevents timing attacks.

4. **Option d**: While blinding does involve a random value \( r \), it does not add a random amount of time to the decryption process. The timing differences exploited in the attack are not obscured by adding random delays but by randomizing the ciphertext itself. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. The timing channel attack described in the paper exploits variations in execution time caused by certain optimizations in cryptographic operations. Specifically, the attack leverages differences in timing due to conditional branches or data-dependent operations.

2. The optimizations in question are:
   - **RS (Repeated Squaring and Sliding Windows):** This optimization can introduce timing variations because the number of operations depends on the bit pattern of the exponent.
   - **KM (Karatsuba Multiplication):** This is a multiplication algorithm that can also introduce timing variations depending on the size of the operands.
   - **MR (Montgomery Representation):** This optimization is designed to make modular arithmetic more efficient, but it can also introduce timing variations.
   - **CR (Chinese Remainder):** This optimization splits computations into smaller modular arithmetic operations, which can also lead to timing variations.

3. To close the timing channel attack, we need to eliminate timing variations caused by data-dependent operations. Turning off **RS** would help because it removes the sliding window optimization, which is data-dependent. Turning off **KM** would also help because it removes operand-size-dependent variations.

4. On the other hand, turning off **MR** would not necessarily close the timing channel because MR itself is not the primary source of timing variations in this context. The same applies to **CR**.

5. Based on the options provided:
   - Turning off **RS and KM** would close the timing channel.
   - Turning off **RS and MR** would not necessarily close the timing channel.

Thus, the correct answer is **True, False**.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Public key encryption is advantageous because it eliminates the need for secure key exchange, as the public key can be shared openly, unlike symmetric key cryptography, which requires a secure method to exchange the shared key.

Finally, I conclude that the correct answer is related to the key exchange process, as public key encryption simplifies this aspect.

3. **Option c**: Restarting STP and retrying the query multiple times could be a potential solution, but it would depend on whether EXE has a mechanism to handle retries. However, this option is not typically how EXE handles timeouts.

4. **Option d**: Removing a subset of the constraints and retrying the query is a practical approach. By simplifying the query, EXE can attempt to resolve the timeout issue and continue its analysis. This aligns with EXE's design to handle constraint-solving challenges effectively.

   - Domain Validation (DV) certificates only verify control over a domain, while Extended Validation (EV) certificates involve a more rigorous verification process, including the identity of the organization. Therefore, EV certificates provide more confidence than DV certificates. This statement is **false**.

2. **Option b**: ""OCSP stapling allows a server to prove to a browser that its certificate hasn’t been revoked.""
   - OCSP stapling is a mechanism where the server provides a signed response from the Certificate Authority (CA) to prove that its certificate is still valid and hasn’t been revoked. This statement is **true**.

3. **Option c**: ""DANE makes it difficult for an adversary to launch a SSL stripping attack.""
   - DANE (DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities) uses DNSSEC to bind certificates to domain names, which helps prevent certain attacks, but SSL stripping attacks exploit the lack of HTTPS enforcement rather than certificate validation. This statement is **false**.

4. **Option d**: ""Server key-pinning makes it harder for an adversary to convince a CA to mint a certificate for a site and launch an MITM attack on that site.""
   - Server key-pinning ensures that browsers only accept specific public keys for a site, even if a rogue CA issues a certificate. This makes MITM attacks more difficult. This statement is **true**.

"To solve this, let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the role of file descriptor passing in OKWS**: OKWS (OK Web Server) uses file descriptor passing to allow processes to share access to resources like TCP connections. Without file descriptor passing, processes cannot directly share these resources unless they inherit them during a `fork` or `exec`.

2. **Analyzing the first statement**: If file descriptor passing is unavailable, services cannot receive TCP connections directly from `okd` (the OKWS dispatcher). However, since file descriptors can still be inherited during `fork` and `exec`, `okd` could fork child processes to handle connections. Thus, it would still be possible for services to get a TCP connection to the client web browser, albeit with a different design.

3. **Analyzing the second statement**: OKWS relies on `okd` to run as a privileged process (root) to bind to privileged ports (e.g., port 80) and then drop privileges to a non-root user. Without file descriptor passing, `okd` would need to retain root privileges to manage TCP connections and pass them to services, as it could not securely delegate this task to non-root processes. Therefore, it would be impossible for `okd` to run as a non-root user.

2. **Option b**: ""When copying a buffer from the stack to the heap"" - This action itself does not inherently cause a buffer overflow. A buffer overflow occurs when the size of the data being copied exceeds the size of the destination buffer, regardless of whether it's on the stack or heap.

3. **Option c**: ""When a pointer is used to access memory not allocated to it"" - This describes an ""out-of-bounds"" or ""invalid memory access"" error, which is related but not the same as a buffer overflow. A buffer overflow specifically involves writing more data to a buffer than it can hold.

4. **Option d**: ""When the program notices a buffer has filled up, and so starts to reject requests"" - This describes proper handling of a buffer to prevent overflow. A buffer overflow occurs when the program does not properly handle the situation and allows data to exceed the buffer's capacity.

The correct answer is that a buffer overflow occurs when more data is written to a buffer than it can hold, which is not explicitly described in the options.

"To determine if the MAC can be secure, let's analyze step by step:

1. A MAC (Message Authentication Code) is designed to ensure the integrity and authenticity of a message. The security of a MAC depends on the difficulty for an attacker to forge a valid tag for a message without knowing the secret key.

2. In this case, the tag \( S(k, m) \) is always 5 bits long. This means there are only \( 2^5 = 32 \) possible tags. An attacker could simply guess a tag for a given message, and the probability of guessing correctly is \( 1/32 \), which is relatively high.

3. Since the tag space is so small, an attacker can repeatedly try different messages and tags until a valid tag is found. This makes the MAC insecure, as it is vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

Next, I analyze the options:
a) Message Confidentiality refers to keeping the content of the message secret, which is not directly related to authentication.
b) Message Integrity ensures that the message has not been tampered with, which is closely related to authentication.

"To determine the most vulnerable to injection attacks, let's analyze step by step:

1. Injection attacks typically exploit vulnerabilities where untrusted input is improperly handled, allowing attackers to inject malicious code or commands.
2. Session IDs, registry keys, and network communications are not directly related to injection attacks. They may be vulnerable to other types of attacks, such as session hijacking or man-in-the-middle attacks.
3. SQL queries based on user input are highly vulnerable to injection attacks, specifically SQL injection, where attackers can manipulate the query to access or modify the database.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which attacks TLS protects against, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Attack 1: An attacker replacing bytes sent by a client with bytes of the attacker’s own choosing.**
   - TLS ensures data integrity by using Message Authentication Codes (MACs) or authenticated encryption. This means that any modification of the data in transit would be detected by the recipient, as the MAC would not match. Therefore, TLS protects against this attack.

2. **Attack 2: An attacker reading the plaintext bytes sent by a client.**
   - TLS encrypts all data transmitted between the client and server after the handshake. This encryption ensures that an attacker cannot read the plaintext bytes, as they would only see encrypted data. Therefore, TLS protects against this attack as well.

Thus, the correct answer is **True, True**.

"To determine whether \( E(k, m) \) is semantically secure under CPA, let's analyze the construction step by step:

1. **Understanding the encryption scheme**: The encryption scheme \( E(k, m) \) uses a secure PRF \( F \) and a random value \( r \) from \( R \). The ciphertext is \( (r, F(k, r) \oplus m) \), where \( F(k, r) \) is the output of the PRF and \( \oplus \) denotes XOR.

2. **Security of the scheme**: For semantic security under CPA, the ciphertext must not reveal any information about the plaintext \( m \), even if the adversary can query the encryption oracle multiple times. The security of this scheme depends on the randomness of \( r \) and the properties of the PRF \( F \):
   - If \( r \) is chosen randomly and independently for each encryption, and \( F \) is a secure PRF, then \( F(k, r) \) will appear pseudorandom to the adversary. The XOR operation with \( m \) ensures that the ciphertext does not reveal \( m \), provided \( r \) does not repeat.
   - If \( r \) repeats, the adversary can detect this by observing repeated values of \( F(k, r) \oplus m \), which would compromise security.

3. **Condition for security**: The scheme is semantically secure under CPA if \( r \) is chosen from a sufficiently large space \( R \) such that the probability of \( r \) repeating (collisions) is negligible. This ensures that the adversary cannot exploit repeated values of \( r \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1**: A U2F USB dongle prevents malware on the user’s computer from stealing the user’s second factor to authenticate as that user even when the user’s computer is turned off.  
   - U2F (Universal 2nd Factor) USB dongles are designed to provide secure two-factor authentication by generating unique cryptographic responses for each login attempt. However, if the user's computer is turned off, the dongle cannot interact with the computer or any malware on it because there is no active connection. Therefore, the statement is **false** because the dongle cannot function when the computer is off.

2. **Statement 2**: A server using U2F can reliably determine that the user who is attempting to login is indeed behind the computer that sent the login request.  
   - U2F does not verify the physical presence of the user behind the computer. It only ensures that the correct U2F device is being used to generate the cryptographic response. The server cannot determine if the user is physically present or if someone else is using the computer with the U2F device. Therefore, this statement is also **false**.

"To determine which optimizations would close the timing channel attack, we need to analyze the role of each optimization in the context of the attack described in the paper:

1. **Chinese Remainder (CR)**: This optimization speeds up modular exponentiation by splitting the computation into smaller moduli using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. However, it introduces timing variations because the computations for different moduli can take different amounts of time. Disabling CR could close the timing channel attack.

2. **Montgomery Representation (MR)**: This optimization is used to perform modular arithmetic efficiently without explicitly performing division. It does not inherently introduce timing variations, as it is designed to be constant-time. Disabling MR would not necessarily close the timing channel attack.

**Steps to solve:**
- Step 1: Understand that the timing channel attack exploits variations in computation time caused by optimizations like CR.
- Step 2: Recognize that disabling CR could close the timing channel attack, as it removes the source of timing variations.
- Step 3: Conclude that MR does not need to be disabled, as it is not the source of timing variations.

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a**: ""Programs are not allowed to reference memory using absolute addresses.""  
   This is not true. Programs can reference memory using absolute addresses, but this is not the reason why the compiler does not know the absolute address of a local variable.

2. **Option b**: ""The size of the address depends on the architecture the program will run on.""  
   While the size of an address may vary depending on the architecture (e.g., 32-bit vs. 64-bit), this does not explain why the compiler cannot determine the absolute address of a local variable.

3. **Option c**: ""As a stack-allocated variable, it could have different addresses depending on when its containing function is called.""  
   This is correct. Local variables are typically allocated on the stack, and the stack's state depends on the runtime context. Each time a function is called, the stack pointer changes, so the absolute address of a local variable is not fixed and depends on the function's call stack at runtime.

4. **Option d**: ""Compiler writers are not very good at that sort of thing.""  
   This is incorrect and not a valid reason. Compiler writers are skilled professionals, and the inability to determine the absolute address of a local variable is due to the nature of stack allocation, not a lack of expertise.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

"To determine if a stream cipher can have perfect secrecy, let's analyze the question step by step:

1. **Definition of perfect secrecy**: A cipher has perfect secrecy if the ciphertext reveals no information about the plaintext, regardless of the computational power of an adversary. This is achieved when the key is as long as the message and used only once (as in a one-time pad).

2. **Stream ciphers and keys**: Stream ciphers typically use a pseudorandom generator (PRG) to expand a short key into a long pseudorandom keystream. This keystream is then XORed with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext. However, the security of a stream cipher depends on the PRG, and the key is shorter than the message.

3. **Perfect secrecy and PRG**: A PRG cannot provide perfect secrecy because it is deterministic and relies on a shorter key. Perfect secrecy requires a truly random key that is as long as the message, which is not the case for stream ciphers.

2. The message is encrypted at the sender's site to ensure it is secure during transmission.
3. Decryption is the process of converting the encrypted message back to its original form, which must occur at the receiver's site to make the message readable.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the definitions of the given choices. A ""crypter"" is a tool used to encrypt or obfuscate code to avoid detection. A ""virus"" is a type of malicious software that replicates itself and spreads to other programs or systems. A ""backdoor"" is a hidden method of bypassing normal authentication to gain unauthorized access to a system. A ""key-logger"" is a program that records keystrokes to capture sensitive information.

Next, I need to determine which option fits the description in the question. The question describes something that can be hidden in a program, a separate infected program, a Trojan, or code in firmware. This aligns with the definition of a ""backdoor,"" as it is a hidden method of gaining unauthorized access.

Finally, I confirm that the correct answer is ""backdoor"" because it matches the description provided in the question.

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a**: Installing and configuring an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) that can read the IP header. While an IDS can help detect suspicious activity, it alone cannot specifically detect IP address spoofing by just reading the IP header. Spoofing detection often requires analyzing patterns or inconsistencies beyond just the header.

2. **Option b**: Comparing the TTL (Time to Live) values of the actual and spoofed addresses. This is a valid method because spoofed packets often have inconsistent TTL values compared to legitimate packets, as the spoofed packet's TTL may not match the expected value for the source.

3. **Option c**: Implementing a firewall to the network. Firewalls are essential for network security, but they are not specifically designed to detect IP address spoofing. They primarily block or allow traffic based on predefined rules.

4. **Option d**: Identify all TCP sessions that are initiated but do not complete successfully. While incomplete TCP sessions can indicate certain types of attacks (e.g., SYN flood), they are not a definitive method for detecting IP address spoofing.

The most accurate method for detecting IP address spoofing among the options is **comparing the TTL values**.

"First, I need to identify the role of the presentation layer in the OSI model. The presentation layer is responsible for data translation, encryption, and compression, ensuring that data is presented in a readable format for the application layer.

Next, I need to analyze each option:
a) Poor handling of unexpected input can lead to the execution of arbitrary instructions. This could be related to input validation, which is a concern at the application or presentation layer.
b) Unintentional or ill-directed use of superficially supplied input. This also relates to input handling, which can be a presentation layer issue.
c) Cryptographic flaws in the system may get exploited to evade privacy. Cryptographic operations are part of the presentation layer, so this is relevant.
d) Weak or non-existent authentication mechanisms. Authentication is typically handled at the session or application layer, not the presentation layer.

Finally, I conclude that the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Understanding the role of file descriptor passing in OKWS**:
   - OKWS (OK Web Server) uses file descriptor passing to allow processes to share access to resources like log files or database connections without directly opening them. This is crucial for security and modularity.

2. **Impact on oklogd (logging daemon)**:
   - In OKWS, services send log messages to `oklogd` by writing to a file descriptor that is passed to them. If file descriptor passing is not available, services cannot directly send messages to `oklogd` unless the file descriptor is inherited during `fork` and `exec`. However, since the problem states that file descriptors can still be inherited, this aspect would not break.

3. **Impact on database proxy connections**:
   - Services in OKWS typically connect to a database proxy using a TCP connection. If file descriptor passing is unavailable, services cannot receive a pre-established connection to the database proxy. However, they can still establish their own TCP connections directly to the database proxy, so this aspect would not break either.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Both aspects (sending messages to `oklogd` and connecting to the database proxy) would still work without file descriptor passing, as long as file descriptors can be inherited during `fork` and `exec`.

Thus, the correct answer is **b) False, False**.

"First, I need to understand the purpose of a ping sweep. A ping sweep is a network scanning technique used to determine which hosts are active or live on a network by sending ICMP echo requests to multiple IP addresses.

Next, I need to evaluate the choices. Option a) ""To identify live systems"" and option b) ""To locate live systems"" are closely related, but the term ""identify"" is more accurate in this context because the goal is to confirm which systems are active.

Option c) ""To identify open ports"" is incorrect because a ping sweep does not check for open ports; it only checks for active hosts.

Option d) ""To locate firewalls"" is also incorrect because a ping sweep is not specifically designed to identify firewalls.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to identify the four primary security principles related to messages. These principles are commonly known as Confidentiality, Integrity, Non-repudiation, and Authentication. 

Next, I will compare these principles with the given choices to find the correct match. 

The correct match is found in option a) Confidentiality, Integrity, Non-repudiation, and Authentication.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"The first step is to identify the historical context of buffer overflow attacks. The Morris Worm, released in 1988, is widely recognized as one of the first major computer worms and exploited a buffer overflow vulnerability in Unix systems. 

Next, I need to evaluate the other options. The Love Bug (2000) was a computer virus, SQL Slammer (2003) was a worm exploiting a SQL vulnerability, and Code Red (2001) was a worm exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft IIS. None of these predate the Morris Worm.

Finally, since the Morris Worm is the earliest known attack exploiting a buffer overflow, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify which type of Trojan specifically deals with sending text messages from a mobile phone number.  
Second, SMS Trojans are known for their ability to send unauthorized text messages, often leading to financial loss.  
Finally, the correct answer is SMS Trojan, as it matches the description provided in the question.

"First, I need to identify the classic security properties. The three classic security properties are Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, often referred to as the CIA triad. 

Next, I need to determine which option does not belong to the CIA triad. The option ""Correctness"" is not part of the CIA triad and is not considered a classic security property.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
