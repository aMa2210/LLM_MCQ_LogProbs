"To solve this:

1. The Barkhausen criterion is a fundamental principle for oscillators. It states that for sustained oscillations, the loop gain of the system must be equal to unity (|Aβ| = 1), where A is the amplifier gain and β is the feedback factor.
2. Additionally, the total phase shift around the loop must be 0° or an integer multiple of 360° to ensure constructive interference and sustained oscillations.
3. Based on these two conditions, the correct answer must include both the unity loop gain condition and the phase condition.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. A potentiometer measures voltage by balancing the unknown voltage against a known reference voltage without drawing current from the circuit. This ensures that the circuit being measured is not disturbed.
2. A voltmeter, on the other hand, draws a small amount of current from the circuit, which can cause a loading effect and lead to less accurate measurements.
3. Since the potentiometer does not load the circuit at all, it provides a more accurate measurement compared to a voltmeter.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which set of logic gates are designated as universal gates, let's analyze step by step:

1. Universal gates are those that can be used to implement any Boolean function without needing any other type of gate. The two gates that are universally recognized as universal gates are **NAND** and **NOR**.

2. NAND and NOR gates are sufficient to construct all other basic gates (AND, OR, NOT) and any complex logic circuit.

3. XOR, XNOR, OR, and AND are not universal gates because they cannot independently implement all Boolean functions.

Thus, the correct answer is the set containing **NOR** and **NAND**.

"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Understand the problem**: The circuit is a single-phase one-pulse controlled rectifier with a resistive load and a counter emf \( E \). The source voltage is \( 400 \sin(314t) \), which has a peak value of 400 V. The counter emf \( E \) is given as 200 V. The firing angle control range is determined by the condition that the rectifier can only conduct when the instantaneous source voltage exceeds the counter emf.

2. **Determine the condition for conduction**: The rectifier will conduct when the instantaneous source voltage \( v_s = 400 \sin(\omega t) \) is greater than or equal to the counter emf \( E = 200 \). This gives the inequality:
   \[
   400 \sin(\omega t) \geq 200
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \sin(\omega t) \geq 0.5
   \]

3. **Find the angles where \( \sin(\omega t) = 0.5 \)**: The sine function equals 0.5 at two points in one cycle:
   \[
   \omega t = 30^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \omega t = 150^\circ
   \]
   Therefore, conduction occurs between \( 30^\circ \) and \( 150^\circ \).

4. **Determine the firing angle range**: The firing angle \( \alpha \) is the angle at which the rectifier starts conducting. For the rectifier to conduct, the firing angle must be within the range where the source voltage exceeds the counter emf. Thus, the firing angle range is:
   \[
   30^\circ \leq \alpha \leq 150^\circ
   \]

The correct answer is:

"First, I need to recall that the electric field produced by a single infinite charged plate with surface charge density \(\sigma\) is given by \(E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}\), where \(\epsilon_0\) is the permittivity of free space.

Next, since the two plates are charged with equal surface charge density of the same polarity, the electric fields produced by each plate in the region between them will point in opposite directions (due to the same polarity of charges).

Finally, because the fields are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, they will cancel each other out in the gap between the plates, resulting in a net electric field of zero.

Next, when ALE is high, it enables the external latch to capture the lower-order address from the multiplexed bus. This allows the data bus to be used for data transfer after the address has been latched.

Finally, the correct function of ALE is to enable the data bus to be used as a low-order address bus by latching the address.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the given data**:
   - The gate cathode characteristic is a straight line of 130. This means the gate current (I_g) is related to the gate voltage (V_g) by the slope of the line, which is 130.
   - Triggered source voltage (V_g) = 15 V.
   - Allowable gate power dissipation (P_g) = 0.5 W.

2. **Calculate the gate current (I_g)**:
   - Power dissipation in the gate is given by \( P_g = V_g \cdot I_g \).
   - Rearranging for \( I_g \), we get:
     \[
     I_g = \frac{P_g}{V_g} = \frac{0.5}{15} = 0.0333 \, \text{A} \, \text{(or 33.3 mA)}.
     \]

3. **Calculate the gate source resistance (R_g)**:
   - The gate source resistance is given by \( R_g = \frac{V_g}{I_g} \).
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     R_g = \frac{15}{0.0333} \approx 450 \, \text{ohms}.
     \]

4. **Adjust for the characteristic slope**:
   - The characteristic slope of 130 means the actual resistance is modified by this factor. Dividing the calculated resistance by the slope:
     \[
     R_g = \frac{450}{130} \approx 111.9 \, \text{ohms}.
     \]

   - \(A = \pi r^2\) (cross-sectional area of the solenoid, with \(r\) being the radius),
   - \(l = 0.3 \, \text{m}\) (length of the solenoid).

3. First, calculate the cross-sectional area \(A\):
   \[
   r = \frac{\text{diameter}}{2} = \frac{3 \, \text{cm}}{2} = 1.5 \, \text{cm} = 0.015 \, \text{m}
   \]
   \[
   A = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.015)^2 = 7.0686 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^2
   \]

4. Now, calculate the inductance \(L\):
   \[
   L = \mu_0 \frac{N^2 A}{l} = (4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \frac{(1000)^2 (7.0686 \times 10^{-4})}{0.3}
   \]
   \[
   L = (4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \frac{10^6 \times 7.0686 \times 10^{-4}}{0.3}
   \]
   \[
   L = (4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \frac{7.0686 \times 10^{-1}}{0.3}
   \]
   \[
   L = (4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \times 2.3562
   \]
   \[
   L = 2.96 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{H}

5. Finally, calculate the energy stored \(U\):
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} L I^2 = \frac{1}{2} (2.96 \times 10^{-6}) (10)^2
   \]
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} (2.96 \times 10^{-6}) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   U = 1.48 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{J}

2. In an RC network, the critical frequency is determined by the resistor and capacitor values, and it is common to have a pole near the origin due to the capacitor's behavior.

3. In an RL network, the critical frequency is determined by the resistor and inductor values, and a pole can also be present near the origin due to the inductor's behavior.

"To solve this, I will use the relationship between the number of tangencies and the frequency ratio in a Lissajous pattern.

1. The number of horizontal tangencies corresponds to the numerator of the frequency ratio, and the number of vertical tangencies corresponds to the denominator. Thus, the frequency ratio is 5:2.

2. The horizontal input frequency is given as 100 Hz. Since the ratio of horizontal to vertical frequencies is 5:2, the vertical frequency can be calculated as:

"To determine why a sinusoidal signal is considered an analog signal, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. A sinusoidal signal is an analog signal because it is continuous in nature and can take on an infinite number of values within its range. This aligns with option (a), which states that it ""can have a number of values between the negative and positive peaks.""

2. Option (b) states that it ""is negative for one half cycle."" While this is true for a sinusoidal signal, it does not explain why it is considered an analog signal.

3. Option (c) states that it ""is positive for one half cycle."" Again, this is true for a sinusoidal signal, but it does not justify its classification as an analog signal.

4. Option (d) states that it ""has positive as well as negative values."" While this is a characteristic of a sinusoidal signal, it does not directly explain why it is analog.

1. The Ward-Leonard system is a method of speed control for DC motors. It involves a motor-generator set where the speed of the motor is controlled by varying the voltage applied to its armature.
2. The lower limit of speed in this system is determined by the residual magnetism of the generator. This is because even when the field current is reduced to zero, the generator still produces a small voltage due to residual magnetism.
3. This residual voltage limits how low the speed of the motor can go.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

"To solve this, let's proceed step by step:

1. The half-cycle surge current rating of the SCR is given as 3000 A for a 50 Hz supply. The time period of one cycle for a 50 Hz supply is \( T = \frac{1}{50} = 0.02 \) seconds. Therefore, the duration of a half-cycle is \( \frac{T}{2} = 0.01 \) seconds.

2. The surge current rating for one cycle is related to the half-cycle surge current rating. The one-cycle surge current is calculated using the root mean square (RMS) value of the current over the entire cycle. For sinusoidal waveforms, the RMS value of the current over one cycle is \( \sqrt{2} \) times the half-cycle surge current.

3. Using the formula, the one-cycle surge current is:
   \[
   I_{\text{one-cycle}} = I_{\text{half-cycle}} \times \sqrt{2} = 3000 \times \sqrt{2} \approx 3000 \times 1.414 = 4242.64 \, \text{A}.

"First, I need to analyze the reasons why low frequency supply is necessary for direct core type induction furnaces. 

1. At normal frequency, the electromagnetic forces can cause severe stirring action in the molten metal, which can disrupt the process. This makes low frequency supply preferable to reduce such stirring effects. 

2. Additionally, at normal frequency, the magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary circuit is poor, which affects the efficiency of the furnace. Low frequency improves this coupling.

"To determine which lamp has the best Colour Rendering Index (CRI), let's analyze step by step:

1. The Colour Rendering Index (CRI) measures how accurately a light source reveals the colors of objects compared to natural light. A CRI of 100 is considered perfect, meaning the light source renders colors as they would appear under natural sunlight.

2. Incandescent lamps typically have a CRI of 100 because they emit a continuous spectrum of light, closely resembling natural sunlight. This makes them excellent for color rendering.

3. LED lamps can have a wide range of CRI values, depending on their design and quality. High-quality LEDs can achieve CRI values close to 90 or above, but they generally do not reach the perfect CRI of 100.

4. Fluorescent lamps usually have a CRI between 60 and 90, depending on the type and phosphor coating. They are not as good as incandescent lamps for color rendering.

5. High-pressure sodium vapor lamps have a very low CRI, typically around 20 to 30, making them poor at rendering colors accurately.

Based on this analysis, the lamp with the best CRI is the incandescent lamp. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the requirements for the material of the electrode in electrical resistance welding step by step:

1. **Electrical Conductivity**: The electrode material should have high electrical conductivity to allow efficient current flow and minimize energy loss during the welding process. This ensures that the heat is generated primarily at the weld joint and not in the electrode itself.

2. **Thermal Conductivity**: The electrode material should also have high thermal conductivity to dissipate heat quickly and prevent overheating of the electrode, which could lead to damage or deformation.

3. **Strength at Elevated Temperatures**: The electrode material must have sufficient mechanical strength to withstand the high pressure applied during the welding process, even at elevated temperatures, to maintain proper contact and ensure a strong weld.

Since all three properties are essential for the electrode material in electrical resistance welding, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the requirements for materials used in heat sinks step by step:

   The subtransient reactance \( X'' \) is given as 16%, which is equivalent to 0.16 pu.

2. **Calculate the equivalent reactance of all four alternators in parallel:**  
   Since the alternators are identical and connected in parallel, the equivalent reactance \( X_{eq} \) is given by:

   X_{eq} = \frac{X''}{\text{Number of alternators}} = \frac{0.16}{4} = 0.04 \, \text{pu}.
   \]

3. **Determine the base MVA and base voltage:**  
   The base MVA is the rating of one alternator, which is 20 MVA. The base voltage is 11 kV.

4. **Calculate the short circuit level at the busbar:**  
   The short circuit level (SCL) is given by:  
   \[
   \text{SCL} = \frac{\text{Base MVA}}{X_{eq}} = \frac{20}{0.04} = 500 \, \text{MVA}.

"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. The resistance of a conductor is given by the formula \( R = \rho \frac{l}{A} \), where:
   - \( \rho \) is the resistivity of the material,
   - \( l \) is the length of the conductor,
   - \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the conductor.

2. The cross-sectional area \( A \) of a conductor with diameter \( d \) is \( A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} \). If the diameter is halved (\( d' = \frac{d}{2} \)), the new cross-sectional area becomes:
   \[
   A' = \frac{\pi (d/2)^2}{4} = \frac{\pi d^2}{16}.
   \]
   So, the new area is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the original area.

3. If the length of the conductor is doubled (\( l' = 2l \)), the new resistance becomes:
   \[
   R' = \rho \frac{l'}{A'} = \rho \frac{2l}{A/4} = \rho \frac{2l}{\frac{\pi d^2}{16}} = \rho \frac{2l \cdot 16}{\pi d^2}.
   \]
   Comparing this with the original resistance \( R = \rho \frac{l}{A} = \rho \frac{l}{\frac{\pi d^2}{4}} = \rho \frac{4l}{\pi d^2} \), we see that:
   \[
   R' = 4R.

Thus, the resistance becomes 4 times the original resistance.

"First, I need to consider the setup: a conductor above a conducting plane with a high voltage between them. The electric field is strongest where the curvature of the conductor is highest, as the field lines are denser there.

Next, the conductor is round and smooth, so the electric stress (electric field intensity) will be maximum at the surface of the conductor, as the field lines emerge perpendicularly from the surface.

Finally, since the ground is a large conducting plane, the electric stress will not be maximum there or midway between the conductor and the ground. The maximum stress will occur at the lower surface of the conductor, which is closest to the ground.

   Since all five capacitors have the same capacitance of 5 µF, the formula becomes:

   \[
   \Phi_D = Q_{\text{enclosed}}

   where \( Q_{\text{enclosed}} \) is the total charge enclosed by the cube.

3. **Calculate the total charge enclosed**:  
   The total charge on the metal surface is given by:  
   \[
   Q = \sigma \cdot A
   \]  
   where \( \sigma = 20 \, \text{C/m}^2 \) is the surface charge density, and \( A = 4\pi r^2 \) is the surface area of the metal sphere.  
   Substituting \( r = 1 \, \text{m} \):  
   \[
   A = 4\pi (1)^2 = 4\pi \, \text{m}^2

   So, the total charge is:  
   \[
   Q = 20 \cdot 4\pi = 80\pi \, \text{C}
