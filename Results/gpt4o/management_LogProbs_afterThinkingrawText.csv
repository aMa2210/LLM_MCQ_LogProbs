"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze the options step by step:

1. **Bargaining** refers to the process of negotiating or discussing terms to reach an agreement. It does not specifically describe the outcome of negotiations.
2. **Satisficing** is a decision-making strategy where parties aim for a solution that meets minimum acceptable criteria rather than the optimal solution. This term aligns with the idea of a sub-optimal but acceptable outcome.
3. **Accepting** simply means agreeing to something, but it does not imply a negotiation process or a sub-optimal outcome.
4. **Compromising** involves making concessions to reach a mutual agreement, but it does not specifically imply a sub-optimal outcome.

The term that best fits the description of a sub-optimal but acceptable outcome is ""Satisficing.""

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the assumptions underpinning the rational decision-making model step by step:

1. The rational decision-making model assumes that decision-makers have complete information about the problem and the environment. This means that ""incomplete information"" is not an assumption of the model.

2. The model also assumes that there is an agreed-upon goal or objective that guides the decision-making process. This ensures that all alternatives are evaluated against a common standard.

3. A structured problem is another assumption of the model, as it requires a clear and well-defined problem to apply logical and systematic steps.

4. Lastly, the model assumes a high level of certainty regarding the environment, meaning that outcomes of decisions can be predicted with confidence.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

"First, I need to identify which writer focused on the reaction of workers to bureaucracies. Max Weber is known for his work on the structure and characteristics of bureaucracies, but his focus was more on the ideal type of bureaucracy rather than workers' reactions. 

Next, Robert Merton expanded on Weber's ideas and discussed the dysfunctions of bureaucracies, including how workers might react to rigid rules and impersonality, leading to issues like goal displacement.

Then, Alvin Gouldner studied bureaucracies and their impact on workers, particularly focusing on the unintended consequences of bureaucratic rules and how workers adapt or resist them.

Finally, Elton Mayo is associated with the human relations movement and focused on worker behavior and motivation, but not specifically in the context of bureaucracies.

The writer most concerned with workers' reactions to bureaucracies is Merton. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"The optimal span of control depends on various factors such as the complexity of tasks, the skill level of employees, and the management style. There is no universally agreed-upon number that applies to all situations. 

Step 1: Historically, management theories suggest that a span of control of 5 to 7 subordinates is often effective for most managers. This range allows for adequate supervision and communication without overwhelming the manager.

Step 2: However, modern organizations may have different needs. For example, in highly automated or skilled environments, a manager might effectively oversee more than 7 subordinates. Conversely, in complex or high-touch environments, a smaller span of control might be necessary.

Step 3: Since the question asks for the ""optimal"" span of control and none of the provided options universally apply to all situations, the correct answer is ""None of the above.""
