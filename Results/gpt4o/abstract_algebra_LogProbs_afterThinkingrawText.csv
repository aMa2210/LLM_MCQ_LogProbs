"To solve this, let's proceed step by step:

1. **Understand the field extension**: The field \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{18}) \) is generated by adjoining \( \sqrt{2} \), \( \sqrt{3} \), and \( \sqrt{18} \) to \( \mathbb{Q} \). Note that \( \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2} \), so \( \sqrt{18} \) is already in \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \). Thus, the field extension simplifies to \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \).

2. **Determine the degree of \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \)**:
   - First, consider \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \). The minimal polynomial of \( \sqrt{2} \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is \( x^2 - 2 \), which is irreducible. Hence, the degree of \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is 2.
   - Next, consider \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \) as an extension of \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \). The minimal polynomial of \( \sqrt{3} \) over \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \) is \( x^2 - 3 \), which is irreducible because \( \sqrt{3} \notin \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \). Thus, the degree of \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \) is also 2.

3. **Apply the tower law**: By the tower law, the degree of \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is the product of the degrees:
   \[
   [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) : \mathbb{Q}] = [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) : \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})] \cdot [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) : \mathbb{Q}] = 2 \cdot 2 = 4.
   \]

Thus, the degree of the field extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{18}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is 4.

"To solve this, we need to determine the order of the element \( p \) and then calculate the index of the subgroup \( \langle p \rangle \) in \( S_5 \).

1. **Find the order of \( p \):**
   - The permutation \( p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) \) is a product of disjoint cycles. However, \( (1, 2, 5, 4) \) and \( (2, 3) \) are not disjoint because they both involve the element \( 2 \). Therefore, we must rewrite \( p \) as a single cycle or product of disjoint cycles.
   - Start with \( 1 \): \( 1 \to 2 \) (from \( (1, 2, 5, 4) \)), and \( 2 \to 3 \) (from \( (2, 3) \)), so \( 1 \to 3 \).
   - Next, \( 3 \to 3 \) (from \( (1, 2, 5, 4) \)), and \( 3 \to 2 \) (from \( (2, 3) \)), so \( 3 \to 2 \).
   - Then, \( 2 \to 5 \) (from \( (1, 2, 5, 4) \)), and \( 5 \to 5 \) (not affected by \( (2, 3) \)), so \( 2 \to 5 \).
   - Finally, \( 5 \to 4 \) (from \( (1, 2, 5, 4) \)), and \( 4 \to 4 \) (not affected by \( (2, 3) \)), so \( 5 \to 4 \).
   - Continuing, \( 4 \to 1 \) (from \( (1, 2, 5, 4) \)), and \( 1 \to 1 \) (not affected by \( (2, 3) \)), so \( 4 \to 1 \).
   - Thus, \( p = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4) \), a single 5-cycle.

2. **Determine the order of \( p \):**
   - The order of a cycle is the length of the cycle. Since \( p = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4) \) is a 5-cycle, the order of \( p \) is 5.

3. **Calculate the index of \( \langle p \rangle \) in \( S_5 \):**
   - The subgroup \( \langle p \rangle \) generated by \( p \) has order equal to the order of \( p \), which is 5.
   - The index of a subgroup in a group is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Index} = \frac{\text{Order of the group}}{\text{Order of the subgroup}}.
     \]
   - The order of \( S_5 \) is \( 5! = 120 \), and the order of \( \langle p \rangle \) is 5. Therefore, the index is:
     \[
     \text{Index} = \frac{120}{5} = 24.
     \]

Thus, the index of \( \langle p \rangle \) in \( S_5 \) is 24.

"To solve this, I will evaluate the polynomial \( f(x) = x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \) for all possible values of \( x \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), which are \( \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\} \). A zero of the polynomial is a value of \( x \) such that \( f(x) \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \).

1. **Evaluate \( f(0) \):**
   Substituting \( x = 0 \), we get:
   \[
   f(0) = 0^5 + 3(0^3) + 0^2 + 2(0) = 0.
   \]
   So, \( f(0) \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), and \( x = 0 \) is a zero.

2. **Evaluate \( f(1) \):**
   Substituting \( x = 1 \), we get:
   \[
   f(1) = 1^5 + 3(1^3) + 1^2 + 2(1) = 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 7.
   \]
   Reducing modulo 5, \( 7 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \). So, \( x = 1 \) is not a zero.

3. **Evaluate \( f(2) \):**
   Substituting \( x = 2 \), we get:
   \[
   f(2) = 2^5 + 3(2^3) + 2^2 + 2(2) = 32 + 24 + 4 + 4 = 64.
   \]
   Reducing modulo 5, \( 64 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \). So, \( x = 2 \) is not a zero.

4. **Evaluate \( f(3) \):**
   Substituting \( x = 3 \), we get:
   \[
   f(3) = 3^5 + 3(3^3) + 3^2 + 2(3) = 243 + 81 + 9 + 6 = 339.
   \]
   Reducing modulo 5, \( 339 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \). So, \( x = 3 \) is not a zero.

5. **Evaluate \( f(4) \):**
   Substituting \( x = 4 \), we get:
   \[
   f(4) = 4^5 + 3(4^3) + 4^2 + 2(4) = 1024 + 192 + 16 + 8 = 1240.
   \]
   Reducing modulo 5, \( 1240 \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \). So, \( x = 4 \) is a zero.

Thus, the zeros of the polynomial are \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 4 \).

"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

**Statement 1**: A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian.  
- A factor group (or quotient group) is formed by dividing a group \( G \) by one of its normal subgroups \( N \). The resulting group \( G/N \) can be either Abelian or non-Abelian, depending on the structure of \( G \) and \( N \).  
- For example, consider the symmetric group \( S_3 \), which is non-Abelian. If we take its normal subgroup \( A_3 \) (the alternating group), the factor group \( S_3 / A_3 \) is isomorphic to \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \), which is Abelian.  
- Therefore, the statement is **false** because a factor group of a non-Abelian group can be Abelian.

**Statement 2**: If \( K \) is a normal subgroup of \( H \) and \( H \) is a normal subgroup of \( G \), then \( K \) is a normal subgroup of \( G \).  
- This statement is generally **false**. While \( K \) is normal in \( H \), and \( H \) is normal in \( G \), it does not necessarily imply that \( K \) is normal in \( G \).  
- A counterexample is the quaternion group \( Q_8 \), where \( K = \{1, -1\} \), \( H = Q_8 \), and \( G = S_4 \). Here, \( K \) is normal in \( H \), and \( H \) is normal in \( G \), but \( K \) is not normal in \( G \).  
- Therefore, this statement is also **false**.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate the product of the polynomials \( f(x) = 4x - 5 \) and \( g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 \) in the ring \( \mathbb{Z}_8[x] \), where coefficients are reduced modulo 8.

1. First, expand the product \( f(x) \cdot g(x) \):
   \[
   (4x - 5)(2x^2 - 4x + 2) = 4x(2x^2 - 4x + 2) - 5(2x^2 - 4x + 2).
   \]

2. Compute each term:
   - \( 4x(2x^2 - 4x + 2) = 8x^3 - 16x^2 + 8x \).
   - \( -5(2x^2 - 4x + 2) = -10x^2 + 20x - 10 \).

3. Reduce coefficients modulo 8:
   - \( 8x^3 \equiv 0 \mod 8 \), \( -16x^2 \equiv 0 \mod 8 \), \( 8x \equiv 0 \mod 8 \).
   - \( -10x^2 \equiv -2x^2 \mod 8 \), \( 20x \equiv 4x \mod 8 \), \( -10 \equiv -2 \mod 8 \).

   So, the product becomes:
   \[
   0x^3 + (0 - 2)x^2 + (0 + 4)x + (-2) = -2x^2 + 4x - 2.
   \]

4. Reduce the final polynomial modulo 8:
   - \( -2x^2 \equiv 6x^2 \mod 8 \),
   - \( 4x \equiv 4x \mod 8 \),
   - \( -2 \equiv 6 \mod 8 \).

   Thus, the product is:
   \[
   6x^2 + 4x + 6.

"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

**Statement 1**: If a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15.  
1. In a group, the elements of a given order are distributed in conjugacy classes. The size of each conjugacy class divides the order of the group.  
2. If the group has an element of order 15, then the group must have elements of order 15 in conjugacy classes. The number of such elements depends on the structure of the group, but there is no strict rule that it must have at least 8 elements of order 15.  
3. Therefore, **Statement 1 is false**.

**Statement 2**: If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.  
1. If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, the total number of such elements must be a multiple of the size of the conjugacy classes.  
2. Since the number of elements of a given order must be a multiple of the size of the conjugacy classes, having more than 8 elements implies that the group must have at least 16 elements of order 15.  
3. Therefore, **Statement 2 is true**.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1**: ""Every homomorphic image of a group G is isomorphic to a factor group of G.""
   - By the First Isomorphism Theorem, if \( \phi: G \to H \) is a group homomorphism, then the image of \( \phi \) (a subgroup of \( H \)) is isomorphic to \( G / \ker(\phi) \), where \( \ker(\phi) \) is the kernel of \( \phi \). This means that every homomorphic image of \( G \) is indeed isomorphic to a factor group of \( G \). 
   - Therefore, **Statement 1 is true**.

2. **Statement 2**: ""The homomorphic images of a group G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G.""
   - While every homomorphic image of \( G \) is isomorphic to a factor group of \( G \), not every factor group of \( G \) corresponds to a homomorphic image. For example, a factor group \( G / N \) exists for any normal subgroup \( N \) of \( G \), but not all such factor groups necessarily correspond to distinct homomorphic images. Hence, this statement is **false**.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1**: A ring homomorphism is one-to-one if and only if the kernel is {0}.
   - A ring homomorphism \( f: R \to S \) is one-to-one (injective) if \( f(a) = f(b) \) implies \( a = b \). This is equivalent to saying that the kernel of \( f \), defined as \( \text{ker}(f) = \{x \in R \mid f(x) = 0\} \), contains only the zero element of \( R \). This is a standard result in ring theory.
   - Therefore, Statement 1 is **True**.

2. **Statement 2**: \( Q \) is an ideal in \( R \).
   - The statement does not provide any context or definition of \( Q \) and \( R \). Without additional information, we cannot determine whether \( Q \) is an ideal in \( R \). Thus, Statement 2 is **False** due to lack of sufficient information.

Now, combining the results:
- Statement 1 is True.
- Statement 2 is False.

"To determine the degree of the field extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Step 1: Determine the minimal polynomial of \( \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \):**  
   Let \( \alpha = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} \). Then, \( \alpha^2 = (\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})^2 = 2 + 3 + 2\sqrt{6} = 5 + 2\sqrt{6} \).  
   Rearrange to isolate \( \sqrt{6} \):  
   \( \alpha^2 - 5 = 2\sqrt{6} \), so \( \sqrt{6} = \frac{\alpha^2 - 5}{2} \).  
   Squaring again, \( (\sqrt{6})^2 = 6 \), gives:  
   \( \left(\frac{\alpha^2 - 5}{2}\right)^2 = 6 \).  
   Simplify:  
   \( \frac{(\alpha^2 - 5)^2}{4} = 6 \), so \( (\alpha^2 - 5)^2 = 24 \).  
   Expand:  
   \( \alpha^4 - 10\alpha^2 + 25 = 24 \), so \( \alpha^4 - 10\alpha^2 + 1 = 0 \).  
   Thus, the minimal polynomial of \( \alpha \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is \( x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 \).

2. **Step 2: Check the degree of the minimal polynomial:**  
   The polynomial \( x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 \) is a quartic polynomial. To confirm it is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Q} \), note that it has no rational roots (use the Rational Root Theorem). Additionally, it cannot be factored into lower-degree polynomials with rational coefficients. Hence, it is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Q} \).

3. **Step 3: Conclude the degree of the field extension:**  
   Since the minimal polynomial of \( \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) has degree 4, the degree of the field extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is 4.

"To solve this, I will find the zeros of the polynomial \(x^3 + 2x + 2\) in the finite field \(Z_7\), which consists of integers modulo 7 (\(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\)).

1. **Substitute each element of \(Z_7\) into the polynomial \(x^3 + 2x + 2\) and compute the result modulo 7.**  
   - For \(x = 0\): \(0^3 + 2(0) + 2 = 2 \mod 7 = 2\) (not a zero).

   - For \(x = 3\): \(3^3 + 2(3) + 2 = 27 + 6 + 2 = 35 \mod 7 = 0\) (a zero).  
   - For \(x = 4\): \(4^3 + 2(4) + 2 = 64 + 8 + 2 = 74 \mod 7 = 4\) (not a zero).  
   - For \(x = 5\): \(5^3 + 2(5) + 2 = 125 + 10 + 2 = 137 \mod 7 = 4\) (not a zero).  
   - For \(x = 6\): \(6^3 + 2(6) + 2 = 216 + 12 + 2 = 230 \mod 7 = 6\) (not a zero).  

2. **Identify the zeros.**  
   From the above calculations, the zeros of the polynomial are \(x = 2\) and \(x = 3\).

"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1**: If \( H \) is a subgroup of \( G \) and \( a \) belongs to \( G \), then \( |aH| = |Ha| \).  
   - The left coset \( aH \) and the right coset \( Ha \) of a subgroup \( H \) in a group \( G \) have the same cardinality. This is a standard result in group theory.  
   - Therefore, Statement 1 is **true**.

2. **Statement 2**: If \( H \) is a subgroup of \( G \) and \( a, b \) belong to \( G \), then \( aH \) and \( Hb \) are identical or disjoint.  
   - This statement is **false** because left cosets (\( aH \)) and right cosets (\( Hb \)) are not necessarily related in this way. The property of being identical or disjoint applies to left cosets among themselves or right cosets among themselves, but not between left and right cosets.  
   - Therefore, Statement 2 is **false**.

"To solve this, let's analyze the given relation step by step:

1. **Symmetric Property**: A relation is symmetric if for every (a, b) in the relation, (b, a) is also in the relation. In this case, the relation S = {(1, 1), (2, 2)} contains only pairs where a = b. Since there are no pairs (a, b) where a ≠ b, the symmetric property is satisfied.

2. **Anti-symmetric Property**: A relation is anti-symmetric if for every (a, b) and (b, a) in the relation, a = b. In this case, the relation S contains only pairs where a = b, so the anti-symmetric property is also satisfied.

3. **Equivalence Relation**: A relation is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. The relation S is not reflexive because it does not include (3, 3), so it is not an equivalence relation.

Thus, the relation S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric.

"To solve this, let's proceed step by step:

1. **Understand the structure of the group \( \mathbb{Z}_{11} \times \mathbb{Z}_{15} \):**
   - The group \( \mathbb{Z}_{11} \) has order 11, and \( \mathbb{Z}_{15} \) has order 15.
   - Therefore, the group \( \mathbb{Z}_{11} \times \mathbb{Z}_{15} \) has order \( 11 \times 15 = 165 \).

2. **Understand the subgroup \( \langle (1, 1) \rangle \):**
   - The element \( (1, 1) \) generates a cyclic subgroup of \( \mathbb{Z}_{11} \times \mathbb{Z}_{15} \).
   - The order of \( (1, 1) \) is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of its components in \( \mathbb{Z}_{11} \) and \( \mathbb{Z}_{15} \).
     - In \( \mathbb{Z}_{11} \), the order of 1 is 11.
     - In \( \mathbb{Z}_{15} \), the order of 1 is 15.
     - Thus, the order of \( (1, 1) \) is \( \text{lcm}(11, 15) = 165 \).

3. **Determine the order of the factor group \( (\mathbb{Z}_{11} \times \mathbb{Z}_{15}) / \langle (1, 1) \rangle \):**
   - The order of the factor group is the order of \( \mathbb{Z}_{11} \times \mathbb{Z}_{15} \) divided by the order of the subgroup \( \langle (1, 1) \rangle \).
   - Since both the group and the subgroup have order 165, the factor group has order \( 165 / 165 = 1 \).

"To solve this, I will factorize the polynomial \( x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_7[x] \), the field of integers modulo 7.

1. **Step 1: Check for roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \):**  
   A root \( r \) of the polynomial satisfies \( f(r) \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \). I will test \( r = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \) to find roots.  
   - For \( r = 0 \): \( f(0) = 0^3 + 2(0^2) + 2(0) + 1 = 1 \neq 0 \).  
   - For \( r = 1 \): \( f(1) = 1^3 + 2(1^2) + 2(1) + 1 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 \neq 0 \).  
   - For \( r = 2 \): \( f(2) = 2^3 + 2(2^2) + 2(2) + 1 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 21 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \).  
     So, \( r = 2 \) is a root.  

2. **Step 2: Factor out \( (x - 2) \):**  
   Using synthetic division, divide \( x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 \) by \( (x - 2) \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \):  
   - Coefficients of \( f(x) \): \( [1, 2, 2, 1] \).

     So, \( f(x) = (x - 2)(x^2 + 4x + 3) \).  

3. **Step 3: Factor \( x^2 + 4x + 3 \):**  
   To factor \( x^2 + 4x + 3 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \), find two numbers \( a, b \) such that \( a + b \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \) and \( ab \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \).  
   - Testing pairs:  
     - \( a = 1, b = 3 \): \( 1 + 3 = 4 \) and \( 1 \cdot 3 = 3 \).  
     So, \( x^2 + 4x + 3 = (x + 1)(x + 3) \).  

4. **Step 4: Combine the factors:**  
   The full factorization is \( f(x) = (x - 2)(x + 1)(x + 3) \).  
   In \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \), \( x + 3 \equiv x - 4 \pmod{7} \).

"To solve this, I will determine the maximum possible order of an element in the symmetric group \( S_n \) for \( n = 10 \).

1. The order of an element in \( S_n \) is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the disjoint cycles in its cycle decomposition. To maximize the order, we need to maximize the LCM of the cycle lengths while ensuring the sum of the cycle lengths equals \( n = 10 \).

2. The best way to maximize the LCM is to use cycle lengths that are relatively prime. For \( n = 10 \), the cycle decomposition that achieves this is \( (7, 3) \), as 7 and 3 are relatively prime and their sum is 10.

3. The LCM of 7 and 3 is \( \text{lcm}(7, 3) = 7 \times 3 = 21 \). Thus, the maximum possible order of an element in \( S_{10} \) is 21.

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1**: ""R is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q.""
   - The splitting field of a polynomial is the smallest field extension over which the polynomial splits into linear factors (i.e., all its roots lie in the field).
   - The field of real numbers, R, is not algebraic over Q because it contains transcendental numbers (e.g., π and e). Therefore, R cannot be the splitting field of any polynomial over Q.
   - **Statement 1 is false.**

2. **Statement 2**: ""There is a field with 60 elements.""
   - The number of elements in a finite field must be a power of a prime (i.e., \( p^n \), where \( p \) is a prime number and \( n \) is a positive integer).
   - 60 is not a power of a prime (it factors as \( 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \)), so there cannot be a field with 60 elements.

1. The given elements are \((2,3)\) and \((3,5)\). In the ring \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \times \mathbb{Z}_9 \), the product is computed component-wise modulo 5 and modulo 9, respectively.

2. For the first component (mod 5): \( 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \). Taking \( 6 \mod 5 \), we get \( 6 - 5 = 1 \). So, the first component of the product is \( 1 \).

3. For the second component (mod 9): \( 3 \cdot 5 = 15 \). Taking \( 15 \mod 9 \), we get \( 15 - 9 = 6 \). So, the second component of the product is \( 6 \).

Thus, the product in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \times \mathbb{Z}_9 \) is \((1,6)\).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine why the set of all real numbers under the usual multiplication operation is not a group, let's analyze step by step:

1. A group must satisfy four properties: closure, associativity, the existence of an identity element, and the existence of inverses for every element.
2. Under multiplication, the set of all real numbers is closed (multiplying two real numbers gives another real number) and associative (multiplication is associative for real numbers). The identity element exists and is 1, as multiplying any real number by 1 gives the same number.
3. However, the issue arises with the existence of inverses. For the number 0, there is no real number that can multiply with 0 to give the identity element (1). Thus, 0 has no multiplicative inverse.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

**Statement 1**: Every group of order \( p^2 \) (where \( p \) is a prime) is Abelian.  
1. By the Sylow theorems, a group of order \( p^2 \) has a center \( Z(G) \) that is non-trivial (since \( |Z(G)| \) divides \( p^2 \) and \( |Z(G)| \geq p \)).
2. If \( |Z(G)| = p^2 \), then \( G \) is Abelian. If \( |Z(G)| = p \), then \( G/Z(G) \) has order \( p \), which is cyclic. A group with a cyclic quotient and a non-trivial center is Abelian.
3. Therefore, every group of order \( p^2 \) is Abelian.  
**Statement 1 is True.**

**Statement 2**: For a fixed prime \( p \), a Sylow \( p \)-subgroup of a group \( G \) is a normal subgroup of \( G \) if and only if it is the only Sylow \( p \)-subgroup of \( G \).  
1. If a Sylow \( p \)-subgroup is the only one, it must be normal because conjugation preserves Sylow \( p \)-subgroups, and there is only one such subgroup.
2. Conversely, if a Sylow \( p \)-subgroup is normal, it is invariant under conjugation, so it cannot have any conjugates. Thus, it must be the only Sylow \( p \)-subgroup.
3. This is a standard result in group theory.  
**Statement 2 is True.**

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

**Statement 1**: For finite groups \( G \) and \( H \), \( |G + H| = |G||H| \).  
- The internal direct product \( G + H \) (or \( G \times H \)) is a group whose order is the product of the orders of \( G \) and \( H \), provided \( G \) and \( H \) are finite groups.  
- This is a standard result in group theory.  
- Therefore, Statement 1 is **True**.

**Statement 2**: If \( r \) divides \( m \) and \( s \) divides \( n \), then \( Z_m + Z_n \) has a subgroup isomorphic to \( Z_r + Z_s \).  
- \( Z_m \) is the cyclic group of order \( m \), and \( Z_n \) is the cyclic group of order \( n \).  
- If \( r \) divides \( m \), then there exists a subgroup of \( Z_m \) isomorphic to \( Z_r \). Similarly, if \( s \) divides \( n \), there exists a subgroup of \( Z_n \) isomorphic to \( Z_s \).  
- The direct product \( Z_m + Z_n \) will then have a subgroup isomorphic to \( Z_r + Z_s \), as subgroups of direct products are formed by taking subgroups of the individual components.  
- Therefore, Statement 2 is **True**.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, I will add the given polynomials \( f(x) = 4x - 5 \) and \( g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 \) in the polynomial ring \( \mathbb{Z}_8[x] \), where coefficients are reduced modulo 8.

1. First, write the polynomials explicitly:
   \( f(x) = 4x - 5 \) and \( g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 \).

2. Add the corresponding terms:
   - The \( x^2 \)-term is \( 0 + 2x^2 = 2x^2 \).
   - The \( x \)-term is \( 4x - 4x = 0x \).
   - The constant term is \( -5 + 2 = -3 \).

3. Reduce each coefficient modulo 8:
   - \( 2x^2 \) remains \( 2x^2 \) (since 2 mod 8 = 2).
   - \( 0x \) remains \( 0x \).
   - \( -3 \mod 8 = 5 \) (since -3 + 8 = 5).

Thus, the resulting polynomial is \( 2x^2 + 5 \).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

**Statement 1**: ""Any set of two vectors in R² is linearly independent.""
1. In R², a set of two vectors is linearly independent if neither vector is a scalar multiple of the other.
2. However, if the two vectors are collinear (one is a scalar multiple of the other), they are linearly dependent.
3. Therefore, not all sets of two vectors in R² are linearly independent. This statement is **false**.

**Statement 2**: ""If V = span(v₁, ..., vₖ) and {v₁, ..., vₖ} are linearly independent, then dim(V) = k.""
1. If {v₁, ..., vₖ} are linearly independent, then they form a basis for the subspace V.
2. The dimension of a subspace is equal to the number of vectors in its basis.
3. Therefore, if {v₁, ..., vₖ} are linearly independent, dim(V) = k. This statement is **true**.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. The nth roots of unity are the complex numbers of the form \( e^{2\pi i k / n} \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 \). These numbers are evenly spaced on the unit circle in the complex plane.

2. Under multiplication, these roots of unity satisfy closure (the product of two nth roots of unity is also an nth root of unity), associativity, and have an identity element (1, which is \( e^{2\pi i \cdot 0 / n} \)).

3. Each nth root of unity also has an inverse (its complex conjugate), which is also an nth root of unity. This satisfies the group property.

4. Additionally, multiplication of complex numbers is commutative, so the set of nth roots of unity forms an abelian group.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correctness of the statements, let's analyze them step by step:

1. **Statement 1**: ""Every maximal ideal is a prime ideal.""
   - A maximal ideal \( I \) in a commutative ring \( R \) is defined as an ideal such that there is no other ideal \( J \) with \( I \subset J \subset R \), except for \( J = I \) or \( J = R \).
   - A prime ideal \( P \) in a commutative ring \( R \) is defined as an ideal such that if \( ab \in P \), then either \( a \in P \) or \( b \in P \).
   - It is a known result in ring theory that every maximal ideal in a commutative ring is a prime ideal. This is because the quotient \( R/I \) (where \( I \) is maximal) is a field, and in a field, the zero ideal is prime. Hence, Statement 1 is **true**.

2. **Statement 2**: ""If \( I \) is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring \( R \), then \( R/I \) is a field.""
   - By definition, if \( I \) is a maximal ideal, the quotient ring \( R/I \) is a field. This is a fundamental property of maximal ideals in commutative rings. Hence, Statement 2 is **true**.

Both statements are true. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Understand the set G**: The set G consists of all \( n \times n \) non-singular (invertible) matrices with rational entries. Non-singular matrices have a determinant that is non-zero, and they are invertible under matrix multiplication.

2. **Group properties**: Under matrix multiplication:
   - Closure: The product of two non-singular matrices is also non-singular.
   - Associativity: Matrix multiplication is associative.
   - Identity: The identity matrix (with rational entries) is in G and acts as the identity element.
   - Inverses: Every non-singular matrix has an inverse that is also non-singular and has rational entries.

   Therefore, G forms a group under matrix multiplication.

3. **Infinite and abelian/non-abelian**:
   - G is infinite because there are infinitely many \( n \times n \) matrices with rational entries.
   - G is non-abelian for \( n > 1 \), as matrix multiplication is not commutative in general for \( n \times n \) matrices.

Thus, G is an **infinite, non-abelian group**.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1**: Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7.
   - By Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups in a group of order 42 must divide the group order (42) and be congruent to 1 modulo 7.
   - The divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. Among these, the only number congruent to 1 modulo 7 is 1.
   - Therefore, there is exactly one Sylow 7-subgroup, and it must be normal. Hence, Statement 1 is **true**.

2. **Statement 2**: Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8.
   - By Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in a group of order 42 must divide the group order (42) and be congruent to 1 modulo 2.
   - The divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. Among these, the numbers congruent to 1 modulo 2 are 1, 3, 7, and 21.
   - It is possible to have more than one Sylow 2-subgroup, so there is no guarantee that a Sylow 2-subgroup (of order 8) is normal. Hence, Statement 2 is **false**.

"To determine whether the polynomial \( 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 9x + 24 \) satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over \( \mathbb{Q} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Recall the Eisenstein criterion**: A polynomial \( f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 \) with integer coefficients satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for a prime \( p \) if:
   - \( p \) divides all coefficients \( a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, \ldots, a_0 \) (all coefficients except the leading coefficient \( a_n \)),
   - \( p \) does not divide the leading coefficient \( a_n \),
   - \( p^2 \) does not divide the constant term \( a_0 \).

2. **Identify the coefficients of the polynomial**: The given polynomial is \( 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 9x + 24 \), so:
   - \( a_3 = 8 \) (leading coefficient),
   - \( a_2 = 6 \),
   - \( a_1 = -9 \),
   - \( a_0 = 24 \) (constant term).

3. **Check for \( p = 2 \)**:
   - \( 2 \) divides \( a_2 = 6 \), \( a_1 = -9 \), and \( a_0 = 24 \),
   - \( 2 \) does not divide \( a_3 = 8 \) (fails this condition),
   - Therefore, \( p = 2 \) does not satisfy the Eisenstein criterion.

4. **Check for \( p = 3 \)**:
   - \( 3 \) divides \( a_2 = 6 \), \( a_1 = -9 \), and \( a_0 = 24 \),
   - \( 3 \) does not divide \( a_3 = 8 \),
   - \( 3^2 = 9 \) does not divide \( a_0 = 24 \),
   - All conditions of the Eisenstein criterion are satisfied for \( p = 3 \).

5. **Check for \( p = 5 \)**:
   - \( 5 \) does not divide \( a_2 = 6 \), \( a_1 = -9 \), or \( a_0 = 24 \),
   - Therefore, \( p = 5 \) does not satisfy the Eisenstein criterion.

6. **Conclusion**: The polynomial satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for \( p = 3 \).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1**: ""The image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism may have 12 elements.""
   - A homomorphism maps elements of one group to another group while preserving the group operation.
   - The image of a homomorphism is a subgroup of the codomain group.
   - By Lagrange's theorem, the order of a subgroup (the image) must divide the order of the group it is a subgroup of.
   - If the original group has 6 elements, the image cannot have 12 elements because 12 does not divide 6. Therefore, this statement is **false**.

2. **Statement 2**: ""There is a homomorphism of some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements.""
   - It is possible to define a homomorphism from a group of 6 elements to a group of 12 elements.
   - For example, consider the trivial homomorphism that maps every element of the group of 6 elements to the identity element of the group of 12 elements.
   - Therefore, this statement is **true**.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1**: The homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic.
   - A cyclic group is generated by a single element. If we apply a homomorphism to this group, the image of the generator will generate the homomorphic image. Thus, the homomorphic image of a cyclic group is also cyclic. This statement is **true**.

2. **Statement 2**: The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian.
   - An Abelian group satisfies the property that the group operation is commutative. A homomorphism preserves the group operation, so the commutative property is also preserved in the homomorphic image. Thus, the homomorphic image of an Abelian group is also Abelian. This statement is **true**.

3. **Conclusion**: Both statements are true.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1**: ""If H is a subgroup of a group G and \( a \) belongs to \( G \), then \( aH = Ha \).""
   - This is not true in general. For a subgroup \( H \) of \( G \), \( aH \) (left coset) and \( Ha \) (right coset) may not be equal unless \( H \) is a normal subgroup of \( G \). Therefore, this statement is **false**.

2. **Statement 2**: ""If H is normal in G and \( a \) belongs to \( G \), then \( ah = ha \) for all \( h \in H \).""
   - This is also not true. The condition for \( H \) being normal in \( G \) is that \( aH = Ha \), but this does not imply that \( ah = ha \) for all \( h \in H \). The elements of \( H \) do not necessarily commute with elements of \( G \). Therefore, this statement is **false**.

"To solve this, let's analyze the given condition step by step:

1. In a group (G, .), the inverse of the product of two elements \( a \) and \( b \) is generally given by \( (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1} \). However, the problem states that \( (ab)^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1} \) for all \( a, b \in G \).

2. For this condition to hold, the group operation must be commutative. This is because the usual property \( (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1} \) relies on the order of the elements, and for \( (ab)^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1} \) to hold, the order of multiplication must not matter. Hence, the group \( G \) must be abelian (commutative).

3. An abelian group is a group in which the operation satisfies the commutative property, i.e., \( ab = ba \) for all \( a, b \in G \).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1**: ""In a finite dimensional vector space every linearly independent set of vectors is contained in a basis.""
   - In a finite-dimensional vector space, any linearly independent set of vectors can be extended to form a basis. This is a fundamental result in linear algebra. Therefore, Statement 1 is **true**.

2. **Statement 2**: ""If \( B_1 \) and \( B_2 \) are bases for the same vector space, then \( |B_1| = |B_2| \).""
   - In a finite-dimensional vector space, all bases have the same number of elements, which is equal to the dimension of the vector space. This is another fundamental result in linear algebra. Therefore, Statement 2 is **true**.

"To solve this, let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the properties of an abelian group**: An abelian group is a group where the operation \( o \) is commutative, i.e., \( g o h = h o g \) for all \( g, h \in G \). This does not impose any restrictions on the elements \( g \) or \( h \) other than commutativity.

2. **Analyze each option**:
   - **Option a**: \( g = g^{-1} \) for every \( g \in G \). This would imply that every element in \( G \) is its own inverse, which is true only for specific groups (e.g., groups of order 2 or groups where every element has order 2). This is not necessarily true for all abelian groups.
   - **Option b**: \( g = g^2 \) for every \( g \in G \). This would imply that \( g \) is the identity element for all \( g \), which is not true for all abelian groups.
   - **Option c**: \( (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 \) for every \( g, h \in G \). Expanding \( (g o h)^2 \) using the group operation, we get \( (g o h) o (g o h) = g o h o g o h \). Since \( G \) is abelian, \( g o h o g o h = g o g o h o h = g^2 o h^2 \). This is true for all abelian groups.
   - **Option d**: \( G \) is of finite order. This is not necessarily true, as abelian groups can be of infinite order (e.g., the group of integers under addition).

**Statement 1**: ""If \( T: V \to W \) is a linear transformation and \( \dim(V) < \dim(W) < 1 \), then \( T \) must be injective.""

1. The condition \( \dim(W) < 1 \) is problematic because dimensions of vector spaces are non-negative integers. Therefore, \( \dim(W) < 1 \) implies \( \dim(W) = 0 \), which means \( W \) is the trivial vector space.
2. If \( W \) is the trivial vector space, then \( T \) maps all vectors in \( V \) to the zero vector in \( W \). This means \( T \) is not injective unless \( V \) is also trivial (i.e., \( \dim(V) = 0 \)).
3. Since \( \dim(V) < \dim(W) \) is given, and \( \dim(W) = 0 \), this condition cannot hold. Thus, the statement is **false**.

**Statement 2**: ""Let \( \dim(V) = n \) and suppose that \( T: V \to V \) is linear. If \( T \) is injective, then it is a bijection.""

1. If \( T \) is a linear transformation from \( V \) to itself and \( \dim(V) = n \), then the rank-nullity theorem applies: \( \dim(V) = \text{rank}(T) + \text{nullity}(T) \).
2. If \( T \) is injective, then \( \text{nullity}(T) = 0 \), which implies \( \text{rank}(T) = n \). This means \( T \) is surjective as well.
3. A linear transformation that is both injective and surjective is a bijection. Therefore, the statement is **true**.

"To solve this, let's proceed step by step:

1. **Understand the field extension**: The field \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \) is the smallest field containing \( \mathbb{Q} \) (the rationals) and the elements \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( \sqrt{3} \). This means it includes all linear combinations of \( 1, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{6} \) with rational coefficients.

2. **Determine the degree of the extension**: The degree of the extension \( [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) : \mathbb{Q}] \) is the dimension of \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \) as a vector space over \( \mathbb{Q} \). Since \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( \sqrt{3} \) are both irrational and algebraic of degree 2 over \( \mathbb{Q} \), and \( \sqrt{6} \) (the product of \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( \sqrt{3} \)) is not in \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \) or \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}) \), the extension is of degree 4.

3. **Verify the basis**: The basis of \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is \( \{1, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{6}\} \), confirming that the degree is indeed 4.

Next, I need to reduce -160 modulo 26. To do this, I find the remainder when -160 is divided by 26.  
Dividing -160 by 26 gives a quotient of -7 and a remainder of 2 (since -160 = -7 * 26 + 2).

"To determine whether the polynomial \( x^2 - 12 \) satisfies Eisenstein's criterion for irreducibility over \( \mathbb{Q} \), we proceed as follows:

   - \( p \) divides all coefficients \( a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, \ldots, a_0 \) (except \( a_n \)),
   - \( p \) does not divide \( a_n \),
   - \( p^2 \) does not divide \( a_0 \).

2. **Analyze the polynomial \( x^2 - 12 \)**:
   - The coefficients are \( a_2 = 1 \), \( a_1 = 0 \), and \( a_0 = -12 \).
   - \( a_2 = 1 \): No prime \( p \) divides \( a_2 \), so this condition is satisfied.
   - \( a_1 = 0 \): Any prime \( p \) divides \( a_1 \), so this condition is satisfied.
   - \( a_0 = -12 \): We need to check whether there exists a prime \( p \) such that \( p \) divides \( -12 \) but \( p^2 \) does not divide \( -12 \).

3. **Check for primes dividing \( -12 \)**:
   - The prime factors of \( -12 \) are \( 2 \), \( 3 \), and \( 5 \).
   - For \( p = 2 \): \( 2 \) divides \( -12 \), but \( 2^2 = 4 \) also divides \( -12 \). Thus, \( p = 2 \) does not satisfy Eisenstein's criterion.
   - For \( p = 3 \): \( 3 \) divides \( -12 \), but \( 3^2 = 9 \) does not divide \( -12 \). Thus, \( p = 3 \) satisfies Eisenstein's criterion.
   - For \( p = 5 \): \( 5 \) does not divide \( -12 \), so \( p = 5 \) does not satisfy Eisenstein's criterion.

4. **Conclusion**: The polynomial \( x^2 - 12 \) satisfies Eisenstein's criterion for irreducibility over \( \mathbb{Q} \) with \( p = 3 \).

Step 1: Check \( g = 1 \). The powers of 1 modulo 7 are \( 1^1 = 1, 1^2 = 1, 1^3 = 1, \dots \). Clearly, \( g = 1 \) does not generate all elements.

- \( 2^2 \mod 7 = 4 \),
- \( 2^3 \mod 7 = 8 \mod 7 = 1 \),
- \( 2^4 \mod 7 = 2 \), and so on.
Since \( g = 2 \) does not generate all elements, it is not a generator.

Step 3: Check \( g = 3 \). The powers of 3 modulo 7 are:
- \( 3^1 \mod 7 = 3 \),
- \( 3^2 \mod 7 = 9 \mod 7 = 2 \),
- \( 3^3 \mod 7 = 27 \mod 7 = 6 \),
- \( 3^4 \mod 7 = 81 \mod 7 = 4 \),
- \( 3^5 \mod 7 = 243 \mod 7 = 5 \),
- \( 3^6 \mod 7 = 729 \mod 7 = 1 \).
Since \( g = 3 \) generates all elements \( \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \), it is a generator.

Step 4: Check \( g = 4 \). The powers of 4 modulo 7 are:
- \( 4^1 \mod 7 = 4 \),
- \( 4^2 \mod 7 = 16 \mod 7 = 2 \),
- \( 4^3 \mod 7 = 64 \mod 7 = 1 \),

\( e + 1 = 0 \).

Step 2: Solve for \( e \):  
\( e = -1 \).

Step 3: Verify that \( e = -1 \) works as the identity element:  
For any \( a \in Z \), \( a * (-1) = a + (-1) + 1 = a \), and \( (-1) * a = (-1) + a + 1 = a \). Thus, \( -1 \) satisfies the identity property.

1. The characteristic of \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is 3, meaning \( 3 \cdot a = 0 \) for all \( a \in \mathbb{Z}_3 \).
2. The characteristic of \( 3\mathbb{Z} \) is 3, meaning \( 3 \cdot b = 0 \) for all \( b \in 3\mathbb{Z} \).
3. Since both components have a characteristic of 3, the characteristic of the direct product \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \times 3\mathbb{Z} \) is also 3.

"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

**Statement 1**: ""Some abelian group of order 45 has a subgroup of order 10.""
1. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, any finite abelian group can be expressed as a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power orders.
2. The order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group (Lagrange's Theorem). Here, the group has order 45 = 3² × 5. A subgroup of order 10 would require the group to have elements of order 10.
3. However, in an abelian group, the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of the cyclic components must divide the group order. Since 10 = 2 × 5, and 2 does not divide 45, it is impossible for an abelian group of order 45 to have a subgroup of order 10.
Thus, **Statement 1 is false**.

**Statement 2**: ""A subgroup \( H \) of a group \( G \) is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of \( H \) is equal to the number of right cosets of \( H \).""
1. By definition, a subgroup \( H \) is normal in \( G \) if \( gH = Hg \) for all \( g \in G \). This implies that the left cosets and right cosets of \( H \) are the same.
2. The number of left cosets of \( H \) is equal to the number of right cosets of \( H \) for any subgroup \( H \), regardless of whether \( H \) is normal. This is because the number of cosets is determined by the index \( |G : H| \), which is the same for both left and right cosets.
3. Therefore, the condition ""number of left cosets equals number of right cosets"" is true for all subgroups, not just normal subgroups. Hence, the statement is **false**.

**Final Answer**: Both statements are false. {'sol': 'b'}"
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1**: ""Every integral domain with characteristic 0 is infinite.""
   - An integral domain is a commutative ring with no zero divisors.
   - If an integral domain has characteristic 0, it means that the additive identity (0) cannot be reached by adding the multiplicative identity (1) to itself finitely many times. This implies that the ring contains a copy of the integers \(\mathbb{Z}\), which is infinite. Therefore, every integral domain with characteristic 0 must be infinite. **Statement 1 is true.**

2. **Statement 2**: ""Every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite.""
   - If an integral domain has prime characteristic \(p\), it means that \(p\) is the smallest positive integer such that \(p \cdot 1 = 0\) (where \(1\) is the multiplicative identity). However, this does not imply that the integral domain is finite. For example, the field of rational functions over \(\mathbb{F}_p\) (the finite field with \(p\) elements) is an infinite integral domain with characteristic \(p\). Therefore, **Statement 2 is false.**

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the given condition**: The condition \( g(f(a)) = a \) for all \( a \in A \) means that applying \( f \) followed by \( g \) brings us back to the original element \( a \). This implies that \( g \) is a ""left inverse"" of \( f \), and \( f \) is injective because no two elements in \( A \) can map to the same element in \( B \) (otherwise, \( g(f(a)) \) would not uniquely return \( a \)).

2. **Statement 1**: Does \( f \) need to be injective? Yes, because if \( f(a_1) = f(a_2) \) for \( a_1, a_2 \in A \), then applying \( g \) would give \( g(f(a_1)) = g(f(a_2)) \), which implies \( a_1 = a_2 \). Thus, \( f \) must be injective.

3. **Statement 2**: Does \( f \) need to be surjective? No, because the condition \( g(f(a)) = a \) only ensures that \( g \) is defined for the image of \( f \), not necessarily for all of \( B \). There could be elements in \( B \) that are not in the image of \( f \), meaning \( f \) does not need to be surjective.

"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1**: ""For any two groups \( G \) and \( G' \), there exists a homomorphism of \( G \) into \( G' \).""
   - A homomorphism is a map \( \phi: G \to G' \) that satisfies \( \phi(xy) = \phi(x)\phi(y) \) for all \( x, y \in G \).
   - However, this statement is not true in general. For example, if \( G \) is a non-trivial group and \( G' \) is the trivial group (containing only the identity element), the only possible homomorphism is the trivial map \( \phi(x) = e' \) for all \( x \in G \), which is not a homomorphism ""into"" \( G' \) in the sense of preserving structure. Thus, Statement 1 is **false**.

2. **Statement 2**: ""Every homomorphism is a one-to-one map.""
   - This is not true. A homomorphism can fail to be injective (one-to-one) if its kernel (the set of elements in \( G \) that map to the identity in \( G' \)) is non-trivial. For example, the map \( \phi: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_n \) given by \( \phi(x) = x \mod n \) is a homomorphism, but it is not one-to-one because all integers congruent modulo \( n \) map to the same element in \( \mathbb{Z}_n \). Thus, Statement 2 is **false**.

Since both statements are false, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1**: A homomorphism may have an empty kernel.  
   - The kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements in the domain that map to the identity element in the codomain. By definition, the kernel always contains at least the identity element of the domain. Therefore, the kernel cannot be empty.  
   - This makes Statement 1 **false**.

2. **Statement 2**: It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group.  
   - A nontrivial homomorphism means there exists at least one element in the domain that does not map to the identity in the codomain. It is possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism from a finite group to an infinite group. For example, consider the cyclic group \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) (a finite group) and the group of integers \( \mathbb{Z} \) (an infinite group). A homomorphism can map the generator of \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) to 1 in \( \mathbb{Z} \), which is nontrivial.  
   - This makes Statement 2 **false**.

"To determine which values of \( c \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) make \( \mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) \) a field, we need to check when the polynomial \( x^3 + x^2 + c \) is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understand the structure**: \( \mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) \) is a field if and only if the polynomial \( x^3 + x^2 + c \) is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). A polynomial is irreducible if it cannot be factored into polynomials of lower degree over \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

2. **Check for reducibility**: A cubic polynomial \( x^3 + x^2 + c \) is reducible if it has a root in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) or if it can be factored into a product of a linear polynomial and a quadratic polynomial over \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

3. **Test for roots**: The possible roots of \( x^3 + x^2 + c \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) are \( 0, 1, \) and \( 2 \). Substitute these values into \( x^3 + x^2 + c \) for each \( c \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) (\( c = 0, 1, 2 \)):

   - For \( c = 0 \): \( x^3 + x^2 + 0 = x^2(x + 1) \). This is reducible because it factors as \( x^2(x + 1) \).
   - For \( c = 1 \): \( x^3 + x^2 + 1 \). Test roots:
     - \( x = 0 \): \( 0^3 + 0^2 + 1 = 1 \neq 0 \),
     - \( x = 1 \): \( 1^3 + 1^2 + 1 = 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \),
     - \( x = 2 \): \( 2^3 + 2^2 + 1 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \neq 0 \).
     Thus, \( x = 1 \) is a root, so \( x^3 + x^2 + 1 \) is reducible.
   - For \( c = 2 \): \( x^3 + x^2 + 2 \). Test roots:
     - \( x = 0 \): \( 0^3 + 0^2 + 2 = 2 \neq 0 \),
     - \( x = 1 \): \( 1^3 + 1^2 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \neq 0 \),
     - \( x = 2 \): \( 2^3 + 2^2 + 2 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \neq 0 \).
     Since \( x^3 + x^2 + 2 \) has no roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), it is irreducible.

4. **Conclusion**: The polynomial \( x^3 + x^2 + c \) is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) only when \( c = 2 \). Therefore, \( \mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) \) is a field only for \( c = 2 \).

"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1**: If \( R \) is an integral domain, then \( R[x] \) (the ring of polynomials over \( R \)) is also an integral domain.
   - An integral domain is a commutative ring with no zero divisors.
   - If \( R \) is an integral domain, then \( R[x] \) inherits the property of having no zero divisors. This is because the product of two non-zero polynomials in \( R[x] \) will also be non-zero, as the leading term of the product is the product of the leading terms of the two polynomials, which are non-zero in \( R \). Hence, \( R[x] \) is an integral domain.
   - Therefore, Statement 1 is **True**.

2. **Statement 2**: If \( R \) is a ring and \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are in \( R[x] \), then \( \deg(f(x)g(x)) = \deg(f(x)) + \deg(g(x)) \).
   - The degree of the product of two polynomials is the sum of their degrees **only if the leading coefficients of both polynomials are non-zero**. However, if \( R \) is not an integral domain (e.g., if \( R \) has zero divisors), it is possible for the leading coefficient of the product \( f(x)g(x) \) to become zero, which would reduce the degree of the product.
   - Since the statement does not specify that \( R \) is an integral domain, this equality does not always hold.
   - Therefore, Statement 2 is **False**.

"To solve this, we need to determine the maximum possible order of an element in the group \( \mathbb{Z}_8 \times \mathbb{Z}_{10} \times \mathbb{Z}_{24} \). Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understand the order of an element in a direct product**: The order of an element \((a, b, c)\) in \( \mathbb{Z}_8 \times \mathbb{Z}_{10} \times \mathbb{Z}_{24} \) is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in their respective groups.

2. **Determine the possible orders in each group**:
   - In \( \mathbb{Z}_8 \), the possible orders are \(1, 2, 4, 8\).
   - In \( \mathbb{Z}_{10} \), the possible orders are \(1, 2, 5, 10\).
   - In \( \mathbb{Z}_{24} \), the possible orders are \(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\).

3. **Find the maximum LCM**:
   - To maximize the order of \((a, b, c)\), we need to maximize the LCM of the orders of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
   - The maximum order in \( \mathbb{Z}_8 \) is \(8\), in \( \mathbb{Z}_{10} \) is \(10\), and in \( \mathbb{Z}_{24} \) is \(24\).
   - The LCM of \(8\), \(10\), and \(24\) is calculated as follows:
     - The prime factorizations are:
       - \(8 = 2^3\),
       - \(10 = 2 \cdot 5\),
       - \(24 = 2^3 \cdot 3\).
     - The LCM takes the highest power of each prime:
       - For \(2\), the highest power is \(2^3 = 8\),
       - For \(3\), the highest power is \(3\),
       - For \(5\), the highest power is \(5\).
     - Thus, \(\text{LCM}(8, 10, 24) = 2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 120\).

4. **Conclusion**: The maximum possible order of an element in \( \mathbb{Z}_8 \times \mathbb{Z}_{10} \times \mathbb{Z}_{24} \) is \(120\).

1. **Understand the problem**: A quotient ring \( \mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(f(x)) \) is a field if and only if \( f(x) \) is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). This means \( f(x) \) cannot be factored into non-constant polynomials of lower degree over \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

"To determine the identity element in the group \( G = \{2, 4, 6, 8\} \) under multiplication modulo 10, we need to find the element \( e \) such that for every \( a \in G \), \( a \cdot e \equiv a \pmod{10} \).

1. Start by testing each element in \( G \) to see if it satisfies the identity property:
   - For \( e = 2 \): Check \( 2 \cdot 2 \mod 10 = 4 \neq 2 \), so 2 is not the identity.

1. For \( \mathbb{Z}_r + \mathbb{Z}_s \) to be isomorphic to a subgroup of \( \mathbb{Z}_m + \mathbb{Z}_n \), the orders of the cyclic components must divide the orders of the corresponding components in the larger group.

"To determine the generator of the finite field \( \mathbb{Z}_{11} \), we need to find an element \( g \) such that its powers modulo 11 generate all the nonzero elements of \( \mathbb{Z}_{11} \). This means \( g^k \mod 11 \) (for \( k = 1, 2, \dots, 10 \)) should produce all integers from 1 to 10 without repetition.

Step 1: Test \( g = 1 \). The powers of 1 modulo 11 are always 1, so it does not generate all elements.

Step 2: Test \( g = 2 \). Compute \( 2^k \mod 11 \) for \( k = 1, 2, \dots, 10 \):
- \( 2^1 \mod 11 = 2 \)
- \( 2^2 \mod 11 = 4 \)

- \( 3^1 \mod 11 = 3 \)

**Statement 1: Every group of order 159 is cyclic.**
1. The order of the group is 159. We check if 159 is a product of two coprime prime numbers. Indeed, \( 159 = 3 \times 53 \), where 3 and 53 are prime and coprime to each other.
2. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups is \( 1 \mod 3 \) and divides \( 159 / 3 = 53 \). Hence, there is exactly 1 Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal.
3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 53-subgroups is \( 1 \mod 53 \) and divides \( 159 / 53 = 3 \). Hence, there is exactly 1 Sylow 53-subgroup, which is normal.

**Statement 2: Every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.**
1. The order of the group is 102. We check its prime factorization: \( 102 = 2 \times 3 \times 17 \), where 2, 3, and 17 are prime.
2. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 17-subgroups is \( 1 \mod 17 \) and divides \( 102 / 17 = 6 \). Hence, there is exactly 1 Sylow 17-subgroup, which is normal.

   - A subring of a ring does not necessarily have the same unity as the ring. For example, consider the ring \( \mathbb{Z} \) (integers) and its subring \( 2\mathbb{Z} \) (even integers). The ring \( \mathbb{Z} \) has unity 1, but \( 2\mathbb{Z} \) does not have a unity that is the same as \( \mathbb{Z} \)'s unity. Therefore, this statement is **false**.

2. **Statement 2**: ""Every field is an integral domain.""
   - A field is a commutative ring with unity where every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. Additionally, fields have no zero divisors. Since an integral domain is defined as a commutative ring with unity and no zero divisors, every field satisfies the definition of an integral domain. Therefore, this statement is **true**.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the truth of the statements, let's analyze them step by step:

**Statement 1**: The set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant is a group under matrix multiplication.

1. A group must satisfy four properties: closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.
2. Closure: If two 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinants are multiplied, the result is a 2 x 2 matrix with integer entries. However, the determinant of the product may not remain nonzero (e.g., if the determinant of one matrix is 2 and the determinant of the other is 1/2, the product's determinant is 1, which is valid, but this does not always hold for all cases). Thus, closure is not guaranteed.
3. Inverses: For a matrix with a nonzero determinant, the inverse matrix may not have integer entries (e.g., if the determinant is 2, the inverse involves dividing by 2, which may result in non-integer entries). Hence, inverses are not guaranteed to exist within the set.
4. Therefore, **Statement 1 is false**.

**Statement 2**: The set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 is a group under matrix multiplication.

1. Closure: If two 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 are multiplied, the result is a 2 x 2 matrix with integer entries, and the determinant of the product is also 1 (since the determinant of a product is the product of the determinants). Thus, closure holds.
2. Associativity: Matrix multiplication is associative, so this property is satisfied.
3. Identity: The identity matrix (with determinant 1) is a 2 x 2 matrix with integer entries, so the identity element exists in the set.
4. Inverses: If a 2 x 2 matrix has integer entries and determinant 1, its inverse also has integer entries and determinant 1. Thus, inverses exist within the set.
5. Therefore, **Statement 2 is true**.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

**Statement 1**: Every quotient ring of every commutative ring is again a commutative ring.  
1. A quotient ring is formed by taking a commutative ring \( R \) and an ideal \( I \), and constructing \( R/I \).  
2. The operations in \( R/I \) are defined based on the operations in \( R \), and the commutativity of \( R \) ensures that \( R/I \) is also commutative.  
3. Therefore, this statement is **true**.

**Statement 2**: An ideal \( N \) in a ring \( R \) with unity \( 1 \) is all of \( R \) if and only if \( 1 \in N \).  
1. If \( 1 \in N \), then for any \( r \in R \), \( r = r \cdot 1 \in N \) (since \( N \) is an ideal and closed under multiplication by elements of \( R \)). Thus, \( N = R \).  
2. Conversely, if \( N = R \), then \( 1 \in R = N \).  
3. Therefore, this statement is also **true**.

Both statements are true. The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the properties of the relation ~ = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 2)} on the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4} step by step:

1. **Reflexive**: A relation is reflexive if every element in the set A is related to itself, i.e., (a, a) ∈ ~ for all a ∈ A. Here, we do not have (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), or (4, 4) in ~. Therefore, ~ is not reflexive.

2. **Symmetric**: A relation is symmetric if (a, b) ∈ ~ implies (b, a) ∈ ~. For example, since (1, 2) ∈ ~, we would need (2, 1) ∈ ~ for symmetry. However, (2, 1) is not in ~. Therefore, ~ is not symmetric.

3. **Anti-symmetric**: A relation is anti-symmetric if (a, b) ∈ ~ and (b, a) ∈ ~ imply a = b. Here, there are no pairs (a, b) and (b, a) in ~ where a ≠ b. Thus, ~ is anti-symmetric.

4. **Transitive**: A relation is transitive if (a, b) ∈ ~ and (b, c) ∈ ~ imply (a, c) ∈ ~. In this case:
   - (1, 2) and (4, 2) are in ~, but there is no (1, 4) or (4, 1) in ~.
   - (1, 2) and (1, 3) do not lead to any new pairs.
   Therefore, ~ is not transitive.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's proceed step by step:

1. **Understand the problem**: A homomorphism is a function \( f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_2 \) that preserves the group operation. Here, \( \mathbb{Z} \) is the group of integers under addition, and \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) is the group of integers modulo 2 under addition.

2. **Key property of homomorphisms**: For any homomorphism \( f \), we must have \( f(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \) (mod 2). The image of \( f \) must be a subgroup of \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \). Since \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) has only two elements (0 and 1), its subgroups are \( \{0\} \) and \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) itself.

3. **Determine possible homomorphisms**:
   - If \( f(1) = 0 \), then \( f(n) = 0 \) for all \( n \in \mathbb{Z} \), because \( f(n) = f(1 + 1 + \dots + 1) = 0 + 0 + \dots + 0 = 0 \). This gives the trivial homomorphism.
   - If \( f(1) = 1 \), then \( f(n) = n \mod 2 \), because \( f(n) = f(1 + 1 + \dots + 1) = 1 + 1 + \dots + 1 = n \mod 2 \). This gives the non-trivial homomorphism.

4. **Count the homomorphisms**: There are exactly two homomorphisms: the trivial one (mapping all integers to 0) and the non-trivial one (mapping \( n \) to \( n \mod 2 \)).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1: Every field is also a ring.**
   - A field is a set equipped with two operations (addition and multiplication) satisfying certain properties, including the existence of additive and multiplicative identities, and every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.
   - A ring is a set with two operations (addition and multiplication) satisfying properties such as associativity, distributivity, and the existence of an additive identity. However, a ring does not necessarily require every nonzero element to have a multiplicative inverse.
   - Since a field satisfies all the properties of a ring (and more), every field is indeed a ring. **This statement is true.**

2. **Statement 2: Every ring has a multiplicative identity.**
   - A ring does not necessarily have a multiplicative identity. For example, there are rings called ""rings without unity"" that do not have a multiplicative identity. Hence, this statement is **false**.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

**Statement 1**: ""If \( R \) is a ring and \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are in \( R[x] \), then \( \deg(f(x) + g(x)) = \max(\deg(f(x)), \deg(g(x))) \).""

1. The degree of the sum of two polynomials depends on the leading terms of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \). If the leading terms cancel out (e.g., their coefficients sum to zero), the degree of \( f(x) + g(x) \) can be less than \( \max(\deg(f(x)), \deg(g(x))) \).
2. Therefore, this statement is **false** because the degree of the sum is not always equal to the maximum of the degrees of the two polynomials.

**Statement 2**: ""If \( F \) is a field, then every ideal of \( F[x] \) is principal.""

1. In the ring of polynomials \( F[x] \) over a field \( F \), every ideal is generated by a single polynomial. This is a well-known result in abstract algebra, as \( F[x] \) is a principal ideal domain (PID) when \( F \) is a field.
2. Therefore, this statement is **true**.

**Conclusion**: Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is true. The correct answer is:

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the conditions for a subset \( H \) of a group \( (G, *) \) to itself be a group:

1. **Step 1**: A subset \( H \) must be closed under the group operation \( * \). This means that for all \( a, b \in H \), \( a * b \in H \). This ensures that the operation \( * \) is well-defined within \( H \).

2. **Step 2**: A subset \( H \) must contain the identity element of the group \( G \). The identity element is necessary for \( H \) to satisfy the group axioms.

3. **Step 3**: A subset \( H \) must be closed under inverses. This means that for every \( a \in H \), the inverse \( a^{-1} \in H \). This ensures that every element in \( H \) has an inverse within \( H \).

4. **Step 4**: Combining these conditions, the correct answer must include closure under the group operation, closure under inverses, and the presence of the identity element.

Now, let's evaluate the given choices:

- **a)** \( a, b \in H \Rightarrow a * b \in H \): This ensures closure under the group operation, but it does not guarantee the presence of the identity element or closure under inverses. This alone is insufficient.

- **b)** \( a \in H \Rightarrow a^{-1} \in H \): This ensures closure under inverses, but it does not guarantee closure under the group operation or the presence of the identity element. This alone is insufficient.

- **c)** \( a, b \in H \Rightarrow a * b^{-1} \in H \): This condition implies closure under the group operation and closure under inverses (since \( b^{-1} \in H \) if \( b \in H \)). It also indirectly ensures the presence of the identity element (by taking \( a = b \)). This condition is sufficient for \( H \) to be a group.

- **d)** \( H \) contains the identity element: This is necessary but not sufficient on its own, as it does not guarantee closure under the group operation or inverses.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I will proceed step by step:

1. **Understand the problem**: We are tasked with factoring \( x^4 + 4 \) into linear factors over \( \mathbb{Z}_5[x] \), which means we are working modulo 5. The possible values for coefficients are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

2. **Rewrite the polynomial**: In \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), \( 4 \equiv -1 \mod 5 \). So, \( x^4 + 4 \equiv x^4 - 1 \mod 5 \). This is a difference of squares: \( x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) \).

3. **Factor further**: 
   - \( x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1) \).
   - \( x^2 + 1 \) needs to be checked for further factorization. In \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), \( x^2 + 1 = 0 \) implies \( x^2 \equiv -1 \equiv 4 \mod 5 \). The solutions are \( x \equiv 2 \mod 5 \) and \( x \equiv -2 \equiv 3 \mod 5 \). Thus, \( x^2 + 1 = (x - 2)(x + 2) \).

4. **Combine all factors**: Substituting back, we have \( x^4 + 4 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x - 2)(x + 2) \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5[x] \).

5. **Match with the choices**: The correct factorization is \( (x - 2)(x + 2)(x - 1)(x + 1) \).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1**: ""There exists a free abelian group of every positive integer rank.""
   - A free abelian group is a group that has a basis such that every element of the group can be uniquely expressed as a finite linear combination of basis elements with integer coefficients.
   - For any positive integer \( n \), the free abelian group of rank \( n \) is isomorphic to \( \mathbb{Z}^n \), where \( \mathbb{Z}^n \) is the direct sum of \( n \) copies of \( \mathbb{Z} \).
   - Therefore, there indeed exists a free abelian group of every positive integer rank.
   - **Statement 1 is true.**

2. **Statement 2**: ""A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set.""
   - The Betti number of a finitely generated abelian group refers to the rank of its free part (i.e., the number of copies of \( \mathbb{Z} \) in its decomposition).
   - A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if it has no torsion elements (i.e., elements of finite order).
   - If the Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set, this implies that the group is free abelian because the group can be expressed as a direct sum of \( \mathbb{Z} \) copies, with no torsion part.
   - **Statement 2 is true.**

Thus, both statements are true.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, we need to find the inverse of an element \( a \) in the group \( (Z, *) \) under the operation \( a * b = a + b + 1 \). The inverse of \( a \), denoted as \( a^{-1} \), satisfies the property:

\[
a * a^{-1} = e
\]

where \( e \) is the identity element of the group. Let's proceed step by step:

1. **Find the identity element \( e \):**
   The identity element satisfies \( a * e = a \) for all \( a \in Z \). Using the operation \( a * b = a + b + 1 \), we substitute \( b = e \):
   \[
   a * e = a + e + 1 = a
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   e + 1 = 0 \implies e = -1
   \]
   So, the identity element is \( e = -1 \).

2. **Set up the equation for the inverse:**
   The inverse \( a^{-1} \) satisfies \( a * a^{-1} = e \). Substituting the operation \( a * b = a + b + 1 \) and \( e = -1 \), we have:
   \[
   a + a^{-1} + 1 = -1
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   a + a^{-1} = -2
   \]
   \[
   a^{-1} = -2 - a
   \]

3. **Verify the options:**
   The inverse of \( a \) is \( -2 - a \). Among the given choices:
   - Option (b): \( -2 \) is incorrect.
   - Option (c): \( a - 2 \) is incorrect.
   - Option (d): \( (2 + a) * -1 \) simplifies to \( -2 - a \), which is correct.

1. **Understand the field extension**: The field extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}\sqrt{3}) \) is generated by the element \( \sqrt{2}\sqrt{3} \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \). We need to determine the degree of this extension.

2. **Check the minimal polynomial**: The degree of the field extension is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial of \( \sqrt{2}\sqrt{3} \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \). Note that \( \sqrt{2}\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{6} \), so we are essentially working with \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6}) \).

3. **Determine the degree of \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \)**: The minimal polynomial of \( \sqrt{6} \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is \( x^2 - 6 \), which is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Q} \) (since 6 is not a perfect square). Therefore, the degree of the extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is 2.

Thus, the degree of the field extension is 2.

"First, Fermat's Little Theorem states that if \( p \) is a prime number and \( a \) is an integer not divisible by \( p \), then \( a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \). Here, \( p = 23 \) and \( a = 3 \), so \( 3^{22} \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

Next, to find \( 3^{47} \mod 23 \), we can write \( 47 = 22 \times 2 + 3 \). Thus, \( 3^{47} = (3^{22})^2 \cdot 3^3 \). Using Fermat's theorem, \( 3^{22} \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \), so \( (3^{22})^2 \equiv 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

Finally, this simplifies \( 3^{47} \equiv 1 \cdot 3^3 \pmod{23} \). Calculating \( 3^3 = 27 \), and \( 27 \mod 23 = 4 \). Therefore, the remainder is 4.

"To determine the characteristic of the ring \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \), we proceed as follows:

2. In \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the characteristic is 3 because \( 3 \cdot 1 = 0 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \).
3. Since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is the direct product of two copies of \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the characteristic of the product ring is the least common multiple (LCM) of the characteristics of the individual rings.
4. The LCM of 3 and 3 is 3.

Thus, the characteristic of \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is 3.

1. In a general group, it is not necessarily true that \(a^2 \neq b^2\) if \(a \neq b\). For example, in the group \(\mathbb{Z}_n\) (integers modulo \(n\)), it is possible for \(a \neq b\) but \(a^2 = b^2\) (e.g., in \(\mathbb{Z}_6\), \(2^2 = 4\) and \(4^2 = 4\), even though \(2 \neq 4\)).
2. Therefore, Statement 1 is **false**.

**Statement 2**: ""The set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup.""
1. A dihedral group \(D_n\) consists of \(n\) rotations and \(n\) reflections. The set of rotations in \(D_n\) forms a subgroup of order \(n\).
2. This subgroup is cyclic because the rotations can be generated by a single rotation (e.g., a rotation by \(360^\circ/n\)).

"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

**Statement 1: In a group (ab)^{-2} = b^{-2}a^{-2}.**

1. In a group, the inverse of a product (ab) is given by (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}.
2. Squaring the inverse, we get (ab)^{-2} = [(ab)^{-1}]^2 = (b^{-1}a^{-1})^2.
3. Expanding this, (b^{-1}a^{-1})^2 = b^{-1}a^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1}, which is not equal to b^{-2}a^{-2} in general.
4. Therefore, Statement 1 is **false**.

**Statement 2: In a group (ab)^n = a^n b^n.**

1. In general, (ab)^n in a group is not equal to a^n b^n unless the group is abelian (commutative).
2. For non-abelian groups, (ab)^n expands differently due to the non-commutativity of the group operation.

1. The symmetric group \( S_n \) consists of all permutations of \( n \) elements.

3. For \( n \geq 3 \), \( S_n \) is non-Abelian because there exist permutations that do not commute. For example, in \( S_3 \), the permutations \( (1\ 2) \) and \( (2\ 3) \) do not commute.
4. Therefore, Statement 1 is **true**.

**Statement 2**: ""If \( a \) is a permutation that is an \( m \)-cycle and \( b \) is a permutation that is an \( n \)-cycle, then \( |ab| = \text{lcm}(m, n) \).""
1. The order of a product of two permutations \( a \) and \( b \) depends on whether \( a \) and \( b \) are disjoint cycles or not.
2. If \( a \) and \( b \) are disjoint cycles, then \( |ab| = \text{lcm}(m, n) \). However, if \( a \) and \( b \) are not disjoint, the order of \( ab \) is generally not \( \text{lcm}(m, n) \).
3. The statement does not specify whether \( a \) and \( b \) are disjoint, so it is not always true.
4. Therefore, Statement 2 is **false**.

"To determine the characteristic of the ring \( \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \), we proceed as follows:

1. The characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( n \cdot (a, b) = (0, 0) \) for all \( (a, b) \in \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \), where \( n \cdot (a, b) \) means adding \( (a, b) \) to itself \( n \) times.

2. In \( \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \), the addition is component-wise. So, \( n \cdot (a, b) = (n \cdot a, n \cdot b) \). For this to equal \( (0, 0) \), we need \( n \cdot a = 0 \) and \( n \cdot b = 0 \) for all integers \( a \) and \( b \).

3. In \( \mathbb{Z} \), the only \( n \) that satisfies \( n \cdot a = 0 \) for all \( a \) is \( n = 0 \). Therefore, the characteristic of \( \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \) is 0.

2. For multiplication modulo \( n \), the set \( \{1, 2, \dots, n-1\} \) does not always satisfy invertibility. For example, if \( n = 4 \), the set is \( \{1, 2, 3\} \). Here, \( 2 \cdot 2 = 4 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \), so \( 2 \) does not have an inverse modulo \( 4 \).  
3. Therefore, the set \( \{1, 2, \dots, n-1\} \) is not always a group under multiplication modulo \( n \).  
**Statement 1 is False.**

**Statement 2**: There is an integer \( x \) such that \( 63x \mod 100 = 1 \).  
1. This means we need to check if \( 63 \) and \( 100 \) are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1).  
2. The gcd of \( 63 \) and \( 100 \) is 1 because \( 63 = 3^2 \cdot 7 \) and \( 100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2 \), and they share no common prime factors.  
3. Since \( \gcd(63, 100) = 1 \), by Bezout's lemma, there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( 63x \equiv 1 \mod 100 \).

   - For example, \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is cyclic because 2 and 3 are coprime, but \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_4 \) is not cyclic because 2 and 4 are not coprime.

2. **Statement 2**: ""The external direct product of \( D_3 \) and \( D_4 \) is isomorphic to \( D_{12} \).""
   - \( D_3 \) is the dihedral group of order 6, and \( D_4 \) is the dihedral group of order 8.
   - The external direct product \( D_3 \times D_4 \) has order \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \).
   - \( D_{12} \) is the dihedral group of order 24.
   - Since the orders of \( D_3 \times D_4 \) and \( D_{12} \) are different (48 vs. 24), they cannot be isomorphic.

Since the group is free, we can permute and scale the basis elements (by ±1), leading to an infinite number of distinct bases. Thus, Statement 1 is **true**.

2. **Statement 2**: ""Every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases.""

Thus, both statements are true.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the truth of the statements, let's analyze them step by step:

**Statement 1**: If a group has an element of order 10, then it has elements of orders 1, 2, and 5.  
1. By definition, the order of an element \( g \) in a group is the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( g^n = e \), where \( e \) is the identity element.  
2. If an element \( g \) has order 10, then the cyclic subgroup generated by \( g \) contains elements of all orders that divide 10 (by Lagrange's theorem).  
3. The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. Hence, the group must have elements of orders 1, 2, and 5.  
Thus, **Statement 1 is true**.

**Statement 2**: If a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it has an element of order 6.  
1. If a group has an element of order 2, say \( a \), and an element of order 3, say \( b \), it does not necessarily mean that there exists an element of order 6.  
2. For example, consider the Klein four-group \( V_4 = \{e, a, b, ab\} \), where \( a^2 = e \), \( b^2 = e \), and \( ab = ba \). This group has elements of order 2 but no element of order 6.  
3. The existence of an element of order 6 depends on whether the group is cyclic or whether the elements \( a \) and \( b \) commute and generate a cyclic subgroup of order 6.  
Thus, **Statement 2 is false**.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the given condition**:  
   The condition \( g(f(a)) = a \) for all \( a \in A \) implies that \( g \) is a ""left inverse"" of \( f \). This means that \( f \) is injective (one-to-one), and \( g \) maps back every element of \( f(A) \subseteq B \) to its corresponding element in \( A \).

2. **Analyzing Statement 1 (g must necessarily be injective)**:  
   For \( g \) to be injective, if \( g(b_1) = g(b_2) \), then \( b_1 \) must equal \( b_2 \). However, the condition \( g(f(a)) = a \) does not guarantee that \( g \) is injective for all \( b \in B \). For example, if \( b \notin f(A) \), \( g(b) \) is not constrained by the condition. Thus, \( g \) does not necessarily have to be injective.  

3. **Analyzing Statement 2 (g must necessarily be surjective)**:  
   For \( g \) to be surjective, every element of \( A \) must be in the image of \( g \). The condition \( g(f(a)) = a \) ensures that every \( a \in A \) is mapped to by \( g \) (via \( f(a) \in B \)). Therefore, \( g \) must necessarily be surjective.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1**: A homomorphism is one-to-one (injective) if and only if the kernel consists of the identity element alone.
   - A homomorphism \( f: G \to H \) is injective if \( \ker(f) = \{e_G\} \), where \( e_G \) is the identity element of \( G \). This is a standard result in group theory. Hence, Statement 1 is **true**.

2. **Statement 2**: The image of a group of 6 elements under some homomorphism may have 4 elements.
   - By the First Isomorphism Theorem, the order of the image of a homomorphism must divide the order of the original group. Since the original group has 6 elements, the possible orders of the image are divisors of 6: \( 1, 2, 3, \) or \( 6 \). However, \( 4 \) is not a divisor of \( 6 \), so it is **not possible** for the image to have 4 elements. Hence, Statement 2 is **false**.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correctness of the statements, let's analyze them step by step:

**Statement 1**: If \( H \) and \( K \) are subgroups of a group \( G \), then \( |HK| = \frac{|H||K|}{|H \cap K|} \).

1. This is a standard result in group theory. The formula \( |HK| = \frac{|H||K|}{|H \cap K|} \) holds when \( H \) and \( K \) are finite subgroups of a group \( G \). It is derived from the fact that the number of distinct cosets of \( H \cap K \) in \( H \) and \( K \) determines the size of \( HK \).
2. Therefore, **Statement 1 is true**.

**Statement 2**: A group of order \( 2p \), where \( p \) is an odd prime, is cyclic or isomorphic to \( D_p \) (the dihedral group of order \( 2p \)).

1. By the Sylow theorems, a group of order \( 2p \) has a unique Sylow \( p \)-subgroup, which is normal. Depending on the structure of the group, it can either be cyclic (isomorphic to \( \mathbb{Z}_{2p} \)) or isomorphic to the dihedral group \( D_p \), which is the group of symmetries of a regular \( p \)-gon.
2. This is a well-known result in group theory, and hence **Statement 2 is true**.

**Conclusion**: Both statements are true.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, I need to determine the function \( T(x, y) \) based on the given information and then calculate \( T(-3, 2) \).

1. From the problem, \( T(1, 0) = 3 \). This suggests that the function \( T(x, y) \) depends on \( x \) and \( y \), and the coefficient of \( x \) is likely 3.
2. Similarly, \( T(0, 1) = -5 \). This suggests that the coefficient of \( y \) is likely -5.
3. Combining these, the function \( T(x, y) \) can be expressed as \( T(x, y) = 3x - 5y \).
4. Now, substitute \( x = -3 \) and \( y = 2 \) into the function: 
   \[
   T(-3, 2) = 3(-3) - 5(2) = -9 - 10 = -19.
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand that Z_24 is the ring of integers modulo 24. This means that any operation performed in this ring will result in a value reduced modulo 24.

Step 1: Compute the product of 12 and 16.  
12 × 16 = 192.

Step 2: Reduce 192 modulo 24.  
192 ÷ 24 = 8 with a remainder of 0. Thus, 192 ≡ 0 (mod 24).

Step 3: The result of the product (12)(16) in Z_24 is 0.  

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1**: ""Every permutation is a one-to-one function.""
   - A permutation is a rearrangement of elements in a set, which means each element in the domain is mapped to a unique element in the codomain. This satisfies the definition of a one-to-one function (injective function). Therefore, Statement 1 is **True**.

2. **Statement 2**: ""Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one-to-one.""
   - For a function to be a permutation, it must not only be one-to-one (injective) but also onto (surjective), meaning every element in the codomain must be mapped by some element in the domain. A function being one-to-one alone does not guarantee that it is a permutation. Therefore, Statement 2 is **False**.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1**: If a finite group has order \( n \), then the group contains a subgroup of order \( d \) for every positive divisor \( d \) of \( n \).  
   - This is a direct result of **Lagrange's theorem**, which states that the order of any subgroup of a finite group divides the order of the group. However, Lagrange's theorem does not guarantee the existence of a subgroup for every divisor \( d \) of \( n \). For example, there are groups (like the alternating group \( A_4 \)) where not all divisors of the group order correspond to subgroups.  
   - Therefore, **Statement 1 is false**.

2. **Statement 2**: If \( a \) belongs to a finite group, then \( |a| \) (the order of the element \( a \)) divides \( |G| \) (the order of the group).  
   - This is true because the order of an element \( a \) in a finite group is the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( a^m = e \) (the identity element). By Lagrange's theorem, the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by \( a \) (which is \( |a| \)) divides the order of the group \( |G| \).  
   - Therefore, **Statement 2 is true**.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's proceed step by step:

1. **Understand the problem**: We are tasked with finding all cosets of the subgroup \( 4\mathbb{Z} \) in \( 2\mathbb{Z} \). Here, \( 4\mathbb{Z} \) is the set of all integers that are multiples of 4, and \( 2\mathbb{Z} \) is the set of all integers that are multiples of 2.

2. **Coset definition**: A coset of \( 4\mathbb{Z} \) in \( 2\mathbb{Z} \) is of the form \( a + 4\mathbb{Z} \), where \( a \in 2\mathbb{Z} \). Since \( a \) must be in \( 2\mathbb{Z} \), \( a \) can only be even integers.

3. **Determine distinct cosets**: 
   - If \( a = 0 \), the coset is \( 0 + 4\mathbb{Z} = 4\mathbb{Z} \).
   - If \( a = 2 \), the coset is \( 2 + 4\mathbb{Z} \), which consists of all integers of the form \( 2 + 4k \) (where \( k \in \mathbb{Z} \)).
   - No other distinct cosets exist because any even integer \( a \in 2\mathbb{Z} \) will either be a multiple of 4 (and thus in \( 4\mathbb{Z} \)) or of the form \( 2 + 4k \).

4. **Conclusion**: The distinct cosets of \( 4\mathbb{Z} \) in \( 2\mathbb{Z} \) are \( 4\mathbb{Z} \) and \( 2 + 4\mathbb{Z} \).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each statement step by step:

a) Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.  
- An equivalence relation satisfies reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.  
- A partial-ordering relation satisfies reflexivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity.  
- Since symmetry and antisymmetry are mutually exclusive, an equivalence relation cannot be a partial-ordering relation.  
- This statement is **false**.

b) Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B = {1, 2}, is 64.  
- The number of relations from set A to set B is given by \( 2^{|A| \cdot |B|} \).  
- Here, \( |A| = 3 \) and \( |B| = 2 \), so the number of relations is \( 2^{3 \cdot 2} = 2^6 = 64 \).  
- This statement is **true**.

c) Empty relation is reflexive.  
- A relation is reflexive if every element in the set is related to itself.  
- The empty relation does not relate any elements, so it cannot be reflexive.  
- This statement is **false**.

d) Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.  
- A symmetric relation means if \( (a, b) \) is in the relation, then \( (b, a) \) must also be in the relation.  
- An un-symmetric relation means it is not symmetric, but this does not imply the two properties are exact negatives of each other.  
- This statement is **false**.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I will determine the maximum possible order of an element in the symmetric group \( S_6 \), which is the least common multiple (LCM) of the cycle lengths in a disjoint cycle decomposition of a permutation.

1. The order of a permutation in \( S_n \) is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the disjoint cycles in its cycle decomposition. To maximize the order, we need to maximize the LCM of the cycle lengths while ensuring the sum of the cycle lengths equals \( n = 6 \).

2. The possible cycle decompositions of 6 are:
   - \( (6) \): LCM = 6.
   - \( (5, 1) \): LCM = 5.
   - \( (4, 2) \): LCM = 4.
   - \( (3, 3) \): LCM = 3.
   - \( (3, 2, 1) \): LCM = 6.
   - \( (2, 2, 2) \): LCM = 2.
   - \( (2, 1, 1, 1, 1) \): LCM = 2.

3. The maximum LCM occurs when the cycle decomposition is \( (5, 1)"
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1: Q is an extension field of Z_2.**
   - Z_2 is the finite field with 2 elements (0 and 1), and it is a field of characteristic 2.
   - Q, the field of rational numbers, is a field of characteristic 0.
   - An extension field must have the same characteristic as the base field. Since Q and Z_2 have different characteristics, Q cannot be an extension field of Z_2.
   - Therefore, Statement 1 is **False**.

2. **Statement 2: Every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field.**
   - This is a fundamental result in field theory. For any field F, and any non-constant polynomial p(x) over F, there exists an extension field of F in which p(x) has at least one root. This is guaranteed by the existence of splitting fields.
   - Therefore, Statement 2 is **True**.

Now, combining the results:
- Statement 1 is False.
- Statement 2 is True.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

**Statement 1**:  
1. If \( H \) is a subgroup of \( G \), then \( aH \) (the left coset of \( H \) by \( a \)) is generally not a subgroup of \( G \).  
2. For \( aH \) to be a subgroup of \( G \), it must satisfy the subgroup criteria (closure, identity, and inverses).  
3. This happens if and only if \( a \in H \), because in that case, \( aH = H \), which is already a subgroup of \( G \).  
Thus, **Statement 1 is true**.

**Statement 2**:  
1. If \( H \) is a subgroup of \( G \), then \( aH = bH \) (two left cosets are equal) if and only if \( a^{-1}b \in H \).  
2. This is equivalent to saying \( ab \in H \), which is **not correct**. The correct condition is \( a^{-1}b \in H \), not \( ab \in H \).  
Thus, **Statement 2 is false**.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I will proceed step by step:

1. The polynomial is \(x^2 + 1\) in \(Z_2\), which means the coefficients of the polynomial are in the finite field \(Z_2 = \{0, 1\}\). In this field, addition and multiplication are performed modulo 2.

2. To find the zeros of the polynomial, I need to test each element of \(Z_2\) (i.e., 0 and 1) to see if it satisfies the equation \(x^2 + 1 = 0\) in \(Z_2\).

   - For \(x = 0\): \(0^2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 \neq 0\). So, \(x = 0\) is not a zero.
   - For \(x = 1\): \(1^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \mod 2 = 0\). So, \(x = 1\) is a zero.

3. Therefore, the only zero of the polynomial \(x^2 + 1\) in \(Z_2\) is \(x = 1\).

"To solve this, we need to determine the order of the cyclic subgroup of \( \mathbb{Z}_{30} \) generated by 25. The order of the subgroup is the same as the order of the element 25 in \( \mathbb{Z}_{30} \), which is the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( 25n \equiv 0 \pmod{30} \).

1. First, calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 25 and 30. The gcd(25, 30) = 5.
2. The order of the element 25 in \( \mathbb{Z}_{30} \) is given by \( \frac{30}{\text{gcd}(25, 30)} = \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).
3. Therefore, the cyclic subgroup of \( \mathbb{Z}_{30} \) generated by 25 has 6 elements.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the order of the element (4, 2) in \( Z_{12} \times Z_8 \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Definition of order**: The order of an element \((a, b)\) in \( Z_{12} \times Z_8 \) is the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( n \cdot (a, b) = (0, 0) \), where the operations are performed modulo 12 and modulo 8, respectively.

2. **Calculate the order in each component**:
   - In \( Z_{12} \), the order of 4 is the smallest \( n \) such that \( n \cdot 4 \equiv 0 \mod 12 \). Solving \( 4n \equiv 0 \mod 12 \), we find \( n = 3 \) (since \( 4 \cdot 3 = 12 \)).
   - In \( Z_8 \), the order of 2 is the smallest \( n \) such that \( n \cdot 2 \equiv 0 \mod 8 \). Solving \( 2n \equiv 0 \mod 8 \), we find \( n = 4 \) (since \( 2 \cdot 4 = 8 \)).

3. **Determine the overall order**:
   - The order of \((4, 2)\) in \( Z_{12} \times Z_8 \) is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of 4 in \( Z_{12} \) and 2 in \( Z_8 \). The LCM of 3 and 4 is 12.

Thus, the order of \((4, 2)\) is 12.

"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement 1**: ""Every ideal in a ring is a subring of the ring.""
   - An ideal is a subset of a ring that is closed under addition and under multiplication by any element of the ring. These properties ensure that an ideal is also a subring of the ring. Hence, this statement is **true**.

2. **Statement 2**: ""Every subring of every ring is an ideal of the ring.""
   - A subring is a subset of a ring that is closed under addition, multiplication, and contains the additive identity. However, not every subring satisfies the additional property required to be an ideal, which is that it must be closed under multiplication by any element of the ring. For example, in the ring of integers, the subring of even integers is an ideal, but the subring of odd integers is not. Hence, this statement is **false**.
