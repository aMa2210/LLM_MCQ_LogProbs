answer
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. Jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels is generally governed by international maritime law, specifically the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
2. According to UNCLOS, the primary jurisdiction over a vessel is exercised by the flag State, which is the State under whose laws the vessel is registered and whose flag it flies.
3. While coastal States may have limited jurisdiction in certain circumstances (e.g., crimes affecting their territory or security), the general rule is that the flag State has jurisdiction over crimes committed on board its vessels.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the term ""justiciability."" It generally refers to the ability of a matter to be examined and decided upon by a court of law. 

Next, I need to evaluate the options:
a) This option suggests that justiciability is about the enforcement of a right by rights holders, but justiciability is more about whether a court can adjudicate the matter, not about enforcement by rights holders.
b) This option implies that justiciability is about the just nature or cause of a right, but justiciability is not about the moral or just nature of a right.
c) This option suggests that justiciability involves courts assessing whether non-enforcement conforms to justice principles, but justiciability is more about whether a matter is appropriate for judicial resolution.
d) This option implies that justiciability is about the State's obligation to enforce a right, but justiciability is not about the State's obligation but rather about the court's ability to adjudicate.

The correct understanding aligns with none of the options perfectly, but the closest interpretation is that justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a right by the relevant rights holders.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the concept of Responsibility to Protect (R2P):** R2P is a global political commitment endorsed by all United Nations member states in 2005. It focuses on preventing genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. It emphasizes the responsibility of states to protect their populations and, if they fail, the international community may intervene, often with the involvement of the UN Security Council (UNSC).

2. **Understand the concept of humanitarian intervention:** Humanitarian intervention refers to actions taken by states or international organizations to prevent or stop widespread suffering or human rights violations, often without the consent of the state where the intervention occurs. It is sometimes criticized for being arbitrary or lacking a clear legal framework.

3. **Compare the two concepts:** R2P is more structured and less arbitrary than humanitarian intervention because it requires some level of input or authorization from the UNSC. Additionally, R2P's primary goal is to prevent or stop humanitarian crises, whereas humanitarian intervention may not always have such a clear framework or objective.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the correct definition of the 'Lotus principle' in international law.  
The Lotus principle originates from the 1927 Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) decision in the Lotus case.  
The principle establishes that States have sovereignty and independence, and restrictions on their actions cannot be presumed unless explicitly prohibited by international law.  
This is often summarized as ""whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law.""  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the nature of the UK Constitution. It is known to be uncodified, meaning it is not written in a single document but rather spread across various sources such as statutes, common law, and conventions.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) is incorrect because the UK Constitution is not solely based on the sovereign's power; it is derived from multiple sources. Option b) is incorrect because the judiciary in the UK does not have the power to overturn acts of Parliament due to the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Option d) is incorrect because, while there is a Bill of Rights (1689), the UK Constitution is not solely based on it.

Finally, option c) is correct because the UK Constitution is indeed uncodified and found in a variety of sources.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the nature of the obligation for the peaceful settlement of disputes under international law. States are required to seek peaceful means to resolve disputes, but this does not necessarily mean they are obligated to achieve a specific result. 

Second, I need to consider whether this obligation is one of conduct or result. The obligation is one of conduct, meaning States must make efforts to resolve disputes peacefully, but they are not strictly required to resolve them.

Third, I need to evaluate the other options. The obligation is not a peremptory norm (jus cogens), nor is it solely the responsibility of international courts and tribunals. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze the changes introduced by Protocol 14 to the European Convention on Human Rights. Protocol 14 aimed to improve the efficiency of the European Court of Human Rights by introducing reforms.

1. Protocol 14 did change the committee that hears admissibility cases from a three-judge formation to a single-judge formation, so statement a) is true.
2. Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility, specifically the ""significant disadvantage"" criterion, so statement b) is true.
3. The Commission of Human Rights was abolished earlier by Protocol 11, not Protocol 14, so statement c) is false.
4. Protocol 14 did extend the judicial term of office for judges of the European Court of Human Rights from six to nine years, so statement d) is true.

Therefore, the false statement is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The question refers to the definition of ""rock"" under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), specifically Article 121(3).
2. Article 121(3) states that rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone (EEZ) or continental shelf.
3. Based on this, the correct definition of a ""rock"" under UNCLOS is an island that cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of its own and, therefore, does not have an EEZ or continental shelf.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of international legal personality. It refers to the capacity of an entity to have rights and duties under international law and to enforce these rights and duties.

Next, I analyze the options:
a) This is incorrect because international legal personality is not limited to States; other entities like international organizations and individuals can also have it.
b) This is correct because it accurately describes the essence of international legal personality: having rights and duties under international law and the capacity to enforce them.
c) This is incorrect because international legal personality does not inherently mean challenging the authority of States.
d) This is incorrect because it misrepresents the term by focusing on the distinction between legal and physical persons, which is not the primary meaning in this context.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify which of the options is specifically a treaty-based human rights mechanism. Treaty-based mechanisms are established under international human rights treaties and are responsible for monitoring the implementation of those treaties by state parties.

The UN Human Rights Committee (option a) is a treaty-based body established under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to monitor its implementation.

The UN Human Rights Council (option b) is a political body, not treaty-based, responsible for promoting and protecting human rights globally.

The UN Universal Periodic Review (option c) is a peer-review mechanism under the Human Rights Council, not treaty-based.

The UN special mandates (option d) refer to independent experts or working groups appointed by the Human Rights Council, not treaty-based.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to recall the key points of the UN Vienna Declaration of 1993. This declaration emphasized the universality, indivisibility, interdependence, and interrelatedness of all human rights.  
Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) is incorrect because the declaration does not prioritize third-generation rights. Option b) is incorrect because it does not single out civil and political rights as core rights. Option d) is incorrect because social and economic rights are enforceable under international law.  
Finally, option c) aligns with the declaration's emphasis on the indivisibility, interrelatedness, and interdependence of all human rights.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the principal source of immunity for international organizations (IOs). Immunities for IOs are typically established to ensure their independent functioning and are often codified in legal agreements.

Next, I consider the options. The UN Charter (option a) does not specifically provide immunity for all IOs, as it primarily governs the United Nations. Customary law (option c) may play a role but is not the principal source. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Immunities (option d) applies to diplomatic relations, not IOs.

Finally, headquarters agreements and multilateral treaties (option b) are the primary legal instruments that define and provide specific immunities for IOs, tailored to their needs and operations.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the principle of sovereign equality under international law, which is a fundamental concept enshrined in Article 2, paragraph 1 of the UN Charter. This principle states that all States are equal in terms of their sovereignty.

Next, while the Permanent Five Members of the UN Security Council (P5) have special privileges, such as veto power, this does not imply a general hierarchy among States under international law. Their privileges are specific to the functioning of the UN Security Council.

Finally, the idea of hierarchy among States is not determined by individual international organizations but rather by the overarching principles of international law, which emphasize equality among sovereign States.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"The declaratory theory of recognition posits that recognition is not determinative of statehood but rather acknowledges the pre-existing fact of statehood. 

Step 1: Understand the declaratory theory of recognition, which holds that a state exists as a legal entity once it meets the criteria of statehood (as per international law), regardless of whether other states recognize it.

Step 2: Analyze the options. Option a suggests recognition is determinate for statehood, which contradicts the declaratory theory. Option b aligns with the theory, as it states recognition is declaratory but not determinate. Option c misrepresents the theory as merely a declaration of interest. Option d incorrectly implies recognition requires a declaration by the new state.

Step 3: Conclude that the correct answer is the one that aligns with the declaratory theory's principle that recognition acknowledges statehood but does not determine it.

{'sol': 'b'}"
"First, I need to understand the concept of ""standard-setting"" in the context of human rights diplomacy. It generally refers to the process of establishing norms or guidelines related to human rights.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a suggests binding legal standards, but standard-setting often involves non-binding norms. Option b also mentions binding standards but focuses on proposing them, which is not entirely accurate. Option c refers to non-binding legal standards, which aligns more closely with the idea of standard-setting in human rights diplomacy. Option d mentions standards of conduct in treaties, but treaties are typically binding, which does not fully align with the concept of standard-setting.

Finally, based on the analysis, the most accurate description of standard-setting in human rights diplomacy is putting forward non-binding legal standards.

{'sol': 'c'}"
"First, I need to understand the context of the Kadi judgment. The Kadi judgment by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) addressed the relationship between UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and EU law, particularly focusing on the protection of fundamental rights.

Next, the judgment emphasized that while UNSC resolutions are binding under international law, their implementation within the EU must respect fundamental rights as guaranteed by EU law. This introduced a dimension of human rights scrutiny to the incorporation of UNSC resolutions.

Finally, the correct choice aligns with the idea that UNSC resolutions must be construed in accordance with human rights, as the Kadi judgment did not reject the binding nature of UNSC resolutions outright but required their compatibility with fundamental rights.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to identify what the Magna Carta is. The Magna Carta was a historical document created in 1215. It was an agreement between King John of England and his barons.

Next, I need to determine its purpose. The Magna Carta guaranteed certain protections for the subjects, such as limiting the king's power and ensuring certain legal rights.

Finally, I compare the options. Option b matches the description of the Magna Carta as an agreement in 1215 between the King and his barons, guaranteeing certain protections for subjects.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To answer this question, I will analyze the concept of international legal personality and its application to individuals, States, and international organizations.

1. States and international organizations are primary subjects of international law and enjoy full international legal personality, meaning they have rights and obligations under international law and can participate in international legal processes.

2. Individuals, however, have a more limited form of international legal personality. They can be subjects of international law in specific contexts, such as being held accountable for crimes under international criminal law (e.g., through the International Criminal Court) or having rights under international human rights law. However, their legal personality is not as broad or comprehensive as that of States or international organizations.

3. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that individuals enjoy international legal personality, but it is limited in scope compared to States and international organizations.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze the nature of the methods of peaceful settlement of disputes. Political methods like negotiation, mediation, inquiry, and conciliation are generally non-binding and rely on the consent and cooperation of the disputing parties. Legal methods, such as arbitration and adjudication, are binding and involve a legal decision.

Next, I need to consider whether there is a hierarchy or priority among these methods. International law does not impose a strict hierarchy; instead, it allows states to choose the method they prefer, based on their mutual agreement and the nature of the dispute.

Finally, I need to evaluate the options. Option a suggests that political methods must be exhausted first, but this is not a requirement under international law. Option b incorrectly states that legal methods prevail over political methods. Option d suggests that an impartial third party decides the priority, which is not accurate. Option c correctly reflects the principle that there is no hierarchy, and the choice belongs to the disputing states.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze each statement to determine its accuracy based on historical context.

1. Statement a) claims the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) needed reform in the 1990s because it wasn't examining enough cases. This is false because the issue was not about the number of cases examined but rather the growing backlog due to an increase in complaints.

2. Statement b) mentions the workload increase as a reason for reform. This is true, as the ECHR faced a significant rise in cases during the 1990s.

3. Statement c) states the ECHR was a part-time court unable to handle the growing number of complaints. This is true, as the court operated on a part-time basis before reforms in the late 1990s.

4. Statement d) refers to the growth in the number of individuals accessing the court due to an increase in member states. This is true, as the expansion of the Council of Europe led to more individuals being able to bring cases to the ECHR.

Therefore, the false statement is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of proportionality in international law. Proportionality means that the response of the victim State must be limited to what is necessary to address the aggression and restore peace, without exceeding the bounds of necessity.

Next, I analyze the options. Option a suggests using the same means and intensity as the aggressor, which is not necessarily proportional. Option b allows for any means, which could exceed what is necessary and violate proportionality. Option d implies inaction without Security Council approval, which is unrelated to proportionality. Option c aligns with the principle of proportionality, as it emphasizes using only the necessary means and force.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. Jurisdiction refers to the authority of a state or legal body to govern or enforce laws within a specific area or over certain individuals.
2. Ordinarily, jurisdiction is based on territorial principles, meaning it applies within the geographical boundaries of a state or country.
3. While there are exceptions (e.g., extra-territorial jurisdiction in certain cases), the general rule is that jurisdiction is territorial.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the formal sources of international law, I will analyze the options step by step:

1. The recognized formal sources of international law are generally outlined in Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). These include treaties, international custom, and general principles of law recognized by civilized nations.

2. Judicial decisions and scholarly writings are considered subsidiary means for determining rules of law, not formal sources.

3. General Assembly Resolutions are not binding unless they reflect customary international law or are incorporated into treaties.

4. Based on this understanding, the correct answer must include treaties, custom, and general principles of law.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the purpose of baselines under the law of the sea. Baselines are the lines from which the breadth of maritime zones is measured, such as territorial seas, exclusive economic zones, and continental shelves.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) mentions internal waters, but baselines are not limited to internal waters; they are used for all maritime zones. Option b) correctly states that baselines are instrumental for establishing all maritime zones, as they are the starting point for measuring the breadth of each zone. Option c) refers to safe navigation, which is not the primary purpose of baselines. Option d) is incorrect because baselines are not only drawn in cases of maritime delimitation.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze the definitions of conciliation and mediation. Mediation typically involves a neutral third party who facilitates communication and negotiation between disputing parties to help them reach a voluntary agreement. Conciliation, on the other hand, often involves a commission or panel that examines the dispute impartially and proposes terms for settlement.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a is incorrect because conciliation does not necessarily produce a binding result. Option b is incorrect because conciliation is not exclusively conducted by UN representatives. Option d is incorrect because conciliation is not limited to treaty-based methods.

Finally, option c correctly describes the distinction: mediation is conducted by a person appointed with the consent of the parties, while conciliation involves a commission that examines the dispute impartially and proposes settlement terms.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall the Osman test established by the European Court of Human Rights in Osman v UK (1998). The test outlines the circumstances under which a state has a positive obligation to protect individuals from harm.

Next, I need to analyze each option:
- Option a) ""The risk must emanate from a state agent"" is not part of the Osman test, as the test applies to risks from any source, not just state agents.
- Option b) ""If a real and imminent risk (of death/harm)"" is part of the Osman test, as it requires the risk to be real and immediate.
- Option c) ""A state should take reasonable steps to prevent death/harm occurring"" is part of the Osman test, as it emphasizes the state's duty to take reasonable measures.
- Option d) ""A state knows or ought to have known"" is part of the Osman test, as it addresses the state's awareness of the risk.

Finally, the statement that is not part of the Osman test is option a). Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to identify the entities that are entitled to request an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ). According to the ICJ Statute, the General Assembly and the Security Council have the authority to request advisory opinions on any legal question.

Next, I need to consider whether other entities can also request advisory opinions. The ICJ Statute specifies that other organs of the United Nations and specialized agencies, which have been authorized by the General Assembly, may also request advisory opinions on legal questions arising within the scope of their activities.

Finally, I need to compare the options provided and select the one that accurately reflects this information. The correct answer is the one that includes the General Assembly, the Security Council, and other UN organs and specialized agencies authorized by the General Assembly.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of universal jurisdiction. Universal jurisdiction allows states to claim criminal jurisdiction over an accused person regardless of where the alleged crime was committed, the nationality of the suspect, or the nationality of the victims.

Next, I need to identify the purpose of universal jurisdiction. Its primary aim is to ensure that certain serious international crimes, such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, do not go unpunished, even if they occur outside the jurisdiction of any specific state.

Finally, I need to match this understanding with the options provided. The correct answer is the one that emphasizes providing jurisdiction to all states for specific crimes, not all international crimes.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider the principles of international law regarding the attribution of acts to a State. According to the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), the conduct of any State organ is attributable to the State, even if the conduct exceeds the authority granted to the organ (ultra vires), as long as the organ acts in its official capacity.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) aligns with the principle that the conduct of any State organ, whether authorized or ultra vires, is attributable to the State. Option b) is incorrect because it limits attribution to higher echelons of government, which is not consistent with international law. Option c) is incorrect because it restricts attribution to intra vires acts, which is not the case under ARSIWA. Option d) is incorrect because it limits attribution to the executive branch, excluding other State organs.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to recall the definition of a 'treaty' as per the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT). According to Article 2(1)(a) of the VCLT, a treaty is defined as ""an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law.""

Next, I need to evaluate the options:
- Option a includes agreements with international organizations and non-State entities, which is not correct as per the VCLT definition.
- Option b matches the VCLT definition, as it specifies agreements between States, in written form, and governed by international law.
- Option c includes oral agreements, which are not considered treaties under the VCLT.
- Option d includes agreements governed by domestic law, which is not accurate under the VCLT definition.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine whether the unlawful homicide committed by a Minister of country X abroad is an act jure imperii or jure gestionis, we need to analyze the nature of the act and its connection to the official capacity of the Minister.

1. Acts jure imperii are sovereign or public acts performed by a state or its officials in their official capacity. These acts are typically protected by state immunity under international law.
2. Acts jure gestionis, on the other hand, are private or commercial acts that are not connected to the sovereign functions of the state and do not attract immunity.
3. Unlawful homicide, even if committed by a Minister, is generally not considered a sovereign act unless it is directly linked to the exercise of state authority or official duties. However, international law has increasingly limited immunity for serious crimes such as unlawful killings, especially when they violate jus cogens norms.

Considering these points, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall the key facts of the Al-Adsani case. This case involved a claim of torture against Kuwait, and the applicant argued that the grant of state immunity by UK courts violated his right to access a court under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Next, I need to consider the European Court of Human Rights' reasoning. The Court acknowledged the importance of the right to a fair trial but also recognized that state immunity is a principle of international law aimed at ensuring good relations between states.

Finally, the Court concluded that granting immunity to Kuwait did not violate Article 6 because it was a proportionate measure in pursuit of a legitimate aim under international law.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall the role of the Badinter Commission, which was established to provide legal opinions on the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the recognition of its successor states.  
Next, I need to identify the criteria imposed by the Commission. One of the key requirements was that the new states commit to respecting human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.  
Finally, I can eliminate the other options: the Commission did not require changes in boundaries, exchanges of ethnic populations, or mandatory submission of disputes to the ICJ.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider the general principles of treaty interpretation as established in international law. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969) provides guidance on this matter.  
Next, Article 31 of the Vienna Convention states that treaties are to be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms in their context and in light of the treaty's object and purpose.  
Finally, based on this principle, the correct answer aligns with the description provided in option a).  

{'sol': 'a'}"
"First, I need to consider the general principles of international law regarding the jurisdiction of coastal States over foreign vessels in their ports. Coastal States have the right to enforce their laws within their territory, including their ports.

Next, I need to evaluate the specific circumstances under which coastal States enforce their criminal jurisdiction. Generally, they do not enforce jurisdiction over crimes that do not affect their customs laws, peace, or public order, unless there are exceptional circumstances.

Finally, I need to match the correct choice with the principle that coastal States enforce their jurisdiction primarily when their customs laws, peace, or public order are infringed. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the role of UN General Assembly (GA) Resolutions in international law. GA Resolutions are not binding upon States unless they are incorporated into binding treaties or reflect customary international law.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) is incorrect because GA Resolutions are not binding unless they reflect customary law or are part of a treaty. Option b) is incorrect because GA Resolutions are not equivalent to treaties, which are binding agreements between States. Option c) is incorrect because GA Resolutions do not always reflect customary law; they may sometimes contribute to its development. Option d) is correct because GA Resolutions are considered as material sources that may enunciate statements of customary law or contribute to its formation.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To answer this question, I will analyze the principles of international law regarding treaties and third States:

1. According to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969), treaties generally bind only the parties to them. Third States, which are not parties to a treaty, are not bound by its provisions unless they expressly consent to be bound.
2. Article 34 of the Vienna Convention states that a treaty does not create obligations or rights for a third State without its consent. This means that third States must agree to any obligations or rights conferred upon them by a treaty.
3. Therefore, treaties do not automatically create obligations or rights for third States unless the third State consents to such provisions.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which articles are not qualified rights, I need to first understand the nature of qualified rights. Qualified rights are those that can be restricted under certain conditions, such as for the protection of public safety, health, or morals, or for the rights and freedoms of others. Examples of qualified rights include the right to respect for private and family life (Article 8), freedom of thought, conscience, and religion (Article 9), and freedom of assembly and association (Article 11). Absolute rights, on the other hand, cannot be restricted under any circumstances, such as the prohibition of torture (Article 3).

Step 1: Article 3 (prohibition of torture) is an absolute right and cannot be restricted under any conditions. Therefore, it is not a qualified right.
Step 2: Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life) is a qualified right, as it can be restricted under certain conditions.
Step 3: Article 9 (freedom of thought, conscience, and religion) and Article 11 (freedom of assembly and association) are also qualified rights, as they can be restricted under specific circumstances.

Thus, the article that is not a qualified right is Article 3.

{'sol': 'a'}"
"First, I need to understand the concept of dualism in the context of law. Dualism refers to the idea that international law and domestic law operate as separate and distinct legal systems. 

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a suggests a unified legal system, which aligns more with monism, not dualism. Option b correctly states that international and domestic laws are distinct legal systems, which is the essence of dualism. Option c introduces the idea of equality in hierarchy, which is not a defining feature of dualism. Option d incorrectly states that domestic law always prevails, which is not a general principle of dualism.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The term ""jure imperii"" refers to acts performed by a State in its sovereign capacity, as opposed to ""jure gestionis,"" which refers to acts performed in a commercial or private capacity.
2. Option a) is incorrect because ""jure imperii"" specifically pertains to acts of a State, not international organizations.
3. Option b) is correct because acts undertaken in an official State capacity are considered acts jure imperii, reflecting the sovereign authority of the State.
4. Option c) is incorrect because not all acts by State officials are jure imperii; some may be jure gestionis if they are commercial or private in nature.
5. Option d) is incorrect because acts by State corporations are not automatically jure imperii; they may also be jure gestionis depending on the nature of the act.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the formal sources of international law, which include treaties, customary international law, and general principles of law. These sources are recognized as primary sources under Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.

Next, I need to determine if there is a hierarchy among these sources. In international law, there is generally no strict hierarchy between treaties, custom, and general principles. However, specific rules may apply in certain cases, such as jus cogens norms (peremptory norms) that override conflicting treaties or customs.

Finally, I conclude that the correct answer is that there is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law, as they are applied based on context and relevance to the case.

{'sol': 'a'}"
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a**: Resolution 678 allowed the allies to attack Iraq with nuclear and chemical weapons.  
   - This is incorrect because Resolution 678 did not specifically authorize the use of nuclear or chemical weapons. It authorized ""all necessary means"" to restore peace and security, but this does not imply the use of such weapons.

2. **Option b**: Resolution 678 is narrower than the inherent right of self-defence under Article 51 UN Charter.  
   - This is incorrect because Resolution 678 is not narrower; it is broader in scope as it authorized collective action by member states, not just individual or collective self-defense.

3. **Option c**: Resolution 678 was faster to adopt and negotiate.  
   - This is unlikely because the adoption of a Security Council resolution involves significant negotiation and agreement among member states, which can take time. There is no evidence that Resolution 678 was particularly faster.

4. **Option d**: Resolution 678 is broader because it authorized the use of force with respect to any matter threatening the peace and security of the Gulf region.  
   - This is correct. Resolution 678 provided a broader mandate by authorizing the use of force to address threats to peace and security in the Gulf region, beyond the narrower scope of self-defense under Article 51.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To answer this question, I will analyze the relationship between customary law and treaty provisions step by step:

1. Customary law is a source of international law that arises from consistent state practice and a sense of legal obligation (opinio juris). Treaties, on the other hand, are written agreements between states that are legally binding.

2. Treaties can interact with customary law in several ways. They may codify existing customary law by putting it into written form, thereby formalizing and clarifying it.

3. Treaties can also ""crystallize"" customary law, meaning that they can help solidify emerging customary practices into recognized legal norms.

4. Additionally, treaties can lead to the emergence of new customary law when their provisions are widely accepted and followed by states, even by those not party to the treaty.

5. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is the option that reflects all three ways treaties can relate to customary law: codification, crystallization, and emergence.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the concept of sovereignty step by step:

1. Sovereignty refers to the authority of a State to govern itself without external interference. It is a fundamental principle in international law that allows a State to make decisions regarding its internal and external affairs independently.

2. While recognition by other States, the ability to enter treaties, and the right to self-defense are important aspects of a State's functioning, they are not the core definition of sovereignty. Sovereignty primarily emphasizes the freedom to determine one's own affairs.

3. Based on the options provided, the most accurate definition of sovereignty aligns with the idea of freedom from external interference in determining one's own affairs.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the meaning of functional recognition, I will analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) suggests that recognition is a function rather than a power. This does not align with the concept of functional recognition, which typically refers to recognizing specific acts or functions rather than the entity as a whole.

2. Option b) implies that recognition is reciprocal between two States. While recognition can involve reciprocity, this does not specifically define functional recognition.

3. Option c) states that recognition is only afforded to particular administrative acts, not to the entity's declared statehood. This aligns with the idea of functional recognition, where specific functions or acts are recognized without necessarily recognizing the entity's statehood.

4. Option d) claims that recognition is only afforded to the government, not the State. This does not align with the concept of functional recognition, as it focuses on recognizing specific functions or acts rather than the government or State as a whole.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the ""act of State"" doctrine. It is a principle in international law that generally prevents domestic courts from questioning the validity of public acts committed by a recognized foreign sovereign within its own territory.

Next, I analyze the options:
a) This suggests that all State acts attract immunity, which is not entirely accurate as the doctrine applies specifically to foreign sovereign acts within their territory.
b) This suggests that the assessment of an alleged tort by a State belongs to the executive, which is not the essence of the doctrine.
c) This suggests that courts are well-placed to assess alleged torts by the State, which contradicts the doctrine's principle of judicial non-interference.
d) This correctly identifies the doctrine as a legal mechanism that provides immunity to public acts of foreign States.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the structure of the international society, I need to analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a suggests that the international society follows a vertical model similar to domestic legal orders. However, international society lacks a central authority or hierarchy like domestic systems, so this is unlikely to be correct.

2. Option b describes the international society as a constellation of sovereign states and international organizations in a horizontal order of authority. This aligns with the decentralized and equal nature of states in international law, where no single entity has overarching authority.

3. Option c claims that the international society is entirely anarchical with no order of authority. While international society is often described as anarchical, there is still a horizontal order of authority among states and organizations, so this is not entirely accurate.

4. Option d suggests that the structure of the international society resembles the structure of the most powerful nations. While powerful nations have significant influence, the international society is not formally structured around them.

The most accurate description is option b. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To answer this question, I will analyze the options step by step:

1. Customary international law, including customary crimes, is not automatically incorporated into English law. Historically, English law has required either judicial recognition or legislative action for such incorporation.
2. Option (a) is incorrect because there are limitations to the incorporation of customary crimes under English law.
3. Option (b) is also incorrect because customary crimes do not need to be contained in a multilateral treaty to be incorporated; treaties require separate ratification and implementation.
4. Option (c) is incorrect because courts in England do not have the authority to freely incorporate customary crimes into domestic law without legislative backing.
5. Option (d) is the most accurate because the incorporation of customary crimes into English law would most likely require an act of Parliament, as the situation is not straightforward and depends on legislative action.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the function of the contiguous zone, I will analyze the options step by step:

1. The contiguous zone is defined under international law, specifically the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). It extends beyond the territorial sea, up to 24 nautical miles from the baseline of a coastal state.
2. Within this zone, the coastal state has limited jurisdiction to prevent and punish infringements of its customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws and regulations that occur within its territory or territorial sea.
3. Based on this, the correct function of the contiguous zone aligns with the description in option c.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the options and determine which one does not align with the European Court of Human Rights' established positive obligations.  
Second, the European Court of Human Rights has recognized positive obligations in situations such as protecting individuals in state custody (a), investigating claims against the state (b), and creating a legal framework to protect individuals (c).  
Third, while the state has obligations to address homelessness, the Court has not explicitly developed a positive obligation to provide housing for all homeless individuals (d).  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze the choices step by step:

1. The doctrine of 'margin of appreciation' is a principle used by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to allow national authorities some discretion in how they implement the rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights, considering their cultural, historical, and societal differences.

2. The case that first defined this doctrine is significant because it established the framework for how the ECHR would balance the sovereignty of member states with the enforcement of human rights.

3. Among the choices, **Handyside v UK (1976)** is widely recognized as the first case where the ECHR explicitly articulated and applied the doctrine of 'margin of appreciation,' particularly in the context of freedom of expression and the protection of morals.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Arbitration typically involves the parties in dispute having a say in the appointment of arbitrators. This ensures fairness and mutual agreement in the process.
2. In most arbitration systems, each party appoints one arbitrator, and the two appointed arbitrators then agree on a third arbitrator (often the presiding arbitrator or chairperson). This process reflects the principle of party autonomy.
3. While there are cases where an impartial third party (like an institution or court) may intervene to appoint arbitrators, this usually happens only if the parties cannot agree on the appointments themselves.

Considering these points, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To answer this question, I will analyze the relationship between peremptory norms (jus cogens) and obligations erga omnes in international law.

1. Peremptory norms of international law (jus cogens) are universally binding norms from which no derogation is permitted. They inherently create obligations erga omnes, meaning obligations owed to the international community as a whole.

2. However, obligations erga omnes are not exclusively derived from peremptory norms. They can also arise from other sources, such as treaties regulating objective regimes (e.g., treaties protecting shared resources or common heritage) or unilateral acts that establish obligations toward the international community.

3. Therefore, while all peremptory norms create obligations erga omnes, not all obligations erga omnes necessarily stem from peremptory norms.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"The constitutive theory of recognition posits that recognition by other states is what determines the legal existence of a state in the international system. 

Step 1: The theory emphasizes that a state does not fully exist in the international legal sense until it is recognized by other states. 
Step 2: This means that recognition is determinative of statehood, as opposed to the declarative theory, which holds that statehood is based on objective criteria like a defined territory, population, government, and capacity to enter into relations with other states.
Step 3: Among the given choices, the one that aligns with the constitutive theory is the idea that recognition is determinative of statehood.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to identify the enforcement mechanisms of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The ICCPR has a reporting mechanism where states submit periodic reports to the Human Rights Committee on how they are implementing the rights.

Next, I need to consider the Optional Protocol to the ICCPR, which allows for the right to individual petition. This means individuals can bring complaints about violations of their rights under the ICCPR to the Human Rights Committee.

Finally, combining these mechanisms, the ICCPR includes both a reporting mechanism and the right to individual petition (if the state has ratified the Optional Protocol).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of piracy jure gentium. It refers to piracy under international law, which is considered a crime against all nations.

Next, I need to determine the jurisdiction applicable to piracy jure gentium. Under international law, piracy is recognized as a universal crime, meaning any state can prosecute it regardless of the nationality of the pirates or the victims, or the location of the crime.

Finally, I confirm that universal jurisdiction applies to piracy jure gentium, as it is a crime that threatens the international community as a whole.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Self-executing treaties are those that become effective as domestic law without the need for additional legislation or implementing measures. They are clear and precise enough to be directly applied by courts.
2. Option a is incorrect because self-executing treaties are not solely adopted by the executive; they are international agreements that may require ratification but do not need further legislative action to be enforceable.
3. Option b is correct because it aligns with the definition of self-executing treaties: they are clear and precise enough to be directly applied without further implementing measures.
4. Option c is incorrect because self-executing treaties do not rely on implementing measures; that would describe non-self-executing treaties.
5. Option d is incorrect because the doctrine of transformation refers to the process of converting international law into domestic law, which is not necessary for self-executing treaties.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) addressed the concept of an ""armed attack"" in the *Nicaragua v. United States* case. In this case, the ICJ considered whether a series of smaller-scale uses of force could cumulatively amount to an armed attack.
2. The ICJ did not dismiss the possibility of the accumulation theory outright. Instead, it acknowledged that a series of lower-intensity uses of force could potentially be considered an armed attack if they collectively meet the threshold of gravity required under international law.
3. Therefore, the ICJ was not hostile to the accumulation theory, as it left room for the idea that multiple smaller instances of armed force could cumulatively constitute an armed attack.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze the concept of priority among international courts and tribunals. International law operates on the principle of consent, meaning that states must agree to the jurisdiction of a court or tribunal. This suggests that there is no inherent hierarchy or priority unless explicitly agreed upon.

Second, the lis pendens rule, which gives priority to the court that first seizes a dispute, is not a recognized principle in international law. This eliminates the possibility of exclusive jurisdiction based on timing.

Third, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) does not have automatic priority over other courts or tribunals. Its jurisdiction depends on the consent of the parties involved, and it operates alongside other international and regional courts.

Finally, the principle of lex specialis (special law) applies in specific contexts, but it does not establish a general priority for regional or special courts over others.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider the legal framework governing the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). According to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the coastal State has sovereign rights over the natural resources within its EEZ, including fisheries.

Next, I need to determine if there are any exceptions to this rule. UNCLOS specifies that if the coastal State cannot harvest the 'total allowable catch' of the living resources in its EEZ, it must give other States access to the surplus. Priority is to be given to developing and land-locked States.

Finally, I need to evaluate the options provided. Option a) aligns with the provisions of UNCLOS, as it mentions the surplus and prioritization of developing and land-locked States. The other options contradict the legal framework or are overly restrictive.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of sovereign immunity. Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that protects a sovereign state or its officials from being sued in the courts of another state without its consent.

Next, I need to evaluate the choices:
a) This is incorrect because sovereign immunity is not specifically about protecting foreign Heads of State from embarrassment.
b) This is incorrect because sovereign immunity does not relate to physical invasion by another state.
c) This is correct because sovereign immunity primarily shields states from being sued in the courts of other states without their consent.
d) This is incorrect because sovereign immunity does not offer impunity for all crimes; it is limited to legal jurisdiction.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the concept of passive personality jurisdiction step by step:

1. Passive personality jurisdiction refers to a principle in international law that allows a state to claim jurisdiction to prosecute a foreign national for offenses committed abroad that harm its nationals.
2. This principle is based on the nationality of the victim, not the offender or the location of the crime.
3. Therefore, passive personality jurisdiction is jurisdiction based on the nationality of the victims.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the classification of rights. First-generation rights are typically associated with civil and political rights, which focus on individual freedoms and protection from state interference.  
Next, I need to differentiate these from other types of rights. Social and economic rights are second-generation rights, cultural rights are often considered third-generation rights, and people's rights (like collective rights) are also third-generation.  
Finally, based on this understanding, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of fragmentation in international law. Fragmentation refers to the division or lack of coherence in international law due to the existence of multiple legal regimes or systems.

Next, I analyze the options. Option a suggests that fragmentation concerns the application of the same rules by different regimes, which is not the core issue. Option b highlights the development of isolated legal regimes leading to divergent rules, which aligns with the concept of fragmentation. Option c refers to different interpretations of the same rule, which is related but not the primary issue of fragmentation. Option d refers to States disagreeing to abide by a rule, which is more about non-compliance than fragmentation.

Finally, I conclude that the correct answer is the one that best describes the issue of isolated legal regimes producing divergent rules, which is option b.

{'sol': 'b'}"
"Functional (ratione materiae) immunity refers to the immunity granted to acts performed by individuals in their official capacity on behalf of the State. This type of immunity protects the act itself, as it is considered an act of the State, and incidentally also shields the person who performed the act, as they were acting in their official capacity.

Step 1: Understand the concept of functional immunity. It applies to acts performed in an official capacity, not to the individual personally, and is tied to the nature of the act rather than the status of the person.

Step 2: Analyze the options. Option a suggests the immunity covers the person but not the act, which is incorrect because functional immunity is tied to the act. Option c suggests it covers the State and incidentally the act, which is not accurate because the focus is on the act performed in an official capacity. Option d suggests it covers both private and public acts, which is incorrect because functional immunity does not apply to private acts.

Step 3: Conclude that the correct answer is option b, as functional immunity covers the act performed in an official capacity and incidentally also the person committing the act.

{'sol': 'b'}"
"First, I need to understand the concept of implied authorisation. It refers to situations where the use of armed force is considered authorised by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) without explicit approval, based on certain conditions or interpretations.

Next, I will evaluate the options:
a) This suggests a presumption of approval when a State has been forewarned, but it does not align with the concept of implied authorisation.
b) This refers to implicit authorisation based on a specific number of votes, which aligns with the idea of implied authorisation in the context of UNSC decisions.
c) This suggests a general presumption of armed force for all unlawful attacks, which is not accurate for implied authorisation.
d) This implies a specific scenario of repeated attacks and neighbouring States taking measures, which is not directly related to implied authorisation.

The most accurate choice is b). {'sol': 'b'}"
"First, I need to identify which philosopher is associated with the critique of natural rights as ""nonsense on stilts.""  
Next, I recall that Jeremy Bentham, a utilitarian philosopher, is known for his criticism of natural rights, which he considered to be baseless and impractical.  
Finally, I confirm that none of the other philosophers listed (Alan Gerwith, Emmanuel Kant, or John Locke) are known for this specific critique.  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) states that treaties are concluded by competent representatives of States, and it presumes that heads of States, heads of governments, ministers of foreign affairs, and heads of diplomatic missions have such authority. This aligns with international law principles, particularly the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which recognizes these individuals as having the authority to act on behalf of their States without needing to present full powers.

2. Option b) limits the authority to negotiate and conclude treaties only to heads of State and ministers of foreign affairs. This is incorrect because heads of governments and heads of diplomatic missions are also presumed to have such authority under international law.

3. Option c) claims that treaties are signed only by persons with 'full powers' and that no one is presumed to hold such authority. This is incorrect because certain individuals, such as heads of State, heads of government, and ministers of foreign affairs, are presumed to have the authority to conclude treaties without needing to present full powers.

4. Option d) restricts the authority to conclude treaties only to members of diplomatic missions. This is incorrect because the authority to conclude treaties is not limited to diplomatic missions; it also includes heads of State, heads of government, and ministers of foreign affairs.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the concept of a 'persistent objector' step by step:

1. A 'persistent objector' is a principle in international law that allows a state to avoid being bound by a rule of customary international law if it has consistently and publicly objected to the rule from its inception.
2. This means the state must object to the formation of the rule from the outset and continue to object persistently throughout its development.
3. Based on the choices provided, the correct definition aligns with the state that persistently and publicly objects to the formation of a rule of customary law from its outset.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of collective security. Collective security refers to a system in which a group of nations agree to act together to maintain peace and security, often by deterring or responding to aggression against any member of the group.

Next, I analyze the options:
a) This option aligns with the idea of nations acting together for mutual defense, which is a key aspect of collective security.
b) This option focuses on allies defending a victim state, but collective security is broader and involves a collective agreement among multiple nations, not just allies.
c) This option refers to the UN Security Council authorizing armed force, which is a mechanism of collective security but not its definition.
d) This option refers to peacekeeping missions authorized by the UN General Assembly, which is not directly related to the concept of collective security.

Finally, I determine that the best answer is a) because it captures the essence of collective security as a system of mutual defense by multiple nations acting together.

{'sol': 'a'}"
"First, I need to identify the primary focus of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The ECHR is a treaty aimed at protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe.

Next, I consider the types of rights it emphasizes. The ECHR is primarily concerned with civil and political rights, such as the right to life, prohibition of torture, freedom of expression, and the right to a fair trial.

Finally, I compare this focus with the given options. The correct answer aligns with civil and political rights.

{'sol': 'c'}"
"To answer this question, I will analyze the principles governing the jurisdiction of international tribunals and compare them to those of national courts.

1. National courts typically derive their jurisdiction from domestic laws and constitutions, which define their authority over specific cases and individuals. These principles include territorial jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction, and subject-matter jurisdiction.

2. International tribunals, on the other hand, derive their jurisdiction from international treaties, agreements, or resolutions that establish them. While some principles, such as subject-matter jurisdiction, may overlap with those of national courts, international tribunals operate under a distinct framework tailored to their specific mandates.

3. Therefore, international tribunals share some jurisdictional principles with national courts, but their jurisdiction is not entirely governed by the same principles. Their authority is often dictated by their founding treaties or agreements, and in some cases, by the UN Security Council (e.g., ad hoc tribunals like the ICTY and ICTR).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the concept of collective rights. Collective rights refer to rights that are held by a group rather than by individual members of the group. 

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) states that collective rights belong to distinct groups of people, which is partially correct but does not fully capture the essence of collective rights. Option b) specifies that collective rights belong to particular groups as opposed to individual members, which aligns with the definition. Option c) equates minority rights with collective rights, which is not entirely accurate as minority rights are a subset of collective rights. Option d) suggests that collective rights include both group rights and individual rights, which is not the primary focus of collective rights.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the question step by step:

1. The question asks about the obligations of States when they conduct negotiations. This implies a focus on international law and diplomatic principles.
2. In international law, States are generally expected to conduct negotiations in good faith and ensure that the process is meaningful. This means they should engage sincerely and with the intention of resolving disputes or reaching agreements.
3. While States are not obligated to guarantee a solution (eliminating option c), they are expected to ensure that negotiations are not superficial or insincere. Additionally, there is no general obligation to inform the UN Secretary-General about the progress of negotiations (eliminating option d). Option a is incorrect because it suggests no obligations at all, which contradicts principles of good faith in international relations.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the key concepts of naturalism and positivism. Naturalism is a philosophical approach that emphasizes the existence of universal moral principles or values that underpin laws and society. Positivism, on the other hand, focuses on the structured and codified legal systems created by states, emphasizing the importance of written laws and rules over moral or natural principles.

Next, I need to analyze the options. Option a highlights the distinction between universal moral principles (naturalism) and state-created legal systems (positivism), which aligns with the definitions. Option b incorrectly limits naturalism to human rights law, which is not accurate. Option c correctly identifies that naturalism concerns values and positivism concerns rules, which is a valid distinction. Option d incorrectly associates naturalism and positivism with geographical regions, which is not a defining characteristic.

Finally, I compare the valid options (a and c). While both are correct, option c provides a more precise and concise distinction between the two concepts.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) suggests that an internationally wrongful conduct is limited to breaches of international criminal law. However, internationally wrongful conduct is broader and includes breaches of any international obligation, not just criminal law. This option is incorrect.

2. Option b) states that every breach of an international obligation of the State is an internationally wrongful conduct, regardless of whether it is attributable to the State. However, attribution to the State is a key element in defining internationally wrongful conduct. This option is incorrect.

3. Option c) defines internationally wrongful conduct as an action or omission attributable to the State that breaches an international obligation of the State. This aligns with the general principles of international law, where both attribution and breach of an obligation are necessary elements. This option is correct.

4. Option d) focuses on the inability to excuse conduct on grounds like necessity or force majeure. While these are defenses to internationally wrongful conduct, they do not define what constitutes such conduct. This option is incorrect.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The effects doctrine is a principle in international law that allows a state to assert jurisdiction over conduct that occurs outside its territory but has effects within its territory.
2. Option a) is incorrect because the effects doctrine is not about jurisdiction being effective but about the effects of conduct within a state's territory.
3. Option b) is incorrect because the effects doctrine is not about a link with the harmful conduct but rather about the effects of that conduct within a state's territory.
4. Option c) is incorrect because the effects doctrine is not based on the nationality of the offender.
5. Option d) is correct because the effects doctrine specifically confers jurisdiction to the state where the conduct produces effects, even if the conduct occurred outside its territory.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which persons are considered as 'de facto' organs of the State under the law of international responsibility, I will analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a**: This describes individuals empowered by law to exercise governmental authority. However, this refers to 'de jure' organs, not 'de facto' organs, as 'de facto' organs are not necessarily empowered by law but act under the State's control or direction.

2. **Option b**: This describes persons who, in fact, act on the instructions, direction, or control of the State. This aligns with the concept of 'de facto' organs, as they are not formally recognized as State organs but their actions are attributable to the State due to the control or direction exercised by the State.

3. **Option c**: This refers to 'de jure' organs acting without authority or ultra vires. While such acts may still be attributable to the State, this does not define 'de facto' organs.

4. **Option d**: This states that the acts or omissions of these organs cannot be attributed to the State. This is incorrect, as 'de facto' organs' actions are attributable to the State under international law.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a**: Custom is incorporated if it is not in conflict with existing legislation.  
   - This suggests that custom can be incorporated into English law as long as it does not contradict existing statutory or common law. This aligns with the principle that custom must be reasonable and not conflict with established law.

2. **Option b**: Custom is superior to English law and is always incorporated.  
   - This is incorrect because custom is not superior to English law. English law, particularly statutory law, takes precedence over custom.

3. **Option c**: Custom must first be recognised by Parliament before the courts can bring it into the domestic sphere.  
   - This is incorrect because custom does not require explicit recognition by Parliament. Courts can recognize and apply custom if it meets certain criteria, such as being reasonable, certain, and longstanding.

4. **Option d**: Custom is incorporated with the passing of implementing legislation.  
   - This is incorrect because custom does not necessarily require implementing legislation to be incorporated into English law. Courts can recognize custom independently.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To answer this question, I will consider the historical context of international law prior to the United Nations Charter, which was adopted in 1945.

1. Before the United Nations Charter, the use of armed force was not entirely prohibited. There were some restrictions under international law, such as those established by the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928, which sought to outlaw war as a means of resolving disputes. However, enforcement mechanisms were weak, and states often resorted to armed force.

2. The League of Nations, established after World War I, also attempted to regulate the use of force, but its effectiveness was limited. States could still use armed force under certain conditions, such as self-defense or with the approval of the League.

3. Therefore, armed force was permitted prior to the United Nations Charter, but it was subject to some restrictions, though these restrictions were not as comprehensive or enforceable as those established by the UN Charter.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The protective principle of jurisdiction refers to a state's authority to assert jurisdiction over conduct committed abroad that threatens its national security or vital interests, even if the perpetrator is not a national of that state.
2. Option a) aligns with this definition, as it mentions jurisdiction based on harm to national interests by conduct committed abroad.
3. The other options do not match the protective principle:
   - b) refers to protecting nationals abroad, which is not the protective principle.
   - c) refers to protecting international human rights, which is unrelated to the protective principle.
   - d) refers to jurisdiction based on the nationality of the offender, which is the nationality principle, not the protective principle.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to determine the correct year of establishment for the Council of Europe. The Council of Europe was established in 1949, not 1950, 1959, or 1984.

Next, I need to verify the number of member states. The Council of Europe consists of 47 member states, not 27, 34, or 19.

Finally, combining the correct year and the correct number of member states, the correct statement is that the Council of Europe was established in 1949 and consists of 47 member states.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) suggests that achieving an equitable result is the only method international courts and tribunals follow. However, this is not accurate, as courts and tribunals use specific methodologies, such as the equidistance/relevant circumstances method, to achieve an equitable result, but it is not the sole method.

2. Option b) implies that an equitable result is based on the judge's or arbitrator's discretion (ex aequo et bono). This is incorrect because achieving an equitable result in maritime delimitation is not based on discretion but follows established legal principles and methodologies.

3. Option c) states that an equitable result is the end goal of delimitation, achieved after drawing a provisional equidistance line and adjusting it based on relevant circumstances and proportionality. This aligns with the established practice of international courts and tribunals, which aim to achieve an equitable result through this structured process.

4. Option d) claims that achieving an equitable result is an outdated method. This is incorrect, as achieving an equitable result remains a fundamental principle in maritime delimitation.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) states that derogations are exemptions from particular human rights obligations contained in a treaty. This is a plausible definition, as derogations often allow states to temporarily deviate from certain treaty obligations under specific conditions.

2. Option b) suggests that a derogation refers to the ability of rights holders to bring a claim against the State for breach of an obligation. This does not align with the concept of derogations, as it describes a legal remedy rather than an exemption or suspension of obligations.

3. Option c) explains that a State may suspend particular rights by means of a derogation in circumstances that threaten its existence. This is accurate, as derogations are typically invoked during emergencies or situations that threaten the life of the nation, allowing states to temporarily suspend certain rights.

4. Option d) claims that derogations are enforcement clauses in human rights treaties. This is incorrect, as derogations are not enforcement mechanisms but rather provisions allowing temporary suspension of obligations.

After evaluating all options, the most accurate definition is provided in option c).

"First, I need to understand the term ""act jure gestionis."" It refers to actions undertaken by a State in a private or commercial capacity, as opposed to sovereign or public acts (jure imperii). 

Next, I need to evaluate the options:
a) This option correctly describes acts jure gestionis as those undertaken by States in a private capacity.
b) This is incorrect because not all purchases by the State are necessarily acts jure gestionis; some may be sovereign acts.
c) This is incorrect because not all acts by State corporations are jure gestionis; it depends on the nature of the act.
d) This is incorrect because the conduct of government officials in their free time is not related to the concept of jure gestionis.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of cultural relativism. Cultural relativism is the idea that a person's beliefs, values, and practices should be understood based on that person's own culture, rather than judged against the criteria of another culture.

Next, I need to analyze the options. Option a) suggests that human rights apply equally to all without restrictions, which does not align with cultural relativism as it emphasizes universal application rather than cultural context. Option b) suggests that human rights have a cultural origin, which is not the focus of cultural relativism. Option c) suggests that the application of human rights is relative to the laws in each nation, which is not accurate as cultural relativism focuses on cultural context rather than legal systems. Option d) suggests that local culture should validate the existence and practice of all human rights, which aligns with the idea of cultural relativism as it emphasizes the role of local culture in understanding and validating practices.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the concept of recognition of governments in international law. Historically, recognition of governments was a significant practice, but in contemporary international practice, it has evolved.

Second, I need to evaluate the shift towards functional recognition. Functional recognition focuses on the ability of a government to effectively control its territory and fulfill international obligations, rather than formal recognition of governments.

Third, I need to analyze the options. Option a suggests that recognition of governments is very prevalent, which is not accurate in contemporary practice. Option b aligns with the shift towards functional recognition. Option c refers to rebel entities, which is not the focus of general government recognition. Option d is incorrect because recognition is not limited to democratic governments.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). It was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948.  
Next, I need to determine its legal nature. The UDHR is not a treaty, so it is not legally binding like a multilateral treaty.  
Finally, the UDHR is a resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly, which makes it a UN General Assembly resolution.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the principle under which the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) applies extraterritorially. The ECHR can apply outside the territory of member States when the State exercises effective control over an area or individuals, even if this is outside its own borders.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a is incorrect because the ECHR does not apply universally outside Europe; it depends on the specific circumstances of control. Option c is incorrect because contributing forces to a UN peacekeeping mission does not automatically trigger ECHR jurisdiction. Option d is incorrect because the ECHR does not apply based solely on historical colonial ties.

Finally, option b is correct because the ECHR applies extraterritorially in cases where a member State exercises effective control over an area or individuals, as established in case law like *Al-Skeini v. United Kingdom*.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the principle 'pacta sunt servanda'. This is a fundamental principle in international law that means ""agreements must be kept.""

Next, I need to analyze the options. Option a) refers to being aware of the terms and avoiding misinterpretation, which is not the essence of 'pacta sunt servanda'. Option b) refers to safeguarding the object and purpose of the treaty, which is related but not the core meaning. Option c) refers to adhering to the terms of the treaty in good faith, which aligns with the principle. Option d) refers to not violating the most important provisions, which is narrower than the principle's scope.

Finally, the correct interpretation of 'pacta sunt servanda' is that parties to a treaty must adhere to its terms in good faith.

"First, I need to identify the key issue in the Tin Council case, which revolves around the absence of implementing legislation in the English legal system for the Council's founding treaty.  
Next, I need to consider the legal principle that treaties do not automatically become part of domestic law unless implemented through legislation.  
Finally, the absence of implementing legislation meant that individuals could not derive rights or duties from the treaty in the English legal system.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement a**: The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) into UK law. This is correct. The Act makes the rights from the ECHR enforceable in UK courts, allowing individuals to bring cases based on these rights without needing to go to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

2. **Statement b**: The Human Rights Act 1998 allows a court to invalidate primary legislation. This is incorrect. UK courts cannot invalidate primary legislation (Acts of Parliament) under the Human Rights Act. Instead, they can issue a ""declaration of incompatibility"" if they find that a piece of legislation is inconsistent with the ECHR, but it is up to Parliament to decide whether to amend the law.

3. **Statement c**: The Human Rights Act 1998 allows any person with a reasonable case to bring a case before a court. This is incorrect. Only individuals who are ""victims"" of a breach of their rights under the ECHR can bring a case under the Human Rights Act.

4. **Statement d**: The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporates the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights into UK law. This is incorrect. The Human Rights Act is based on the ECHR, not the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The EU Charter is a separate document and was not incorporated into UK law by the Human Rights Act.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) states that reparation may take only the form of pecuniary compensation, including the interest. This is incorrect because reparation is not limited to pecuniary compensation; it can take other forms as well.

2. Option b) states that reparation denotes only the physical restitution of the wrongful act. This is also incorrect because restitution is just one form of reparation, and there are other forms like compensation and satisfaction.

3. Option c) states that reparation includes restitution, compensation, and satisfaction, either alone or alongside other forms of reparation. This is correct because international law recognizes these as the main forms of reparation, and they can be applied individually or in combination.

4. Option d) states that the form of reparation is a matter for the responsible State to decide. This is incorrect because the form of reparation is determined based on the nature of the wrongful act and the harm caused, not solely at the discretion of the responsible State.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the definition of jus cogens. Jus cogens refers to peremptory norms of international law that are universally recognized as fundamental principles from which no derogation is permitted. 

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) correctly describes jus cogens as peremptory norms that cannot be altered even with the consent of States. Option b) refers to multilateral treaties, which is not specific to jus cogens. Option c) refers to UN Security Council decisions, which are not jus cogens. Option d) refers to the rules on which the ICJ bases its decisions, which is not specific to jus cogens either.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) suggests that unilateral acts are related to State practice in the context of custom. However, unilateral acts are distinct from customary international law, which requires consistent State practice and opinio juris. Unilateral acts are independent and not necessarily tied to custom.

2. Option b) states that unilateral acts create unilateral legal obligations for the acting State. This is correct because unilateral acts, such as declarations or promises, can bind the State under international law if they are made with the intent to create legal obligations.

3. Option c) claims that unilateral acts are merely political acts without legal effect. This is incorrect because unilateral acts can have legal consequences if they meet certain criteria, such as intent and clarity.

4. Option d) suggests that unilateral acts are performed to bind a State to a treaty. This is incorrect because treaty obligations arise from agreements between States, not unilateral acts.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To answer this question, I will analyze the legal principles surrounding extra-territorial abduction and its impact on the jurisdiction of English courts:

1. Extra-territorial abduction refers to the act of forcibly bringing a person from one jurisdiction to another, often without legal authority. This raises questions about the abuse of process and the integrity of the legal system.

2. English courts have considered whether such abduction constitutes an abuse of process that would justify staying proceedings. The principle of abuse of process is designed to protect the fairness of the legal system and prevent the courts from being used improperly.

3. However, English courts have generally been reluctant to stay proceedings solely on the basis of extra-territorial abduction. While the abductor may face liability for their actions, the courts prioritize the administration of justice and the prosecution of serious crimes.

Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of 'secondary rules' in the context of international law. Secondary rules are distinct from primary rules, which establish the obligations of states under international law.

Next, secondary rules specifically address the legal consequences that arise when primary rules are breached. This includes issues such as attribution, reparation, and countermeasures, but they are not limited to any one of these aspects exclusively.

Finally, based on the options provided, the most accurate description of secondary rules is that they govern the legal consequences arising from a breach of primary rules, i.e., the international obligations of states.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The doctrine of incorporation generally refers to the idea that international treaties, once ratified, automatically become part of domestic law without requiring additional legislative action.
2. This means that treaties do not need to undergo a separate process of legislative transformation to be enforceable domestically.
3. Based on this understanding, the correct answer is the option that states that ratified treaties automatically pass into the sphere of domestic law.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issues provisional measures under Article 41 of its Statute. These measures are intended to preserve the rights of the parties pending the final decision in a case.

2. Historically, there was debate about whether these measures were binding. However, in the **LaGrand case (2001)**, the ICJ explicitly stated that provisional measures are binding upon the parties. This marked a significant clarification in international law.

3. Since the LaGrand case, the ICJ has consistently reaffirmed that provisional measures are binding, and states are obligated to comply with them.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine when countermeasures are illegal, I will analyze the options step by step:

1. Countermeasures are actions taken by a state in response to another state's wrongful act, aiming to induce compliance with international obligations. However, they must adhere to certain legal principles under international law.
2. Option a) states that countermeasures are illegal when they are disproportionate or violate peremptory norms of international law, such as the prohibition of the use of force or fundamental human rights. This aligns with established principles of international law, as countermeasures must not breach jus cogens norms or be excessive.
3. Option b) suggests countermeasures are illegal during armed conflict. However, countermeasures are not inherently prohibited in such situations, provided they comply with international law.
4. Option c) claims countermeasures are illegal if they violate bilateral treaties. This is incorrect because countermeasures may involve suspending treaty obligations as a response to a breach, provided they meet legal criteria.
5. Option d) states countermeasures are illegal without the responsible state's consent. This is incorrect, as countermeasures are typically taken unilaterally in response to wrongful acts.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze the characteristics of political and legal means of dispute settlement. Political methods, such as negotiation, mediation, and conciliation, are generally non-binding and rely on the consent and cooperation of the parties involved. Legal methods, such as arbitration or adjudication by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), result in binding decisions that the parties are obligated to follow.

Next, I need to evaluate the options provided:
a) This option correctly states that legal methods result in final and binding outcomes, whereas political methods do not.
b) This option is incorrect because both political and legal methods require the consent of the parties to initiate the process.
c) This option is incorrect because political methods do not necessarily lead to a final settlement, whereas legal methods do.
d) This option is incorrect because the use of legal or political methods does not depend on the significance of the dispute.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the purpose of the exhaustion of local remedies in international human rights law. This principle requires individuals to first seek justice through their national legal systems before turning to international tribunals. 

Next, I consider the rationale behind this rule. It serves to respect the sovereignty of states and their judicial systems, allowing them the opportunity to address and resolve issues internally. Additionally, it helps to reduce the caseload of international tribunals by ensuring that only cases that cannot be resolved locally are brought forward.

Finally, I evaluate the options. Option c) aligns with the rationale, as it highlights both the goal of limiting the volume of petitions to international tribunals and the importance of strengthening local judicial systems.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the case that best illustrates the 'living instrument principle,' which is the idea that the European Convention on Human Rights is a dynamic and evolving document that must be interpreted in light of present-day conditions.

Next, I analyze the cases:
- **Golder v UK (1978)**: This case established the right of access to courts but does not specifically highlight the 'living instrument principle.'
- **A v UK (2009)**: This case dealt with the admissibility of evidence obtained through torture but does not focus on the 'living instrument principle.'
- **Goodwin v UK (2002)**: This case involved the rights of transgender individuals and demonstrated the 'living instrument principle' by interpreting the Convention in light of evolving societal attitudes toward gender identity.
- **Osman v UK (1998)**: This case addressed the state's duty to protect individuals from harm but does not specifically illustrate the 'living instrument principle.'

Finally, the case that best illustrates the 'living instrument principle' is **Goodwin v UK (2002)**, as it reflects the Court's approach to interpreting the Convention dynamically.

{'sol': 'c'}"
"To answer this question, let's analyze step by step:

1. The recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are not directly tied to the doctrines of incorporation or transformation, which are primarily concerned with how international treaties are applied in domestic law. These doctrines deal with the relationship between international law and domestic law, not foreign judgments.

2. The recognition of foreign judgments often depends on the existence of bilateral or multilateral treaties, but this is not always the case. In many jurisdictions, foreign judgments can be recognized and enforced even in the absence of such treaties, based on principles of comity or reciprocity.

3. Courts often exercise discretion in recognizing and enforcing foreign judgments, guided by the principle of comity. Comity refers to the mutual respect and recognition of legal systems, provided certain conditions (such as fairness, jurisdiction, and public policy) are met.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the context of the Pinochet case. The case revolved around the issue of whether former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet could claim immunity from prosecution for acts of torture and other crimes committed during his time in office.

Next, I need to analyze the legal principles involved. The House of Lords examined the concept of immunity for heads of state, distinguishing between personal immunity (immunity ratione personae) and functional immunity (immunity ratione materiae). Personal immunity applies to sitting heads of state, while functional immunity applies to acts performed in an official capacity.

Finally, the House of Lords concluded that former heads of state do not enjoy personal immunity once they leave office, and certain acts, such as torture, cannot be considered official acts that would be protected by functional immunity.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze each statement to determine its accuracy.

a) The war crimes trials at Nuremberg and Tokyo took place after the Second World War, not the First World War. This statement is false.

b) The war crimes trials did introduce the concept of ""crimes against humanity"" as an offence. This statement is true.

c) The war crimes trials held individuals legally responsible for acts such as war crimes and crimes against humanity, establishing the principle of individual accountability. This statement is true.

d) The war crimes trials determined that ""superior orders"" could not be used as a defense for war crimes or crimes against humanity, though it could be considered in mitigation of punishment. This statement is true.

Therefore, the false statement is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the question step by step:

1. The high seas are areas of the ocean that are not under the jurisdiction of any single State. According to international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the high seas are open to all States, and no State may claim sovereignty over them.

2. The principle of ""flag State jurisdiction"" applies to vessels on the high seas. This means that the State whose flag a vessel is flying (the flag State) has exclusive jurisdiction over that vessel. However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as in cases of piracy, unauthorized broadcasting, or when a vessel is stateless.

3. Based on the above, the correct answer must reflect the principle of flag State jurisdiction while acknowledging the exceptions. Therefore, the correct choice is: c) The flag State is to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over its vessels on the high seas, with the exception of specific cases, such as piracy.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the question step by step:

1. Treaties are formal agreements between states or international entities, but their validity does not necessarily depend on their form or designation. 
2. International law recognizes that treaties can take various forms, such as written agreements, oral agreements, or even informal arrangements, as long as the parties intend to be legally bound.
3. Therefore, treaties do not have to assume a particular form or be explicitly designated as ""treaties"" to be valid under international law.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of monist theory in the context of legal philosophy. Monism suggests that there is a single, unified legal system.

Next, I analyze the options. Option a) suggests international law is superior, which is not the fundamental premise of monism. Option b) aligns with the idea that international and domestic law are part of the same legal order, which is the core of monist theory. Option c) suggests domestic laws are superior, which is contrary to monism. Option d) suggests no clashes occur, which is not a defining feature of monism.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Article 38 of the ICJ Statute refers to ""general principles of law recognized by civilized nations."" This does not mean principles recognized only by the most civilized nations, so option (a) is incorrect.

2. The phrase refers to principles that are common to the major legal systems of the world, such as fairness, justice, and equity. These principles are not limited to international law but are derived from domestic legal systems. This aligns with option (b).

3. Option (c) refers to general principles of international law recognized by international courts and tribunals, but this is not the same as the ""general principles of law"" mentioned in Article 38, which are derived from domestic legal systems.

4. Option (d) suggests that the principles must be recognized by all nations, but Article 38 does not require universal recognition, only recognition by ""civilized nations.""

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine when an illegal act of violence on the high seas falls short of qualifying as piracy, I will analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a**: Piracy typically involves acts committed against private vessels, not public vessels of another State. However, this does not mean that acts against public vessels cannot qualify as piracy under certain circumstances. This option does not fully address the question.

2. **Option b**: The requirement of ""private ends"" is a key element in the definition of piracy under international law (e.g., UNCLOS). If an act is not committed for private ends, it may not qualify as piracy. However, this option alone does not address the full scope of the question.

3. **Option c**: Acts committed by a warship, even if the crew has mutinied, can still qualify as piracy if the act meets the criteria (e.g., private ends, against another vessel). This option does not fully explain when an act falls short of piracy.

4. **Option d**: For an act to qualify as piracy, it must generally be committed against another vessel and for private ends. If neither of these conditions is met, the act does not qualify as piracy. This option directly addresses the question.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the meaning of ""armed attack"" in Article 51 of the UN Charter, let's analyze step by step:

1. Article 51 of the UN Charter provides the right to self-defense if an ""armed attack"" occurs against a member state. However, not all uses of force qualify as an ""armed attack."" The term is generally interpreted to mean a significant or high-intensity use of force, such as large-scale military actions.

2. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Nicaragua case clarified that not all uses of force constitute an ""armed attack."" For example, minor border skirmishes or low-intensity actions may not meet the threshold of an ""armed attack.""

3. While terrorist attacks can sometimes qualify as ""armed attacks"" (e.g., the 9/11 attacks), this is not universally applicable. Additionally, an ""armed attack"" does not automatically give a state the right to invade the aggressor state; the response must be necessary and proportionate under international law.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) suggests that a State is 'injured' if it has suffered damage from the internationally wrongful conduct. While damage is relevant, the concept of an 'injured State' in international law is broader and not limited to actual damage.

2. Option b) states that a State is 'injured' in cases of a violation of a peremptory norm of international law. While violations of peremptory norms are serious, this does not automatically make a State 'injured' unless specific obligations owed to it are breached.

3. Option c) claims that a State is 'injured' if it acknowledges the existence of the internationally wrongful conduct. This is incorrect because acknowledgment does not determine whether a State is 'injured.'

4. Option d) defines an 'injured State' as one where the obligation breached was owed to it individually or to a group of States, including that State, and it was specially affected. This aligns with the definition provided in the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), specifically Article 42.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Personal (ratione personae) immunity refers to immunity granted to individuals based on their personal status or position, rather than the nature of their actions. This immunity typically applies to high-ranking officials such as heads of state, heads of government, and foreign ministers.

2. Option a) suggests that personal immunity is afforded to all physical persons. This is incorrect because personal immunity is not granted to all individuals, but only to specific persons holding certain positions.

3. Option b) states that personal immunity is afforded in a personal capacity and does not cover conduct of the State as such. This is misleading because personal immunity does cover both private and official acts of the individual while they are in office.

4. Option c) claims that personal immunity is afforded only to particular persons irrespective of whether their conduct was undertaken in a private or public capacity. This is correct because personal immunity protects certain individuals (e.g., heads of state) from legal proceedings for both private and official acts while they are in office.

5. Option d) suggests that personal immunity is afforded to State officials for conduct undertaken in a public capacity. This is incorrect because personal immunity applies to certain individuals regardless of whether their actions are private or public.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the role and function of the UN Human Rights Council. The Council is responsible for promoting and protecting human rights globally and addressing human rights violations.

Next, I need to analyze the choices:
a) The Council does not have the power to impose economic sanctions; this is typically the role of the UN Security Council.
b) The Council does scrutinize the human rights records of all UN member states through mechanisms like the Universal Periodic Review.
c) The Council replaced the UN Commission on Human Rights, not the Economic and Social Committee.
d) The Council consists of 47 member states, not 27.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine when a reservation is considered invalid under the law of treaties, I will analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a**: A reservation is invalid when the majority of the State parties objects to it.  
   - This is not correct because the validity of a reservation is not determined by the number of objections from State parties. Instead, objections may affect the relationship between the reserving State and the objecting State but do not inherently make the reservation invalid.

2. **Option b**: A reservation is invalid only when an international tribunal says so.  
   - This is not entirely accurate. While an international tribunal may rule on the validity of a reservation in a specific case, the invalidity of a reservation is primarily determined by its compatibility with the treaty's object and purpose or with jus cogens norms, not solely by a tribunal's decision.

3. **Option c**: A reservation is invalid only when it is incompatible with a peremptory norm of international law (jus cogens).  
   - This is partially correct. A reservation that conflicts with a jus cogens norm is indeed invalid. However, this is not the only criterion for invalidity under the law of treaties.

4. **Option d**: A reservation is invalid when it is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty.  
   - This is correct. According to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (Article 19), a reservation is invalid if it is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty. This is a fundamental principle in determining the validity of reservations.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Coastal States have specific rights over their continental shelf as defined under international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). These rights are inherent and do not require a declaration or action by the State to establish them.

2. The rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf are primarily for the purpose of exploring and exploiting its natural resources, such as mineral and non-living resources of the seabed and subsoil, as well as sedentary species.

3. These rights are sovereign rights, meaning they are exclusive to the coastal State and do not depend on the consent of neighboring States. The rights are not limited to fishing resources but extend to all natural resources of the continental shelf.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. Article 103 of the UN Charter states that in the event of a conflict between the obligations of UN member states under the Charter and their obligations under any other international agreement, the obligations under the Charter shall prevail.
2. However, jus cogens norms (peremptory norms of international law) are universally recognized principles from which no derogation is permitted. These norms are considered superior to all other international agreements, including the UN Charter.
3. Therefore, while Article 103 gives precedence to the UN Charter over other treaties, it cannot override jus cogens norms.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To answer this question, let's analyze step by step:

1. International law establishes that states cannot invoke their domestic law as a justification for failing to perform their international obligations. This principle is enshrined in Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
2. Obligations under international law, including treaties and customary international law, take precedence over conflicting domestic laws. This ensures that states cannot use their internal legal systems to evade their international responsibilities.
3. Therefore, the correct answer is that obligations under international law prevail over domestic law.

{'sol': 'c'}"
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) states that implied powers are those necessary for an organisation to carry out its tasks, even if they are not explicitly mentioned in its charter. This aligns with the general understanding of implied powers in legal and institutional contexts, where such powers are inferred to ensure the effective functioning of the organisation.

2. Option b) suggests that implied powers are new powers assumed unilaterally by the organisation. This is incorrect because implied powers are not about unilateral assumptions but about powers inferred from the existing framework.

3. Option c) claims that implied powers are conferred by the international community. This is not accurate because implied powers are derived from the organisation's charter and its functions, not directly granted by the international community.

4. Option d) states that implied powers depend on an expansive interpretation of the charter. While this may sometimes be true, it is not the defining characteristic of implied powers. The key aspect is their necessity for carrying out the organisation's tasks.

The most accurate definition is provided in option a). Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze the criteria for statehood under the 1933 Montevideo Convention step by step:

1. The Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States outlines the criteria for statehood in Article 1. It specifies four essential elements: a permanent population, a defined territory, a government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states.

2. The other options, such as requiring recognition by the majority of nations (b), or requiring stable and indissoluble borders (d), are not part of the Montevideo Convention's criteria. Recognition is a separate issue and not a formal requirement under the convention.

3. The option about being peaceful and not an aggressor (a) is also not a criterion under the Montevideo Convention.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
