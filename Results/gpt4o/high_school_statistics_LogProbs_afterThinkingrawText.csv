"To determine the P-value of the test, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the hypothesis test**: The null hypothesis \( H_0 \) is that the mean weight of the tablets is 300 milligrams. The alternative hypothesis \( H_a \) could be two-sided (mean is not 300 mg) or one-sided (mean is greater or less than 300 mg). Based on the choices, it seems to be a two-sided test.

2. **Calculate the test statistic**: The test statistic follows a \( t \)-distribution because the sample size is small (\( n = 7 \)) and the population standard deviation is unknown. The degrees of freedom (\( df \)) for the \( t \)-distribution is \( n - 1 = 6 \).

3. **Interpret the P-value**: For a two-sided test, the P-value is \( 2P(t > |t_{\text{stat}}|) \), where \( t_{\text{stat}} \) is the calculated test statistic. The degrees of freedom used in the calculation is \( df = 6 \).

Thus, the correct choice is **b) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6**.

"To solve this, I will use the properties of the normal distribution and the empirical rule.

1. First, I know that the waiting times are normally distributed with a mean of 35 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes. The total number of riders is 150,000, and I need to find the shortest time interval that includes 100,000 riders. This means I need to find the interval that contains approximately 100,000 / 150,000 = 2/3 (or 66.67%) of the data.

2. In a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean. This corresponds to the interval from (mean - 1 standard deviation) to (mean + 1 standard deviation), which is 35 - 10 = 25 minutes to 35 + 10 = 45 minutes. However, I need to check the specific intervals provided in the choices.

3. I will calculate the z-scores and probabilities for the given intervals to determine which one corresponds to approximately 66.67% of the data. After analyzing the intervals, the shortest one that includes approximately 66.67% of the riders is 25.3 to 44.7 minutes.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze each statement to determine its validity for all discrete random variables.  
a) Discrete random variables must have numerical outcomes, as they represent countable values. This statement is true.  
b) The possible outcomes of a discrete random variable must be mutually exclusive, meaning no two outcomes can occur simultaneously. This statement is true.  
c) The mean (expected value) of a discrete random variable is calculated as the sum of the products of each value and its corresponding probability. This statement is true.  
d) The statement about 95% of outcomes being within two standard deviations of the mean is related to the empirical rule, which applies to normal distributions. However, not all discrete random variables follow a normal distribution. This statement is not true for all discrete random variables.  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

a) If there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 10% level, then there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 5% level.  
- This is incorrect because the 5% level is more stringent than the 10% level. If a null hypothesis is rejected at the 10% level, it does not necessarily mean it will be rejected at the 5% level.

b) Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered.  
- This is incorrect because the decision to use a one- or two-sided test should be made before collecting data to avoid bias in the analysis.

c) If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.  
- This is incorrect because the 1% level refers to the significance level, which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (Type I error). It does not mean there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis overall.

d) The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.  
- This is correct. The power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. It measures the test's ability to detect an effect if there is one.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the definition of an outlier. An outlier is a data point that is significantly different from the other observations in a dataset. 

Next, I will evaluate the choices:
a) This is incorrect because an outlier is not defined by frequency.
b) This is incorrect because an outlier is not necessarily less frequent.
c) This is incorrect because an outlier can be either smaller or larger than other observations.
d) This is correct because an outlier is defined as being significantly different from the other observations.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a**: This statement is incorrect because the confidence interval does not provide information about the percentage of students or families within the interval. It is about the mean income, not individual incomes.

2. **Option b**: This is also incorrect because the confidence interval does not make a statement about the probability of all families' incomes being within the interval. It is about the mean income estimate.

3. **Option c**: This is incorrect because the confidence interval is specific to the sample data collected. If another sample is taken, the interval might change, though 95% of such intervals would contain the true mean.

4. **Option d**: This is the correct interpretation. A 95% confidence interval means that we are 95% confident that the true mean income per family in the school lies between $35,095 and $45,005.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the significance level and Type I error**: The significance level (α) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. This is the probability of a Type I error. Since the researchers are using a fixed significance level of 0.05, the probability of a Type I error will not change regardless of the sample size.

2. **Understand the effect of increasing sample size**: Increasing the sample size reduces the variability of the sampling distribution, making it easier to detect a true effect. This means the probability of a Type II error (failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false) will decrease, and the power of the test (1 - probability of a Type II error) will increase.

3. **Evaluate the options**: 
   - a) Incorrect: The probability of a Type I error does not decrease because it is fixed at 0.05, and only the probability of a Type II error decreases.
   - b) Incorrect: The probability of a Type I error does not increase, and the power increases, not the probability of a Type I error.
   - c) Incorrect: The probability of a Type II error decreases, not increases, and the power increases.
   - d) Correct: The probability of a Type I error stays the same (fixed at 0.05), and the power increases due to the larger sample size.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine who is more unusually tall within their respective sex, we need to calculate the z-scores for both the man and the woman. The z-score is calculated as:

z = (X - μ) / σ

where X is the individual's height, μ is the mean height, and σ is the standard deviation.

Step 1: Calculate the z-score for the man.
The man's height is 74 inches, the mean height for men is 70 inches, and the standard deviation is 4 inches.
z = (74 - 70) / 4 = 4 / 4 = 1

Step 2: Calculate the z-score for the woman.
The woman's height is 70 inches, the mean height for women is 66 inches, and the standard deviation is 3 inches.
z = (70 - 66) / 3 = 4 / 3 ≈ 1.33

Step 3: Compare the z-scores.
The woman's z-score (1.33) is higher than the man's z-score (1), meaning the woman is more unusually tall within her respective sex.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which statement is not true about t-distributions, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: ""There are different t-distributions for different values of df (degrees of freedom).""  
   This is true. The shape of the t-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom, with larger degrees of freedom making the t-distribution closer to the standard normal distribution.

2. **Option b**: ""t-distributions are bell-shaped and symmetric.""  
   This is true. Like the normal distribution, t-distributions are symmetric and have a bell-shaped curve.

3. **Option c**: ""t-distributions always have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.""  
   This is not true. While t-distributions always have a mean of 0, their standard deviation depends on the degrees of freedom and is generally greater than 1 for smaller degrees of freedom. As the degrees of freedom increase, the standard deviation approaches 1.

4. **Option d**: ""t-distributions are more spread out than the normal distribution.""  
   This is true. T-distributions have heavier tails compared to the normal distribution, meaning they are more spread out, especially for smaller degrees of freedom.

The statement that is not true is option c.  
Answer: {'sol': 'c'}"
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The study involves measuring reaction times before and after consuming alcohol. This indicates that the same subjects are being tested under two different conditions (before and after alcohol consumption), which suggests that the subjects are serving as their own controls.

2. The study is not observational because the researchers are actively intervening by giving the subjects alcohol and then measuring their reaction times. Observational studies do not involve such interventions.

3. Blocking is a technique used to reduce variability in experiments by grouping similar subjects together. In this case, the subjects are their own controls, so blocking is not relevant.

4. The placebo effect could be relevant in studies involving alcohol, as subjects might behave differently if they believe they have consumed alcohol. However, the question does not provide information about whether a placebo was used, so this is not the focus of the correct answer.

Based on this reasoning, the correct statement is that this study was an experiment in which the subjects were used as their own controls.

"First, I need to analyze the definitions provided in the choices. Bias generally refers to a systematic error or deviation in results or inferences from the truth. 

Next, I need to evaluate each option:
- Option a) describes bias as a process that creates estimates that are systematically too high or too low, which aligns with the concept of bias in statistical estimation.
- Option b) describes bias as a process that results in a sample that does not represent the population, which is related to sampling bias.
- Option c) describes bias as a lack of randomization in the sampling process, which is a specific cause of bias but not a complete definition.
- Option d) describes bias as a sample that is not representative of the population, which is a result of bias but not a full explanation.

Finally, the most accurate and complete explanation of bias is provided in option a). 

{'sol': 'a'}"
"To solve this, I need to understand what a Type I error is. A Type I error occurs when a true null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected. In this case, the null hypothesis would be that the tissue strength is within specifications. 

Step 1: If a Type I error occurs, it means the null hypothesis is rejected even though it is true. This would result in halting the production process unnecessarily.

Step 2: Halting the production process unnecessarily would happen when the tissue strength is actually within specifications, but the process is stopped due to a mistaken conclusion.

Step 3: Among the choices, the correct description of a Type I error is ""Halting the production process when the tissue strength is within specifications.""

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the mean longevity of the population based on the given information. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Understand the problem**: We are told that 30% of the people live longer than 75 years. This means that 75 years corresponds to the 70th percentile of the normal distribution (since 100% - 30% = 70%).

2. **Find the z-score for the 70th percentile**: Using a z-table or standard normal distribution table, the z-score corresponding to the 70th percentile is approximately **0.5244**.

3. **Use the z-score formula**: The z-score formula is:
   \[
   z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
   \]
   Here, \( z = 0.5244 \), \( X = 75 \), and \( \sigma = 14 \). Rearranging the formula to solve for the mean (\( \mu \)):
   \[
   \mu = X - z \cdot \sigma
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \mu = 75 - 0.5244 \cdot 14
   \]

4. **Simplify the expression**: The mean longevity is expressed as \( 75 - 0.5244(14) \).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's think step by step:

1. A confidence interval's size is determined by the confidence level, the sample size, and the variability in the data. Increasing the confidence level (e.g., from 90% to 99%) means we want to be more certain that the interval contains the true population proportion. This requires a wider interval.

2. The width of the confidence interval is proportional to the critical value (z-score) associated with the confidence level. For a 90% confidence level, the z-score is approximately 1.645, while for a 99% confidence level, the z-score is approximately 2.576.

3. The increase in the interval size is not linear but depends on the ratio of the z-scores. The ratio of the z-scores is approximately 2.576 / 1.645 ≈ 1.57, meaning the interval size increases by about 57%.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which of the options is a binomial random variable, I need to check if the situation satisfies the conditions of a binomial experiment: (1) there are a fixed number of trials, (2) each trial has only two possible outcomes (success or failure), (3) the probability of success is constant for each trial, and (4) the trials are independent.

Step 1: Analyze option a) The number of tosses before a ""5"" appears when tossing a fair die.
- This is not a binomial random variable because the number of trials is not fixed; it depends on when the ""5"" appears. This is a geometric random variable.

Step 2: Analyze option b) The number of points a hockey team receives in 10 games.
- This is not a binomial random variable because there are more than two possible outcomes for each game (win, tie, or loss). A binomial random variable requires only two outcomes (success or failure).

Step 3: Analyze option c) The number of hearts out of five cards randomly drawn from a deck of 52 cards, without replacement.
- This is not a binomial random variable because the trials are not independent. When cards are drawn without replacement, the probability of drawing a heart changes after each draw.

Step 4: Analyze option d) The number of motorists not wearing seat belts in a random sample of five drivers.
- This is a binomial random variable because there is a fixed number of trials (5 drivers), each trial has two outcomes (wearing a seat belt or not), the probability of not wearing a seat belt is constant for each driver, and the trials are independent.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which factors increase the power of a hypothesis test, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Increasing the sample size (I):**  
   Increasing the sample size reduces the standard error, which makes the test statistic more sensitive to detecting true effects. This increases the power of the hypothesis test.

2. **Increasing the significance level (II):**  
   A higher significance level (e.g., moving from 0.05 to 0.10) makes it easier to reject the null hypothesis, which increases the power of the test. However, this also increases the probability of a Type I error.

3. **Increasing the probability of a Type II error (III):**  
   The power of a test is defined as \(1 - \beta\), where \(\beta\) is the probability of a Type II error. Increasing the probability of a Type II error (\(\beta\)) decreases the power of the test, so this does not increase the power.

From this analysis, both I and II increase the power of the hypothesis test, while III does not.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement I**: In order to use a χ² procedure, the expected value for each cell of a one- or two-way table must be at least 5.  
   - This is a standard condition for the χ² test to ensure the approximation to the χ² distribution is valid. If any expected value is less than 5, the test may not be reliable.  
   - **Statement I is true.**

2. **Statement II**: In order to use χ² procedures, you must have at least 2 degrees of freedom.  
   - This is incorrect. You can perform a χ² test with 1 degree of freedom (e.g., in a 2 × 2 table). There is no requirement for at least 2 degrees of freedom.  
   - **Statement II is false.**

3. **Statement III**: In a 4 × 2 two-way table, the number of degrees of freedom is 3.  
   - The formula for degrees of freedom in a two-way table is:  
     \((\text{number of rows} - 1) \times (\text{number of columns} - 1)\).  
     For a 4 × 2 table:  
     \((4 - 1) \times (2 - 1) = 3 \times 1 = 3\).  
   - **Statement III is true.**

Now, combining the true statements: I and III are true.  
The correct answer is **b) I and III only**.

{'sol': 'b'}"
"To solve this, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a: p + q > 1**  
   This is possible because probabilities of two events can add up to more than 1, as long as they are not mutually exclusive. For example, if p = 0.7 and q = 0.6, then p + q = 1.3, which is valid if the events overlap.

2. **Option b: p - q < 0**  
   This is possible because p - q < 0 implies that p < q. Probabilities can have such a relationship, for example, if p = 0.3 and q = 0.5, then p - q = -0.2, which is valid.

3. **Option c: p / q > 1**  
   This is possible because p / q > 1 implies that p > q. Probabilities can have such a relationship, for example, if p = 0.6 and q = 0.4, then p / q = 1.5, which is valid.

4. **Option d: E and F are both independent and mutually exclusive**  
   This is impossible. If two events are mutually exclusive, the occurrence of one event means the other cannot occur, which makes their probabilities dependent. Independence requires that the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other, which contradicts mutual exclusivity.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this problem, I will calculate the total probability of an accident on Highway 48 today by considering both possible weather conditions (dry and wet) and their respective probabilities.

1. First, I calculate the probability of an accident if the weather is dry. The probability of dry weather is 80% (1 - 0.2), and the probability of an accident in dry weather is 0.2% (0.002). So, the contribution to the total probability from dry weather is:
   \( P(\text{Dry}) \times P(\text{Accident | Dry}) = 0.8 \times 0.002 = 0.0016 \).

2. Next, I calculate the probability of an accident if the weather is wet. The probability of wet weather is 20% (0.2), and the probability of an accident in wet weather is 1.0% (0.01). So, the contribution to the total probability from wet weather is:
   \( P(\text{Wet}) \times P(\text{Accident | Wet}) = 0.2 \times 0.01 = 0.002 \).

3. Finally, I add the contributions from both weather conditions to find the total probability of an accident:
   \( P(\text{Accident}) = 0.0016 + 0.002 = 0.0036 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which scenario is appropriate for a binomial distribution, I need to consider the characteristics of a binomial distribution. A binomial distribution applies when there are a fixed number of trials, each trial has only two possible outcomes (success or failure), the probability of success is constant for each trial, and the trials are independent.

Step 1: Analyze option a) ""The number of minutes in an hour for which the Dow-Jones average is above its beginning average for the day.""  
This does not fit the binomial distribution because the number of minutes is not a fixed number of trials, and the outcomes are not binary (success/failure).

Step 2: Analyze option b) ""The number of cities among the 10 largest in New York State for which the weather is cloudy for most of a given day.""  
This does not fit the binomial distribution because the weather in one city may not be independent of the weather in another city, and the probability of cloudy weather may not be constant across cities.

Step 3: Analyze option c) ""The number of drivers wearing seat belts if 10 consecutive drivers are stopped at a police roadblock.""  
This fits the binomial distribution because there is a fixed number of trials (10 drivers), each driver either wears a seat belt (success) or does not (failure), the probability of wearing a seat belt is constant for each driver, and the drivers are independent of each other.

Step 4: Analyze option d) ""None of the above.""  
Since option c fits the binomial distribution, this option is incorrect.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To find the residual for the given point, I need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the predicted value of y** using the regression equation \( y = -2.29 + 1.70x \). Substituting \( x = 5 \), the predicted value is:
   \[
   y_{\text{predicted}} = -2.29 + 1.70(5) = -2.29 + 8.5 = 6.21
   \]

2. **Find the residual** by subtracting the predicted value from the actual value of \( y \). The residual is:
   \[
   \text{Residual} = y_{\text{actual}} - y_{\text{predicted}} = 6 - 6.21 = -0.21
   \]

3. **Verify the calculation** to ensure accuracy. The predicted value is indeed 6.21, and the residual is \( -0.21 \).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze the choices to determine which one correctly explains why t should be used instead of z for inference procedures for means.  
Next, I note that the t-distribution accounts for the additional variability introduced when the sample standard deviation is used to estimate the population standard deviation.  
Finally, I recognize that this additional variability makes the t-distribution more appropriate for inference about means, especially with smaller sample sizes.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which option is least likely to reduce bias in a sample survey, let's analyze each choice step by step:

1. **Option a)** Following up with those who did not respond to the survey the first time can help reduce nonresponse bias, as it ensures that the sample better represents the population by including individuals who might otherwise be excluded.

2. **Option b)** Asking questions in a neutral manner is crucial to avoid response bias, where the way questions are phrased might influence participants' answers. This step directly reduces bias in the survey.

3. **Option c)** Using stratified random sampling rather than simple random sampling can reduce bias by ensuring that specific subgroups of the population are adequately represented in the sample.

4. **Option d)** Selecting samples randomly is a fundamental principle of reducing selection bias, as it ensures that every individual in the population has an equal chance of being included in the sample.

After evaluating all options, **option c** is least likely to reduce bias because while stratified random sampling can improve representation, it is not inherently better at reducing bias compared to simple random sampling. Both methods aim to reduce bias, but stratified sampling is more about improving precision and representation.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correlation between the numbers of hours students studied for each exam, we need to consider the relationship between the two variables (hours studied for the first exam and hours studied for the second exam).

1. For the first exam, the students studied an average of 4 hours with a standard deviation of 1 hour. This means there was variability in the number of hours studied for the first exam.
2. For the second exam, every student studied exactly 10 hours. Since all students studied the same amount of time, there is no variability in the number of hours studied for the second exam (standard deviation = 0).
3. Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. However, if one of the variables has no variability (standard deviation = 0), the correlation is undefined or effectively 0 because there is no meaningful relationship to measure.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand how adding a constant value to all data points affects the standard deviation. Adding a constant value to all data points does not change the spread of the data, so the standard deviation remains the same.

Next, I confirm that the $5,000 increase is a constant added to all house values, which means it does not affect the variability or spread of the data.

Finally, since the original standard deviation is $23,000 and adding a constant does not change it, the new standard deviation will still be $23,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to calculate the total salary paid to office assistants in each office. For the New Jersey office, the total salary is $28,500 * 128 = $3,648,000. For the Utah office, the total salary is $22,500 * 32 = $720,000.

Next, I calculate the total salary paid to all office assistants in the company by adding the totals from both offices: $3,648,000 + $720,000 = $4,368,000.

Now, I calculate the total number of office assistants in the company: 128 + 32 = 160.

Finally, I find the mean salary by dividing the total salary by the total number of office assistants: $4,368,000 ÷ 160 = $27,300.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the false statement, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: A sample must be reasonably large to be properly considered a simple random sample.  
   - This is false. The size of the sample does not determine whether it is a simple random sample. A simple random sample is defined by the method of selection, where every element of the population has an equal chance of being chosen, regardless of the sample size.

2. **Option b**: Inspection of a sample will give no indication of whether or not it is a simple random sample.  
   - This is true. You cannot determine if a sample is a simple random sample just by inspecting it; you need to know how the sample was selected.

3. **Option c**: Attributes of a simple random sample may be very different from attributes of the population.  
   - This is true. A simple random sample may not always perfectly represent the population, especially if the sample size is small.

4. **Option d**: Every element of the population has an equal chance of being picked.  
   - This is true. This is the defining characteristic of a simple random sample.

"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The associate is dividing the customers into groups based on the first letter of their names (A, B, C, etc.), and then randomly selecting 4 customers from each group. This means the selection process involves chance, as random numbers are used to pick names within each group.

2. However, this procedure does not result in a simple random sample. A simple random sample requires that every possible subset of 104 customers has an equal chance of being selected. In this case, the selection is constrained by the grouping based on the first letter of the names, so it is not a simple random sample.

3. Since the selection is based on the first letter of the names, customers whose names begin with letters that have fewer than 4 customers will always be included, while customers in groups with more than 4 names have a lower probability of being selected. Therefore, not every customer has an equal probability of being included in the survey.

4. The procedure introduces bias because the selection is influenced by the distribution of names across the alphabet, which may not be representative of the entire population. This is a form of sampling bias, not just sampling error.

The correct conclusion is: {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate the expected return for each option and analyze the conditions provided in the choices.

1. **Option I**: The return is a sure $25,000. The expected return is $25,000.

2. **Option II**: There is a 50% chance of $50,000 and a 50% chance of $10,000. The expected return is:
   (0.5 * $50,000) + (0.5 * $10,000) = $25,000 + $5,000 = $30,000.

3. **Option III**: There is a 5% chance of $100,000 and a 95% chance of $0. The expected return is:
   (0.05 * $100,000) + (0.95 * $0) = $5,000.

Now, let's analyze the choices:
- **a)** Option II has the highest expected return ($30,000), so it is correct if the company wants to maximize expected return.
- **b)** Option I guarantees $25,000, which is sufficient to pay off a $20,000 loan. This is correct.
- **c)** Option III has only a 5% chance of returning $100,000, which is the only option that could potentially pay off an $80,000 loan. This is correct.
- **d)** Since all the above answers are correct, this is also correct.

"To determine the most representative sample, I need to consider the geographical variation in musical tastes and ensure that the sample reflects the distribution of customers across different states.

1. Option a) only includes customers who joined in the last month, which does not account for the entire 12-month period and is not representative of all customers who joined in the past year.
2. Option b) involves choosing a random sample from all customers who joined in the last 12 months. While this is better than option a), it does not account for geographical variation in musical tastes.
3. Option c) involves classifying customers by state and choosing 10 customers from each state. This ensures geographical representation but may not be proportional to the number of customers in each state, leading to overrepresentation of states with fewer customers and underrepresentation of states with more customers.
4. Option d) involves classifying customers by state and choosing 3% of the customers from each state. This ensures both geographical representation and proportionality, making it the most representative sample plan.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the upper critical value of z for a 94% confidence interval:

1. The confidence level is 94%, which means the remaining 6% is split equally in the two tails of the standard normal distribution. Each tail will have 3% (0.03) of the area.
2. To find the z-value corresponding to the upper critical value, we need the cumulative area to the left of the z-value. This is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97.
3. Using a z-table or standard normal distribution calculator, the z-value corresponding to a cumulative area of 0.97 is approximately 1.88.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the most appropriate test for comparing the mean salaries of the math and English teachers, I will consider the following steps:

1. **Identify the type of data and comparison**: The problem involves comparing the means of two independent groups (math teachers and English teachers). This suggests that a two-sample test is appropriate.

2. **Determine whether to use a z-test or t-test**: A z-test is typically used when the population standard deviations are known and the sample size is large. In this case, the sample size is small (7 teachers in each group), and the population standard deviations are likely unknown. Therefore, a t-test is more appropriate.

3. **Confirm the specific test**: Since we are comparing the means of two independent groups, a two-sample t-test of population means is the correct choice.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Understand the effect of increasing all prices by 50 cents**: When a constant value is added to all data points in a dataset, the mean of the dataset increases by that constant value. However, the range (difference between the maximum and minimum values) and the standard deviation (which measures the spread of the data) remain unchanged because the relative differences between the data points do not change.

2. **Effect on the mean price**: The mean price of $14.75 will increase by 50 cents, resulting in a new mean price of $14.75 + $0.50 = $15.25.

3. **Effect on the range and standard deviation**: The range of prices, which is $29.99 - $3.99 = $26.00, will remain the same because the increase is uniform across all prices. Similarly, the standard deviation will remain unchanged because the spread of the data points relative to each other does not change.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. The problem provides the average donation ($155) and the standard deviation ($32) for a sample of 100 checks. The sample size is large enough to use the Central Limit Theorem, which allows us to calculate a confidence interval for the population mean.

2. The formula for a 95% confidence interval for the mean is:  
   \[ \text{CI} = \bar{x} \pm z \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \]  
   where \(\bar{x}\) is the sample mean, \(z\) is the z-score for a 95% confidence level (approximately 1.96), \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation, and \(n\) is the sample size.

3. Plugging in the values:  
   \[ \text{CI} = 155 \pm 1.96 \cdot \frac{32}{\sqrt{100}} \]  
   \[ \text{CI} = 155 \pm 1.96 \cdot 3.2 \]  
   \[ \text{CI} = 155 \pm 6.272 \]  
   \[ \text{CI} = (148.728, 161.272) \]  

4. This means we are 95% confident that the true average donation in November is between about $149 and $161. The correct statement is option d.

"To solve this, I will evaluate each statement step by step:

1. **Statement I**: The mean of the sampling distribution of x̄ (sample mean) is the same as the mean of the population.  
   This is true according to the central limit theorem. The expected value of the sample mean is equal to the population mean.

2. **Statement II**: The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of x̄ is the same as the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size.  
   This is also true. The standard error of the mean (σx̄) is calculated as the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).

3. **Statement III**: If the sample size is large, the shape of the sampling distribution of x̄ is approximately normal.  
   This is true as well. The central limit theorem states that regardless of the population's distribution, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approach a normal distribution as the sample size increases.

Since all three statements are correct, the correct answer includes I, II, and III. However, none of the provided choices include all three. Based on the choices, the most accurate answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze the situation. The newspaper poll and the actual vote represent two different samples: one from the survey respondents and one from the voters. The difference in percentages arises because these are two separate groups.

Next, I need to identify the type of difference described. The difference is not due to nonresponse bias (choice a), as the question does not mention individuals refusing to answer the survey. It is also not about the systematic difference between a statistic and a parameter caused by nonrandom selection (choice b), as the focus is on comparing two statistics, not a statistic and a parameter.

Finally, the difference is not about the statistic and the truth due to random sampling (choice d), as the question compares two statistics from two different samples. The correct description is that the difference arises because the same statistic (percentage against annexation) is computed from two different samples (survey respondents and voters).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, the confidence interval is given as (–0.23, –0.18), which means the difference in proportions (male - female) is negative. This indicates that the proportion of male customers interested in shopping on Sundays is less than the proportion of female customers.

Next, since the entire interval is negative, we can conclude with 95% confidence that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.

Finally, the correct interpretation aligns with the fact that the interval does not include zero, so there is a statistically significant difference between the two proportions.

{'sol': 'a'}"
"First, I need to identify the key difference between an experiment and an observational study. In an experiment, the researcher actively manipulates one or more variables to observe their effect on a response variable. This manipulation is a defining characteristic of experiments. 

Next, in an observational study, the researcher does not manipulate variables but instead observes and records data as it naturally occurs without intervention. This is the primary distinction between the two.

Finally, I need to match this understanding with the given choices. The correct choice is the one that highlights the manipulation of variables in experiments versus the passive observation in observational studies.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I need to calculate the interquartile range (IQR) for a normal distribution. 

1. The IQR is the difference between the 75th percentile (Q3) and the 25th percentile (Q1). For a standard normal distribution, the z-scores corresponding to Q1 and Q3 are approximately -0.675 and +0.675, respectively.
2. To find the actual values of Q1 and Q3 for the given distribution, I use the formula: \( X = \mu + z\sigma \), where \( \mu \) is the mean, \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation, and \( z \) is the z-score.
   - For Q1: \( X = 25 + (-0.675)(4) = 25 - 2.70 = 22.30 \).
   - For Q3: \( X = 25 + (0.675)(4) = 25 + 2.70 = 27.70 \).
3. The IQR is \( Q3 - Q1 = 27.70 - 22.30 = 5.40 \).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement a**: ""P(A ∪ B) implies events A and B are independent.""
   - The union of two events, P(A ∪ B), is calculated as P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B). This does not provide any information about the independence of A and B. Independence is defined by the condition P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B). Therefore, this statement is **false**.

2. **Statement b**: ""P(A ∪ B) = 1 implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.""
   - If P(A ∪ B) = 1, it means that at least one of the events A or B must occur. However, this does not imply that A and B are mutually exclusive. Mutually exclusive events satisfy P(A ∩ B) = 0, which is not guaranteed by P(A ∪ B) = 1. Therefore, this statement is **false**.

3. **Statement c**: ""P(A ∩ B) = 0 implies events A and B are independent.""
   - Independence is defined by the condition P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B). If P(A ∩ B) = 0, it means that A and B cannot occur together. This is the definition of mutually exclusive events, not independent events. Therefore, this statement is **false**.

4. **Statement d**: ""P(A ∩ B) = 0 implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.""
   - Mutually exclusive events are defined as events that cannot occur together, which means P(A ∩ B) = 0. This statement is consistent with the definition of mutually exclusive events. Therefore, this statement is **true**.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will use the properties of the normal distribution and the empirical rule.

1. First, calculate the z-scores for the income values $13,000 and $28,000. The z-score formula is \( z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \), where \( x \) is the value, \( \mu \) is the mean, and \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation.
   - For $13,000: z = \frac{13,000 - 20,500}{3,750} = \frac{-7,500}{3,750} = -2.0 \).
   - For $28,000: z = \frac{28,000 - 20,500}{3,750} = \frac{7,500}{3,750} = 2.0 \).

2. Next, use the z-scores to find the proportion of the population within this range. From the standard normal distribution table:
   - The proportion of data below \( z = 2.0 \) is approximately 0.9772.
   - The proportion of data below \( z = -2.0 \) is approximately 0.0228.
   - The proportion of data between \( z = -2.0 \) and \( z = 2.0 \) is \( 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544 \).

3. Finally, calculate the expected number of employees within this range. Multiply the total number of employees by the proportion:
   - \( 400 \times 0.9544 = 381.76 \), which rounds to approximately 390 employees.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I need to understand the concept of a margin of error in a poll. 

1. The margin of error indicates the range within which the true population proportion is likely to fall, given the sample proportion. In this case, the sample proportion is 43%, and the margin of error is 5%.
2. This means the true proportion of high school students who are afraid to go to school is likely to be within 43% ± 5%, which is between 38% and 48%.
3. The other options do not correctly describe the meaning of a margin of error. For example, option b refers to refusal to participate, which is unrelated to the margin of error, and option d misinterprets the concept of probability in this context.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the most appropriate technique for gathering the needed data, I will consider the following steps:

1. A census involves collecting data from every individual in the population. While this would provide complete information, it may not be practical or necessary in this case, as the population is limited to students at your high school.

2. A sample survey involves selecting a representative subset of the population to gather data. This could be a feasible option, but it may not be ideal if the goal is to compare results for all male and female students.

3. An experiment involves manipulating variables to observe effects. This is not appropriate here, as the goal is to compare existing exam results, not to test a cause-and-effect relationship.

4. An observational study involves collecting data without interference or manipulation. This is the most suitable technique, as it allows for the comparison of existing exam results for male and female students without altering any conditions.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the two studies step by step:

1. In the first study, the students were instructed to watch a specific amount of television (1 hour or 5 hours per day). This means the researchers actively assigned the conditions, which makes it an experiment. However, there is no mention of a control group (a group that does not watch television or follows a neutral condition), so it is an experiment without a control group.

2. In the second study, the students simply responded to a questionnaire about their television usage and grades. The researchers did not assign any conditions or manipulate variables; they only observed and recorded the data. This makes it an observational study.

3. Based on the above analysis, the first study is an experiment without a control group, and the second study is an observational study.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which plan is better, let's analyze the two plans step by step:

1. **Plan I**: This plan samples 30 students randomly from the entire school population of 1650 students. Since only 132 students have investments in the stock market, most of the sampled students will likely have no investments. This will result in a confidence interval that is heavily influenced by the large number of students with no investments, leading to an inaccurate estimate of the total stock market investment.

2. **Plan II**: This plan samples 30 students randomly from the 132 students who have investments in the stock market. By focusing only on the students who actually have investments, this plan will provide a more accurate estimate of the average investment among those with investments. Multiplying this average by 132 will give a better estimate of the total stock market investment by students in the school.

3. **Comparison**: Plan II is better because it directly targets the group of interest (students with investments) and avoids the dilution effect caused by including students with no investments, as in Plan I.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand what sampling error is. Sampling error occurs because a sample is used to estimate a population parameter, and the sample may not perfectly represent the population.

Next, I need to evaluate the choices:
a) This describes interviewer bias, not sampling error.
b) This correctly describes sampling error, as it arises when a sample statistic is used to estimate a population parameter.
c) This describes judgment sampling, which is a type of non-random sampling, not sampling error.
d) While small samples can increase sampling error, this is not the definition of sampling error itself.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. The R-squared value (R-sq) is 98.1%. This indicates that 98.1% of the variation in the response variable is explained by the regression model. This directly supports statement III.

2. R-squared does not indicate the direction (positive or negative) of the relationship between the explanatory and response variables. It only measures the strength of the relationship. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the relationship is positive (I) or negative (II) based solely on the R-squared value.

3. Since we cannot confirm both I and II simultaneously, the correct interpretation is that either I or II (but not both) could be true, along with III.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Understand the concept of single-blind and double-blind experiments**: 
   - A single-blind experiment is when the participants do not know which treatment they are receiving, but the researchers do.
   - A double-blind experiment is when neither the participants nor the researchers know which treatment the participants are receiving.

2. **Analyze the setup of the experiment**:
   - In this case, patients are assigned to two groups: one receiving medication and the other receiving blindfolds and soft music. 
   - Patients will likely know which treatment they are receiving (e.g., they will know if they are taking medication or wearing a blindfold and listening to music). This means the experiment cannot be double-blind because the participants are aware of their treatment.

3. **Evaluate the choices**:
   - a) Incorrect: It is possible for experiments involving human subjects to be single-blind or double-blind, depending on the design.
   - b) Incorrect: The presence or absence of a control group does not determine whether an experiment is single-blind or double-blind.
   - c) Correct: This is a single-blind experiment because the patients know which treatment they are receiving, but the examining doctor might not know.
   - d) Incorrect: This is not a double-blind experiment because the patients are aware of their treatment.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall the definition of a P-value. The P-value represents the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme as the observed result, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

Next, I need to analyze the given P-value of 0.07. This means there is a 7% probability of observing a difference as large as or larger than the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis (that the new keyboard is no better than the traditional one) is true.

Finally, I need to match this interpretation with the choices provided. The correct interpretation is that there is a 7% chance of getting a difference between the two groups at least as large as the observed difference if the null hypothesis is true.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will consider the necessary assumptions for conducting a t-test:

1. A t-test assumes that the data in each group is sampled from a population that is normally distributed. This is particularly important when the sample size is small, as in this case (n=5 for each group).

2. Another assumption for a t-test is that the variances of the two groups are equal (homogeneity of variances). This is specifically required for a two-sample t-test.

3. The population variances being known or unknown is not a necessary assumption for conducting a t-test. Instead, the test is designed to work with sample data to estimate population parameters.

Based on these considerations, the most necessary assumption for this scenario is that the population of SAT scores from each group is normally distributed.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will first determine whether the events E and F are independent. Events E and F are independent if and only if P(E ∩ F) = P(E) * P(F).  
Step 1: Calculate P(E) * P(F). P(E) * P(F) = 0.32 * 0.15 = 0.048.  
Step 2: Compare P(E ∩ F) with P(E) * P(F). Since P(E ∩ F) = 0.048, which equals P(E) * P(F), the events E and F are independent.  

Next, I will determine whether the events E and F are mutually exclusive. Events E and F are mutually exclusive if and only if P(E ∩ F) = 0.  
Step 3: Check P(E ∩ F). Since P(E ∩ F) = 0.048, which is not equal to 0, the events E and F are not mutually exclusive.  

Conclusion: The events E and F are independent but not mutually exclusive.  
The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The research team is testing the effect of an experimental cancer drug on tumor reduction. Tumor reduction is the outcome being measured, so it is the **response variable**.
2. The drug is administered at three different dosages. These dosages represent different levels of the **explanatory variable**, which is the dosage of the drug.
3. Since there is only one explanatory variable (the drug dosage) with three levels (the three dosages), the correct description is that there are three levels of a single explanatory variable.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct pair of hypotheses, we need to consider the claim being tested. The department store claims that over 60 percent of the mall's visitors shop at the store. This means the alternative hypothesis (Ha) should reflect that the proportion (p) is greater than 0.60. The null hypothesis (H0) is the opposite of the alternative hypothesis, which would state that the proportion is less than or equal to 0.60.

Step 1: Identify the claim. The claim is that the proportion of mall visitors who shop at the store is greater than 0.60.

Step 2: Formulate the null hypothesis (H0). The null hypothesis represents the status quo or the opposite of the claim, so H0: p ≤ 0.60.

Step 3: Formulate the alternative hypothesis (Ha). The alternative hypothesis represents the claim, so Ha: p > 0.60.

Thus, the correct pair of hypotheses is H0: p ≤ 0.60 and Ha: p > 0.60.

"To determine which of the options can affect the value of the correlation coefficient \( r \), let's analyze each choice step by step:

1. **Option a: A change in measurement units**  
   The correlation coefficient \( r \) is a standardized measure of the linear relationship between two variables. Changing the measurement units (e.g., converting from inches to centimeters) does not affect the value of \( r \) because it is unitless. Therefore, this option does not affect \( r \).

2. **Option b: A change in which variable is called \( x \) and which is called \( y \)**  
   The correlation coefficient \( r \) is symmetric, meaning it does not depend on which variable is designated as \( x \) or \( y \). Swapping \( x \) and \( y \) does not change the value of \( r \). Thus, this option does not affect \( r \).

3. **Option c: Adding the same constant to all values of the \( x \)-variable**  
   Adding a constant to all values of \( x \) shifts the data horizontally but does not change the relative positions of the points or the strength of the linear relationship. Therefore, this does not affect \( r \).

4. **Option d: None of the above can affect the \( r \) value**  
   Since none of the previous options (a, b, or c) affect the value of \( r \), this option is correct.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's think step by step:

1. The size of a confidence interval is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size. This means that if the sample size increases, the confidence interval size decreases, and vice versa.

2. If the sample size is tripled, the new sample size becomes 3 times the original. The square root of 3 is approximately 1.732.

3. Since the confidence interval size is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size, tripling the sample size will divide the confidence interval size by 1.732.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the properties of the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient \( r \) is unaffected by adding a constant to all values of one variable or by multiplying all values of one variable by a positive constant. 

Next, adding 0.23 to all values of the x-variable does not change the correlation. Similarly, doubling all values of the y-variable also does not change the correlation because the scaling factor is positive.

Finally, interchanging the two variables does not affect the magnitude or sign of the correlation coefficient. Therefore, the correlation remains the same.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand that a standardized score (z-score) is calculated as \( z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \), where \( x \) is the raw score, \( \mu \) is the mean, and \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation. 

Next, converting the times from seconds to minutes involves dividing all values (including the mean and standard deviation) by 60. However, since both the mean and standard deviation are scaled by the same factor, the relative position of the raw score \( x \) to the mean \( \mu \) in terms of standard deviations does not change.

Therefore, the z-score remains the same regardless of the unit conversion.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the experiment step by step:

1. The experiment involves testing the effects of three different types of paint on the durability of wooden toys. This indicates that ""type of paint"" is one factor being studied.

2. The children are divided into two groups based on sex (boys and girls). This division is done because boys and girls may play differently with toys, which could influence the results. This suggests that ""sex"" is a blocking factor, as it is used to control for variability in the experiment.

3. A blocking factor is a variable that is not of primary interest but is controlled for to reduce variability in the results. In this case, ""sex"" is the blocking factor, not ""type of paint.""

4. Since the experiment is not completely randomized (children are grouped by sex), this is not a completely randomized design.

5. There are three types of paint and two sex groups, which could lead to six treatment combinations. However, the question does not explicitly state that all combinations are tested, so this cannot be definitively concluded.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I need to analyze the meaning of the correlation coefficient \( r \) and its implications:

1. The correlation coefficient \( r = 0.9 \) indicates a strong positive linear relationship between the number of hours students study and their GPAs. However, it does not directly imply percentages of students or grades, so options (a) and (b) are incorrect.

2. The coefficient of determination \( r^2 \) is used to explain the proportion of variation in one variable that can be explained by the variation in another variable. Here, \( r^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81 \), or 81%. This means 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by the variation in study hours.

3. Therefore, the correct conclusion is option (d): 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in the number of study hours per day.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the z-score for Estrella's score**: The z-score is calculated using the formula \( z = \frac{(X - \mu)}{\sigma} \), where \( X \) is the score, \( \mu \) is the mean, and \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation. Substituting the values \( X = 90 \), \( \mu = 80 \), and \( \sigma = 9 \), we get \( z = \frac{(90 - 80)}{9} = \frac{10}{9} \approx 1.11 \).

2. **Find the percentile rank corresponding to the z-score**: Using a z-table or standard normal distribution calculator, a z-score of approximately 1.11 corresponds to a cumulative probability of about 0.8665, or 86.65%. This means Estrella scored better than 86.65% of the test-takers.

3. **Determine if she qualifies for further evaluation**: To qualify, Estrella needs to be in the top 15%, which corresponds to a cumulative probability of 85% or higher. Since her percentile rank is 86.65%, she qualifies for further evaluation.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine whether this study is an experiment or an observational study, I need to analyze the setup step by step:

1. In an experiment, researchers actively assign participants to different groups or treatments, while in an observational study, researchers simply observe and collect data without intervention.
2. In this case, the researchers are actively assigning half of the volunteers to exercise and the other half to not exercise. This indicates that it is an experiment.
3. The study involves a control group (the group instructed to perform no exercise) and a treatment group (the group exercising 1 hour each morning). However, there is no mention of blinding or blocking in the description.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. The confidence interval (18, 41) represents the range of the difference in mean cholesterol level lowering between Lipitor and niacin. This means that, with 95% confidence, Lipitor lowers cholesterol levels by 18 to 41 points more than niacin on average.

2. Option a is incorrect because the confidence interval does not provide the individual cholesterol-lowering effects of niacin or Lipitor. It only provides the difference in their effects.

3. Option b is incorrect because the confidence interval does not apply to individual outcomes. It applies to the difference in mean effects between the two treatments.

4. Option c is incorrect because the confidence interval does not guarantee a specific difference (e.g., at least 23 points) for any given individual. It only provides a range for the average difference.

5. Therefore, the correct answer is d) None of the above.

"To solve this, let's analyze the statements step by step:

1. **Understanding the confidence interval**: A 95% confidence interval means that if we were to take many random samples of the same size and compute a confidence interval for each sample, approximately 95% of those intervals would contain the true population mean. This is the definition of a confidence interval.

2. **Analyzing the choices**:
   - **Choice a**: This is correct because it aligns with the definition of a confidence interval. In repeated sampling, 95% of the intervals will contain the true mean weight of the oranges.
   - **Choice b**: This is incorrect because the confidence interval is about the population mean, not the sampled mean. The sampled mean is always within the interval since the interval is constructed around it.
   - **Choice c**: This is incorrect because the confidence interval does not describe the distribution of individual sample weights. It estimates the range for the population mean.
   - **Choice d**: This is incorrect because the confidence interval does not describe the range of weights for all oranges of this variety. It only estimates the population mean.

3. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the correct answer is choice a.

"To solve this, I will analyze the probabilities for each game based on the number of coin flips.

1. **First game (45%-55% heads):**  
   - If you flip the coin 30 times, 45%-55% corresponds to getting between 13.5 and 16.5 heads (inclusive). Since the number of heads must be an integer, this means you win if you get 14, 15, or 16 heads. The probability of this happening is relatively higher with fewer flips because the distribution of heads is more spread out.  
   - If you flip the coin 300 times, 45%-55% corresponds to getting between 135 and 165 heads. With more flips, the distribution of heads becomes narrower (closer to 50%), so the probability of staying within this range is higher.  

2. **Second game (more than 80% heads):**  
   - If you flip the coin 30 times, 80% corresponds to getting more than 24 heads. The probability of this happening is very low because the expected number of heads is 15 (50% of 30), and getting more than 24 heads is far from the mean.  
   - If you flip the coin 300 times, 80% corresponds to getting more than 240 heads. The probability of this happening is even lower because the expected number of heads is 150 (50% of 300), and getting more than 240 heads is extremely unlikely due to the law of large numbers.  

3. **Conclusion:**  
   - For the first game, flipping the coin 300 times gives a better chance of staying within the 45%-55% range.  
   - For the second game, flipping the coin 30 times gives a better chance of exceeding 80% heads because the distribution is wider with fewer flips.  

Thus, the best choice is to flip **300 times for the first game** and **30 times for the second game**.

"To determine the correct assumption for the validity of the t-test, I will analyze the options step by step:

1. A t-test assumes that the data comes from populations that are normally distributed, especially when the sample size is small (like in this case, with 10 salespeople per location). This is a key assumption for the validity of the t-test.
2. The assumption about the equality of population standard deviations (homogeneity of variances) is relevant for a specific type of t-test (pooled t-test), but it is not a general requirement for all t-tests. Therefore, this is not the most necessary assumption here.
3. Knowing the population standard deviations is not required for a t-test. Instead, the sample standard deviations are used to estimate the population standard deviations.
4. The most critical assumption for the validity of the t-test in this scenario is that the population of sales records at each location is normally distributed, given the small sample size.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the Type I error probability for a single test**: The probability of committing a Type I error for a single test is equal to the significance level, which is α = 0.05.

2. **Calculate the probability of not committing a Type I error for a single test**: This is 1 - α = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.

3. **Calculate the probability of not committing a Type I error across all 10 tests**: Since the tests are independent, the probability of not committing a Type I error in all 10 tests is \( 0.95^{10} \).

4. **Calculate the probability of committing at least one Type I error**: The complement of not committing a Type I error in all 10 tests is the probability of committing at least one Type I error. This is \( 1 - 0.95^{10} \).

5. **Perform the calculation**: 
   - \( 0.95^{10} \approx 0.5987 \).
   - \( 1 - 0.5987 = 0.4013 \).

Thus, the probability of committing a Type I error with at least one of the 10 tests is approximately 0.40.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I need to use the properties of the normal distribution and the given probabilities.

1. First, I note that 60% of the parts last over 3 years. This means that 40% of the parts last less than 3 years. Using the z-table, I find the z-value corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.40. The z-value is approximately -0.25.

2. Next, I note that 70% of the parts last less than 6 years. Using the z-table, I find the z-value corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.70. The z-value is approximately 0.52.

3. Using the z-scores and the formula \( z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \), I set up two equations:
   - For 3 years: \( -0.25 = \frac{3 - \mu}{\sigma} \)
   - For 6 years: \( 0.52 = \frac{6 - \mu}{\sigma} \)

4. Solving these two equations simultaneously, I calculate the mean (\( \mu \)) and standard deviation (\( \sigma \)).

After solving, the correct values are \( \mu = 4.177 \) and \( \sigma = 3.561 \).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the proper alternative hypothesis (HA), we need to consider the psychologist's belief. The psychologist believes that positive rewards are more effective than punishment, meaning the ""proper behavior"" rating for children receiving positive rewards (μ1) is greater than that for children receiving punishment (μ2). 

Step 1: The null hypothesis (H0) states that there is no difference between the two groups, i.e., μ1 − μ2 = 0.  
Step 2: The alternative hypothesis (HA) should reflect the psychologist's belief that μ1 is greater than μ2, which translates to μ1 − μ2 > 0.  
Step 3: Based on this reasoning, the correct statement of HA is μ1 − μ2 > 0.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **A smaller confidence level (I):** A smaller confidence level reduces the critical value (z or t), which directly decreases the margin of error. So, this will result in a smaller margin of error.

2. **A smaller sample standard deviation (II):** The margin of error is proportional to the sample standard deviation. If the sample standard deviation decreases, the margin of error also decreases. So, this will result in a smaller margin of error.

3. **A smaller sample size (III):** The margin of error is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size. A smaller sample size increases the margin of error, not decreases it. So, this will not result in a smaller margin of error.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the importance of each option in the design of experiments.  
1. Control of confounding variables is crucial to ensure that the results are not influenced by external factors.  
2. Randomization is important to eliminate bias and ensure that subjects are assigned to treatments fairly.  
3. Using a confounding variable to control the placebo effect is incorrect because confounding variables should be controlled or eliminated, not used as a tool.  
4. Replication is essential to ensure the reliability and validity of the experiment's results.  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement a**: ""The probability of a Type II error does not depend on the probability of a Type I error.""  
   This is incorrect. The probabilities of Type I and Type II errors are inversely related. If you decrease the probability of a Type I error (α), the probability of a Type II error (β) generally increases, and vice versa.

2. **Statement b**: ""In conducting a hypothesis test, it is possible to simultaneously make both a Type I and a Type II error.""  
   This is incorrect. A Type I error occurs when you reject a true null hypothesis, while a Type II error occurs when you fail to reject a false null hypothesis. These two errors are mutually exclusive and cannot occur simultaneously.

3. **Statement c**: ""A Type II error will result if one incorrectly assumes the data are normally distributed.""  
   This is incorrect. A Type II error occurs when you fail to reject a false null hypothesis. While incorrect assumptions about data distribution can affect the validity of a test, they do not directly define a Type II error.

4. **Statement d**: ""When you choose a significance level α, you're setting the probability of a Type I error to exactly α.""  
   This is correct. The significance level (α) is the threshold for the probability of making a Type I error, which is rejecting a true null hypothesis. By choosing α, you are explicitly setting the probability of a Type I error.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this:

1. The 60th and 40th percentiles represent values in the distribution of scores that divide the population into specific proportions. The difference between these percentiles measures the spread or range of scores between these two points.

2. This difference does not provide information about the central tendency (e.g., mean, median, or mode), as it focuses on the spread rather than the center of the data.

3. The measurement also does not directly address symmetry or skewness, as it does not involve comparing the shape of the distribution or the tails.

4. Instead, this measurement provides information about **variability**, as it quantifies the spread of scores between the 40th and 60th percentiles.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall the characteristics of a binomial setting. In a binomial setting, there are four key conditions: (1) there is a fixed number of trials, (2) each trial is independent, (3) each trial results in either a success or a failure, and (4) the probability of success is the same for each trial.

Next, I analyze the options:
- Option a) aligns with the binomial setting because each trial must result in either a success or a failure.
- Option b) aligns with the binomial setting because trials must be independent.
- Option d) aligns with the binomial setting because there must be a fixed number of trials.
- Option c) does not align with the binomial setting because it describes a geometric setting, where the random variable is the number of trials until the first success.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I need to calculate the standard deviation of the total weight of the packed boxes, which includes the weight of the books, the box itself, and the packing material. Since these components are independent, their variances can be added.

1. First, I calculate the variance for each component:
   - Variance of the books = (standard deviation of books)^2 = 2^2 = 4.
   - Variance of the box = (standard deviation of the box)^2 = 0.15^2 = 0.0225.
   - Variance of the packing material = (standard deviation of packing material)^2 = 0.25^2 = 0.0625.

2. Next, I add the variances to find the total variance:
   Total variance = 4 + 0.0225 + 0.0625 = 4.085.

3. Finally, I take the square root of the total variance to find the standard deviation:
   Standard deviation = √4.085 ≈ 2.021 pounds.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will consider the relationship between sample size and the spread of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion.

1. The standard error (spread) of the sample proportion is given by the formula:  
   SE = √[p(1-p)/n], where p is the population proportion and n is the sample size.

2. When the sample size increases, the denominator (n) in the formula increases, which causes the standard error (SE) to decrease. This means the distribution of the sample proportion becomes less spread out.

3. Therefore, increasing the sample size from 200 to 2,000 will result in a narrower (less spread out) distribution of the sample proportion.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the confidence interval for the proportion of undecided voters. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Calculate the sample proportion (p):**  
   The proportion of undecided voters in the sample is given by:  
   \( p = \frac{\text{Number of undecided voters}}{\text{Total sample size}} = \frac{256}{400} = 0.64 \).

2. **Determine the standard error (SE):**  
   The standard error for a proportion is calculated as:  
   \( SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \), where \( n \) is the sample size.  
   Substituting the values:  
   \( SE = \sqrt{\frac{0.64(1-0.64)}{400}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.64 \cdot 0.36}{400}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.2304}{400}} = \sqrt{0.000576} = 0.024 \).

3. **Calculate the margin of error (ME):**  
   For a 95% confidence level, the critical z-value is approximately 1.96. The margin of error is given by:  
   \( ME = z \cdot SE = 1.96 \cdot 0.024 = 0.04704 \approx 0.048 \).

4. **Construct the confidence interval:**  
   The confidence interval is:  
   \( p \pm ME = 0.64 \pm 0.048 \).  
   This gives a range of \( 0.592 \) to \( 0.688 \), or approximately 59.2% to 68.8%.

5. **Interpret the result:**  
   The question asks how sure we can be that between 60% and 68% of the electorate were undecided. The interval 59.2% to 68.8% includes the range 60% to 68%, so we can be 95% confident. The closest answer to this confidence level is **90.4%**.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand that the total combined weight of four players, W, is the sum of the weights of the four players. Since the weights of the players are independent, the variance of W is the sum of the variances of the individual weights.

Next, the variance of the weight of one player is the square of the standard deviation, which is \( 47^2 = 2209 \). For four players, the variance of W is \( 4 \times 2209 = 8836 \).

Finally, the standard deviation of W is the square root of the variance, which is \( \sqrt{8836} = 94 \) pounds.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The P-value is a measure used in hypothesis testing to determine the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. It represents the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme as the observed one, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

2. The correct interpretation of a P-value of 0.20 is that there is a 20% probability of observing a result as extreme as the one obtained (or more extreme) purely by chance, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.

3. Among the given choices, the one that aligns with this interpretation is: ""The probability of getting a finding at least as extreme as that obtained by chance alone if the null hypothesis is true is 0.20.""

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: The categories in a contingency table for chi-square tests are indeed not numerical for either variable. This is true because chi-square tests are used for categorical data.

2. **Option b**: Observed frequencies in a contingency table are counts of occurrences, which are whole numbers. This is also true.

3. **Option c**: Expected frequencies are calculated values based on the observed data and the assumption of independence. These values are not required to be whole numbers; they can be decimals. This statement is not true.

4. **Option d**: Expected frequencies in each cell should be at least 5 to ensure the validity of the chi-square test. If this condition is not met, categories may be combined. This is true.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I need to interpret the meaning of a z-score. 

1. A z-score represents how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. A negative z-score indicates the data point is below the mean.
2. In this case, the z-score is –2, which means the runner's time this week is 2 standard deviations below his average time.
3. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that this week his time was two standard deviations lower than his average time.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

1. **Standardize the scores**: Convert the raw scores (700 and 740) into z-scores using the formula \( z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \), where \( x \) is the raw score, \( \mu \) is the mean, and \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation.

   - For 700: \( z = \frac{700 - 650}{45} = \frac{50}{45} \approx 1.11 \).
   - For 740: \( z = \frac{740 - 650}{45} = \frac{90}{45} = 2.00 \).

2. **Find the cumulative probabilities**: Use the standard normal distribution table to find the cumulative probabilities corresponding to these z-scores.
   - For \( z = 1.11 \), the cumulative probability is approximately 0.8665.
   - For \( z = 2.00 \), the cumulative probability is approximately 0.9772.

3. **Calculate the percentage of applicants considered with scores below 740**: Since only applicants with scores above 700 are considered, we need the proportion of scores between 700 and 740. This is given by the difference in cumulative probabilities:
   \[
   P(700 < x < 740) = P(z = 2.00) - P(z = 1.11) = 0.9772 - 0.8665 = 0.1107.
   \]
   Convert this to a percentage: \( 0.1107 \times 100 \approx 11.07\% \).

   However, the question asks for the percentage of applicants considered (above 700) who have scores below 740. To find this, divide the proportion of scores between 700 and 740 by the total proportion of scores above 700:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \frac{P(700 < x < 740)}{P(x > 700)} = \frac{0.1107}{1 - 0.8665} = \frac{0.1107}{0.1335} \approx 0.829 \text{ or } 82.9\%.
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. Percentiles indicate the percentage of people who scored below a certain score. Mary scored at the 64th percentile, meaning 64% of test-takers scored below her. Pam scored at the 56th percentile, meaning 56% of test-takers scored below her.

2. The difference between their percentiles is 64% - 56% = 8%. This means 8% of the test-takers scored between Pam and Mary.

3. The other options (a, b, and d) are not supported by the information provided. Percentiles do not directly indicate the number of points scored or the percentage difference in scores. Additionally, option d does not provide enough context about the total number of test-takers to determine how many scored higher than both Mary and Pam.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which statement should not be made, I will analyze each option step by step:

1. Statement a) suggests that people who drink green tea may have healthier lifestyles, which could explain the observed association. This is a reasonable hypothesis and aligns with the limitations of observational studies.
2. Statement b) suggests that people who drink green tea may have a more positive outlook on life, which could also explain the association. This is another plausible explanation and is consistent with the nature of observational data.
3. Statement c) correctly points out that observational data cannot establish causation, only correlation. This is a valid and important statement to make in the context of the study.
4. Statement d) suggests that people should drink green tea to avoid depression. This implies a causal relationship, which is not supported by the observational nature of the study. Therefore, this statement should not be made.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct conclusion, let's analyze the sampling method step by step:

1. The researcher is obtaining a random sample of principals from each of the 125 school districts. This means the population is divided into groups (school districts), and a random sample is taken from each group.
2. This method is not a simple random sample because the sampling is done within predefined groups (districts) rather than from the entire population as a whole.
3. This is not a cluster sample because in cluster sampling, entire groups (clusters) are randomly selected, and all members of the selected clusters are included in the sample. Here, random sampling is done within each group.
4. This is not systematic sampling because systematic sampling involves selecting every nth individual from a list, which is not the case here.
5. This is a stratified sample because the population is divided into strata (school districts), and random samples are taken from each stratum. Stratified sampling is often used to ensure representation from each subgroup and can provide comparative information.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The control group in an experiment is used as a baseline to compare the effects of the treatment given to the experimental group. It should not receive the treatment under examination but should otherwise experience conditions as similar as possible to the experimental group.

2. Option a) suggests the control group should receive the opposite treatment. This is incorrect because the control group should not receive any treatment related to the experiment.

3. Option b) suggests the control group receives the same treatment as the experimental group but without knowing it. This is incorrect because the control group should not receive the treatment under examination.

4. Option c) suggests the control group undergoes a procedure identical to the experimental group except for receiving the treatment under examination. This is correct because it ensures that any differences observed between the groups can be attributed to the treatment.

5. Option d) suggests the control group undergoes a procedure identical to the experimental group except for a random decision on receiving the treatment. This is incorrect because the control group should not receive the treatment at all.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Understanding the relationship between sample size and confidence intervals**: The width of a confidence interval is inversely related to the square root of the sample size. This means that as the sample size increases, the confidence interval becomes narrower, providing a more precise estimate of the population parameter.

2. **Comparing the two sample sizes**: Tina initially planned to use 15 observations, but her teacher asked her to use 35 observations. By increasing the sample size from 15 to 35, the standard error of the mean decreases, which leads to a narrower confidence interval.

3. **Evaluating the options**: 
   - Option a) is incorrect because increasing the sample size does provide an advantage by narrowing the confidence interval, even if the mean and standard deviation remain approximately the same.
   - Option b) is incorrect because increasing the sample size does not increase the likelihood of error; it reduces variability in the estimate.
   - Option c) is incorrect because increasing the sample size results in a narrower confidence interval, not a wider one.
   - Option d) is correct because increasing the sample size from 15 to 35 results in a narrower confidence interval, which is advantageous.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, the Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal if the sample size is sufficiently large, regardless of the population's shape. Here, the sample size is 16, which is generally considered large enough for the theorem to apply.

Next, the mean of the sampling distribution of the sample means is the same as the population mean, which is 210 mg/dL.

Finally, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample means is the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. This is calculated as \( \frac{15}{\sqrt{16}} = 3.75 \).

Therefore, the correct description is that the shape is approximately normal with a mean of 210 and a standard deviation of 3.75.

"To solve this, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: Changing from equal size treatment groups to very different size treatment groups would generally decrease the power of the test. Equal group sizes maximize the power of a two-sample t-test because they minimize the standard error of the difference between means. Therefore, this statement is false.

2. **Option b**: Changing from a 5% significance level to a 1% significance level would decrease the power of the test. A lower significance level makes it harder to reject the null hypothesis, which reduces the power of the test. Therefore, this statement is false.

3. **Option c**: Taking more careful measurements to reduce variability in the response would decrease the standard deviation of the data. A lower standard deviation increases the test statistic, which increases the power of the test. Therefore, this statement is true.

4. **Option d**: Increasing the sample size reduces the standard error, which increases the power of the test. However, the probability of a Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis) is determined by the significance level (e.g., 5%) and does not depend on the sample size. Therefore, this statement is false.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Understand the hypotheses and errors**:  
   - The null hypothesis \( H_0 \): The mean diameter of the ball bearings is \( \mu = 1.25 \) cm (the machinery is functioning correctly).  
   - The alternative hypothesis \( H_a \): The mean diameter is \( \mu \neq 1.25 \) cm (the machinery is not functioning correctly).  
   - A Type II error occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis \( H_0 \) even though it is false. This means the machinery is producing ball bearings with an incorrect mean diameter, but we do not stop production.

2. **Implications of a Type II error**:  
   If a Type II error occurs, the machinery continues to produce ball bearings even though their mean diameter is incorrect. This results in the continued production of ball bearings that do not meet the required specifications.

3. **Match the scenario to the choices**:  
   - (a) A warranted halt in production to adjust the machinery: This would occur if the null hypothesis is correctly rejected, not a Type II error.  
   - (b) An unnecessary stoppage of the production process: This would occur in a Type I error, where the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected.  
   - (c) Continued production of wrong size ball bearings: This matches the definition of a Type II error, as the machinery is not stopped despite producing incorrect ball bearings.  
   - (d) Continued production of proper size ball bearings: This would occur if the null hypothesis is true and not rejected, which is not a Type II error.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the midpoint of the confidence interval, we need to calculate the sample proportion \( \hat{p} \), which is the proportion of unemployed people in the sample.

1. The sample proportion \( \hat{p} \) is calculated as the number of unemployed people divided by the total sample size. Here, 8% of 500 people are unemployed, so \( \hat{p} = 0.08 \).

2. The midpoint of the confidence interval is simply the sample proportion \( \hat{p} \), as it represents the best estimate of the population proportion \( p \).

3. Therefore, the midpoint for the 95% confidence interval is \( \hat{p} = 0.08 \).

Since none of the provided choices match this value, the correct answer is:

"First, I need to evaluate each option to determine its validity.

Option a) suggests using systematic sampling on a list of AAA members. However, this may not be representative of all drivers in the city, as AAA members might differ systematically from non-members (e.g., they might be more cautious drivers). Thus, this option is not a true statement.

Option b) suggests randomly choosing families and including all drivers in each family. This introduces a cluster sampling method, but it may not be representative of the entire population of drivers, as families might have similar driving behaviors. Thus, this option is also not a true statement.

Option c) claims that randomness is not important as long as the sample size is large. This is incorrect because randomness is crucial to ensure that the sample is representative of the population. A large sample size alone does not guarantee representativeness if the sample is biased. Thus, this option is not a true statement.

Finally, option d) states that none of the above are true statements. Since all the previous options are incorrect, this is the correct answer.

- Option a) describes the relationship between the sample means and the population mean, but it does not fully capture the essence of the central limit theorem.
- Option b) discusses the standard deviation of the sample means, which is related to the standard error, but it is not the central limit theorem itself.
- Option c) correctly states that as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution, which aligns with the central limit theorem.

2. To find the correlation coefficient (R), I need to take the square root of R². The square root of 0.71 is approximately 0.84.

1. In this case, the sampling method involves dividing the employees into five groups (plants) and selecting six employees randomly from each plant. This is an example of stratified sampling, where the population is divided into strata (plants), and a random sample is taken from each stratum.

2. While every employee has an equal chance of being selected within their plant, the method does not allow for every possible group of 30 employees from the entire population to be selected. For example, a group of 30 employees that includes 10 employees from one plant and 20 from another cannot be selected under this method.

3. Therefore, this method does not meet the criteria for a simple random sample, as not every group of 30 employees has the same chance of being selected.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct analysis, I need to consider the type of data and the comparison being made. 

First, the doctor is comparing the mean recovery times between two groups: one group receiving the standard technique and the other receiving the new technique. This indicates that the analysis involves comparing two means.

Second, since the problem does not mention population standard deviations being known, a t-test is appropriate rather than a z-test.

Finally, because the goal is to compare the means of two independent groups, the correct analysis is a t-test for a difference in means.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the sampling method. Although the researcher claims to use a simple random sample, the sample is taken only from adults leaving a Wall Street office building, which is not representative of the entire adult population in the U.S. This introduces selection bias.

Next, I need to consider the response rate. While a high response rate is generally good, it does not compensate for the selection bias caused by the non-representative sampling method.

Finally, I need to assess whether this is a voluntary response study. Since the participants were approached directly and asked to participate, this is not a voluntary response study in the traditional sense (where individuals self-select to participate).

Therefore, the correct conclusion is that selection bias makes this a poorly designed survey. The answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the best control group for this study, I need to consider the purpose of a control group. A control group is used to provide a baseline for comparison, isolating the effect of the experimental treatments. 

1. The study is comparing the effects of classical music and light rock music on piecework output. To isolate the effect of music itself, a control group should ideally experience no music at all. This would allow researchers to compare the output of workers exposed to music with those not exposed to music.

2. Option (a) suggests a group with no music, which would serve as a baseline to measure the effect of any music on output. This is a strong candidate for a control group.

3. Options (b), (c), and (d) involve introducing other types of music or varying music exposure, which would not provide a true baseline for comparison. These groups would introduce additional variables, making it harder to isolate the effect of the experimental treatments.

Therefore, the best control group is the one with no music played. The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this problem, I will use the binomial probability formula, which is \( P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \), where \( n \) is the number of trials, \( k \) is the number of successes, and \( p \) is the probability of success.

1. First, calculate the probability of a cyclone becoming a hurricane. This is given by \( p = \frac{5.1}{8.7} \approx 0.586 \).

2. Next, we are asked to find the probability that at least three out of five cyclones become hurricanes. This means we need to calculate \( P(X \geq 3) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) \).

3. Using the binomial formula:
   - For \( P(X = 3) \): \( \binom{5}{3} (0.586)^3 (1-0.586)^2 \)
   - For \( P(X = 4) \): \( \binom{5}{4} (0.586)^4 (1-0.586)^1 \)
   - For \( P(X = 5) \): \( \binom{5}{5} (0.586)^5 (1-0.586)^0 \)

4. Compute each term and sum them to find \( P(X \geq 3) \).

After performing the calculations, the probability that at least three cyclones become hurricanes is approximately 0.345.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the degrees of freedom for a chi-squared test of independence, the formula is:

Degrees of freedom = (number of rows - 1) × (number of columns - 1).

Step 1: Identify the number of rows and columns in the contingency table. The table is 3 × 4, so there are 3 rows and 4 columns.

Step 2: Subtract 1 from the number of rows and columns. This gives (3 - 1) = 2 and (4 - 1) = 3.

Step 3: Multiply the results from Step 2. The degrees of freedom are 2 × 3 = 6.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, I need to determine the interval that contains the middle 80% of the data in a normal distribution.

1. The middle 80% of a normal distribution corresponds to the central region, leaving 10% in the lower tail and 10% in the upper tail. This means the cumulative probabilities for the lower and upper bounds are 10% (0.10) and 90% (0.90), respectively.

2. Using a standard normal distribution table or a z-score calculator, the z-scores corresponding to cumulative probabilities of 0.10 and 0.90 are approximately -1.28 and +1.28, respectively.

3. To find the actual durations, I use the formula:  
   \( X = \mu + z \cdot \sigma \),  
   where \( \mu = 167 \) (mean) and \( \sigma = 76 \) (standard deviation).  
   For the lower bound:  
   \( X = 167 + (-1.28) \cdot 76 = 167 - 97.28 = 70 \) minutes (rounded).  
   For the upper bound:  
   \( X = 167 + (1.28) \cdot 76 = 167 + 97.28 = 264 \) minutes (rounded).

Thus, the interval containing the middle 80% of durations is approximately 70 minutes to 264 minutes. The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the relationship given: Grade = 50.25 + 10.2(h), where h is the number of hours studied. This means for every additional hour of studying, the grade increases by 10.2 points.

Next, I calculate the effect of studying for 2 hours. Since the grade increases by 10.2 points per hour, studying for 2 hours will result in an increase of 10.2 * 2 = 20.4 points.

Finally, I confirm that the grade will go up by 20.4 points if the student studies for 2 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct significance test:

1. The experiment involves comparing the effectiveness of two treatments (old formula vs. new formula) on the same individual, with each side of the face receiving a different treatment. This indicates a paired design.
2. The response variable is the difference in the number of pimples (old formula - new formula) for each individual. Since the differences are calculated for each person, the data is paired.
3. For paired data, the appropriate test to compare the means of the differences is a matched pairs t-test.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the variable that is associated with cholesterol level and could influence the results of the study. The problem states that the company anticipates an association between cholesterol level and the amount of exercise a person gets.

Next, I need to consider the purpose of blocking in a randomized block design. Blocking is used to control for variability in a variable that is associated with the response variable (in this case, cholesterol level) to reduce confounding effects.

Since exercise level is associated with cholesterol level, blocking on exercise level would help control for its effect and improve the accuracy of the comparison between the two drugs.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify the variable that is associated with cholesterol levels and could potentially confound the results of the experiment. The problem states that daily exercise intensity is associated with cholesterol levels, while sleep length is not.

Next, blocking is a technique used to control for the effects of a variable that could influence the outcome. Since exercise intensity is associated with cholesterol levels, it should be used as the blocking variable to ensure that its effect is accounted for in the experiment.

Finally, blocking on exercise intensity will help isolate the effect of the capsule type (fish oil or garlic) on cholesterol levels, which is the primary focus of the experiment.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, I will use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that a dog actually has heartworm given that it tested positive.

1. Define the events:
   - Let H be the event that a dog has heartworm.
   - Let T+ be the event that a dog tests positive for heartworm.
   - P(H) = 0.10 (10% of dogs have heartworm).
   - P(H') = 0.90 (90% of dogs do not have heartworm).
   - P(T+|H) = 0.96 (96% of dogs with heartworm test positive).
   - P(T+|H') = 0.02 (2% of dogs without heartworm test positive).

2. Use Bayes' theorem:
   The probability that a dog actually has heartworm given that it tested positive is:
   \[
   P(H|T+) = \frac{P(T+|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(T+)}
   \]
   where \( P(T+) \) is the total probability of testing positive, calculated as:
   \[
   P(T+) = P(T+|H) \cdot P(H) + P(T+|H') \cdot P(H')
   \]

3. Calculate \( P(T+) \):
   \[
   P(T+) = (0.96 \cdot 0.10) + (0.02 \cdot 0.90) = 0.096 + 0.018 = 0.114
   \]

4. Calculate \( P(H|T+) \):
   \[
   P(H|T+) = \frac{0.96 \cdot 0.10}{0.114} = \frac{0.096}{0.114} \approx 0.8421
   \]

5. Convert to a percentage:
   The probability is approximately 84%.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate the mean and standard deviation of the random variable \( X + Y \) step by step:

1. **Calculate the mean of \( X + Y \):**  
   Since \( X \) and \( Y \) are independent, the mean of \( X + Y \) is the sum of their means:  
   \[
   \mu_{X+Y} = \mu_X + \mu_Y = 32 + 44 = 76
   \]

2. **Calculate the variance of \( X + Y \):**  
   For independent random variables, the variance of \( X + Y \) is the sum of their variances:  
   \[
   \sigma_{X+Y}^2 = \sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2 = 5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169
   \]

3. **Calculate the standard deviation of \( X + Y \):**  
   The standard deviation is the square root of the variance:  
   \[
   \sigma_{X+Y} = \sqrt{169} = 13
   \]

Thus, the mean is \( 76 \) and the standard deviation is \( 13 \). The correct answer is: {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the issue of nonresponse bias, which occurs when a significant portion of the sample does not respond, potentially leading to unrepresentative results. 

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Using only the 48 returned surveys (options a and b) could lead to biased results because the nonrespondents might differ systematically from the respondents. Randomly selecting 27 additional members (option c) would not address the potential bias from the original nonrespondents. 

Finally, the best approach would be to follow up with the nonrespondents (option d) to encourage their participation, as this would help reduce nonresponse bias and improve the representativeness of the sample.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will analyze the given information step by step:

1. The standard deviation measures the spread or variability of the data. A higher standard deviation indicates more variability (heterogeneity), while a lower standard deviation indicates less variability (homogeneity).
2. Mr. Bee's class has a standard deviation of 11.2, which is higher than Mr. Em's class's standard deviation of 5.6. This means that Mr. Bee's class has more variability in their test scores compared to Mr. Em's class.
3. Based on this, the most reasonable conclusion is that Mr. Em's class is more homogeneous (less variable) than Mr. Bee's class.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate the probability that a patient is diagnosed with at least one of the conditions (Condition A or Condition B).

1. First, calculate the probability of being diagnosed with Condition A. This is given as 15%, or 0.15.

2. Next, calculate the probability of being diagnosed with Condition B. This depends on whether the patient is diagnosed with Condition A or not:
   - If the patient is diagnosed with Condition A (probability 0.15), the probability of also being diagnosed with Condition B is 70%, or 0.7. So, the joint probability of being diagnosed with both Condition A and Condition B is \( 0.15 \times 0.7 = 0.105 \).
   - If the patient is not diagnosed with Condition A (probability \( 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \)), the probability of being diagnosed with Condition B is 10%, or 0.1. So, the probability of being diagnosed with only Condition B is \( 0.85 \times 0.1 = 0.085 \).

3. Add the probabilities of being diagnosed with Condition A or Condition B:
   - The total probability of being diagnosed with at least one condition is \( 0.15 + 0.085 = 0.235 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. A simple random sample is defined by the method of selection, where every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected. This aligns with option a).
2. Examination of the outcome is not a defining characteristic of a simple random sample. It refers to analyzing the results after the sample is taken, which is unrelated to the definition of a simple random sample. This eliminates option b).
3. Both of the above (option c) cannot be correct because only the method of selection (option a) is relevant to the definition.
4. How representative the sample is of the population (option d) is a result of the sampling method but not a defining characteristic of a simple random sample.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to determine the nature of the first study. In the first study, the researchers observed the weights of two groups of people based on their self-reported eating habits (meat-eaters vs. vegetarians). There was no intervention or manipulation of the subjects' diets, so this is an observational study.

Next, I need to determine the nature of the second study. In the second study, the researchers assigned one group to eat meat and another group to follow a vegetarian diet for 6 months. This involves intervention and control, making it a controlled experiment.

Therefore, the first study is an observational study, and the second study is a controlled experiment. The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct description of the term, let's analyze each choice step by step:

1. **Option a)** A factor is a response variable.  
   - A factor is an independent variable that is manipulated in an experiment to observe its effect on the response variable. Therefore, this statement is incorrect because a factor is not the same as a response variable.

2. **Option b)** Replication means the experiment should be repeated several times.  
   - Replication in an experiment refers to repeating the experiment multiple times to ensure the results are consistent and reliable. This statement is correct.

3. **Option c)** Levels are the same as treatments.  
   - Levels refer to the different values or categories of a factor, while treatments are specific combinations of factor levels applied to experimental units. These are related but not the same. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.

4. **Option d)** Experimental units are the same as subjects.  
   - Experimental units are the smallest division of the experimental material to which a treatment is applied. Subjects are a type of experimental unit when dealing with human participants, but experimental units can also refer to non-human entities. Therefore, this statement is not universally correct.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this problem, I need to calculate the probability that at least 3 out of 12 jurors are women, given that 30% of the jury pool are women. This involves using the binomial probability formula.

1. **Step 1: Define the problem and parameters.**
   - The number of trials (jurors) is \( n = 12 \).
   - The probability of success (selecting a woman) is \( p = 0.3 \).
   - The requirement is that at least 3 jurors are women, so we need to calculate \( P(X \geq 3) \), where \( X \) is the number of women in the jury.

2. **Step 2: Use the complement rule.**
   - Instead of directly calculating \( P(X \geq 3) \), we use the complement rule: \( P(X \geq 3) = 1 - P(X \leq 2) \).
   - This means we need to calculate \( P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) \) and subtract it from 1.

3. **Step 3: Apply the binomial probability formula.**
   - The binomial probability formula is \( P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \), where \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the number of combinations.
   - Calculate \( P(X = 0) \), \( P(X = 1) \), and \( P(X = 2) \):
     - \( P(X = 0) = \binom{12}{0} (0.3)^0 (0.7)^{12} = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot (0.7)^{12} \approx 0.01384 \).
     - \( P(X = 1) = \binom{12}{1} (0.3)^1 (0.7)^{11} = 12 \cdot 0.3 \cdot (0.7)^{11} \approx 0.07152 \).
     - \( P(X = 2) = \binom{12}{2} (0.3)^2 (0.7)^{10} = 66 \cdot (0.09) \cdot (0.7)^{10} \approx 0.16807 \).

4. **Step 4: Add the probabilities for \( X \leq 2 \).**
   - \( P(X \leq 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) \approx 0.01384 + 0.07152 + 0.16807 = 0.25343 \).

5. **Step 5: Subtract from 1 to find \( P(X \geq 3) \).**
   - \( P(X \geq 3) = 1 - P(X \leq 2) = 1 - 0.25343 = 0.74657 \).

6. **Step 6: Match the closest answer.**
   - The closest answer to 0.74657 is **b) 0.843**.

"To solve this problem, I will calculate the number of workers remaining at the end of the second year step by step.

1. **First group of 100 workers (hired at the start of the first year):**
   - After the first year, 20% of the workers leave, so 80% remain. This means \( 100 \times 0.8 = 80 \) workers remain after the first year.
   - During the second year, 5% of these remaining workers leave. This means \( 80 \times 0.05 = 4 \) workers leave, so \( 80 - 4 = 76 \) workers from the first group are still on the job at the end of the second year.

2. **Second group of 100 workers (hired at the start of the second year):**
   - These workers are only in their first year at the end of the second year. After one year, 20% of them leave, so \( 100 \times 0.8 = 80 \) workers remain.

3. **Total workers remaining at the end of the second year:**
   - Adding the workers remaining from both groups: \( 76 + 80 = 156 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to determine the type of study described. The reporter is examining existing police reports and collecting data about car speed and stopping distance. This means the reporter is not manipulating any variables or conducting an experiment.

Next, I need to consider whether this involves blinding. Blinding typically applies to experiments where participants or researchers are unaware of certain aspects of the study to prevent bias. Since this study involves analyzing existing data, there is no blinding involved.

Finally, I recognize that this is an observational study because the reporter is observing and analyzing data without intervening or influencing the variables.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine if a binomial model is appropriate, we need to check if the situation satisfies the following conditions: 
1. There are a fixed number of trials.
2. Each trial has only two possible outcomes (success or failure).
3. The probability of success is the same for each trial.
4. The trials are independent.

a) The number of heads in three tosses of a coin: This satisfies all the conditions of a binomial model (fixed trials, two outcomes, constant probability, and independence).

b) The number of rainy days in a given week: This may not satisfy the independence condition, as weather on one day can influence the weather on the next day.

c) The number of girls in a family of five children: This satisfies the conditions of a binomial model (fixed trials, two outcomes, constant probability, and independence).

d) The number of students present in a class of 22: This does not satisfy the condition of constant probability, as the probability of a student being present may vary depending on individual circumstances.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze the question and the choices provided. The question is about the effect of wording on responses in a questionnaire, specifically regarding a proposed school budget increase.

Next, I need to identify the most relevant concept. The wording of questions can lead to ""response bias,"" which occurs when the phrasing of a question influences the answers given by respondents.

Finally, I need to match the correct choice with the explanation. The correct choice should explain that the difference in percentages (58% and 13%) is due to response bias caused by the wording of the questions.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate the probability of a fuse lasting at least 1 hour (60 minutes) for each company using the normal distribution.

1. **For Company I**: The mean is 50 minutes, and the standard deviation is 10 minutes. To find the z-score for 60 minutes:
   \[
   z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{60 - 50}{10} = 1
   \]
   Using the z-score table, the probability of a z-score less than 1 is approximately 0.8413. Therefore, the probability of lasting at least 60 minutes is:
   \[
   1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587
   \]

2. **For Company II**: The mean is 55 minutes, and the standard deviation is 5 minutes. To find the z-score for 60 minutes:
   \[
   z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{60 - 55}{5} = 1
   \]
   Similarly, the probability of a z-score less than 1 is approximately 0.8413. Thus, the probability of lasting at least 60 minutes is:
   \[
   1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587
   \]

3. **Conclusion**: For both companies, the probability that a fuse will last at least 1 hour is approximately 0.159.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. The confidence interval is given as -0.197 ± 0.081. This means the interval is from -0.197 - 0.081 = -0.278 to -0.197 + 0.081 = -0.116.
2. The interval does not include zero, which suggests there is a statistically significant difference between the satisfaction proportions of Toyota and Subaru owners.
3. The interval being negative indicates that Subaru owners are more satisfied than Toyota owners, with the difference in satisfaction proportions ranging from -0.278 to -0.116.
4. The proper conclusion is that we are 90% confident that the difference in proportions between Toyota and Subaru car owners who are satisfied with their drive systems is between -0.278 and -0.116.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate each statement to determine its validity.

a) The correlation coefficient and the slope of the regression line always have the same sign, as they both describe the direction of the relationship between the variables. This statement is false.

b) A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect linear relationship, but it does not necessarily imply a cause-and-effect relationship. This statement is false.

c) Correlations of +0.87 and -0.87 indicate the same strength of the linear relationship, as the magnitude of the correlation coefficient reflects the degree of clustering around the regression line, regardless of the sign. This statement is true.

d) Correlation applies only to quantitative data, as it measures the linear relationship between two numerical variables. It does not apply to categorical data. This statement is false.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, a two-proportion z-test requires that the number of successes (opposing the dress code) and the number of failures (not opposing the dress code) in each group be large enough to satisfy the conditions for normal approximation. 

Next, for the males, there are 50 successes (opposing) and 10 failures (not opposing), which satisfies the condition of being large enough. For the females, there are 66 successes (opposing) and 4 failures (not opposing), and 4 is not large enough to meet the condition.

Finally, since the number of failures for females is too small, the conditions for a two-proportion z-test are not met.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this problem, I need to determine the mean setting for the dispenser such that the probability of delivering more than 12 ounces (overflowing the cup) is less than 1%. 

1. First, I recognize that the problem involves a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0.3 ounces. The goal is to find the mean setting, \( \mu \), such that the probability of delivering more than 12 ounces is less than 1%. This corresponds to the upper tail of the normal distribution.

2. Next, I use the z-score formula: \( z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \), where \( x = 12 \) ounces, \( \sigma = 0.3 \) ounces, and \( z \) is the z-score corresponding to the 99th percentile of the normal distribution. From z-tables or standard normal distribution tables, the z-score for the 99th percentile (leaving 1% in the upper tail) is approximately \( z = 2.326 \).

3. Rearranging the z-score formula to solve for \( \mu \), I get:
   \[
   \mu = x - z \cdot \sigma
   \]
   Substituting the values \( x = 12 \), \( z = 2.326 \), and \( \sigma = 0.3 \), I calculate:
   \[
   \mu = 12 - 2.326 \cdot 0.3 = 12 - 0.6978 \approx 11.3022 \, \text{ounces}.
   \]

4. The correct answer corresponds to the choice \( 12 - 2.326(0.3) \).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I will use the properties of the normal distribution and the z-score formula.

1. First, calculate the z-score for 225 calories using the formula:  
   \( z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \),  
   where \( X = 225 \), \( \mu = 210 \), and \( \sigma = 10 \).  
   Substituting the values:  
   \( z = \frac{225 - 210}{10} = \frac{15}{10} = 1.5 \).

2. Next, use the z-score table to find the proportion of the distribution below a z-score of 1.5.  
   From the z-score table, the cumulative probability for \( z = 1.5 \) is approximately 0.9332.  
   This means 93.32% of the candy bars have 225 calories or fewer.

3. To find the percentage of candy bars with more than 225 calories, subtract the cumulative probability from 1:  
   \( 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668 \), or 6.68%.

Thus, the percentage of candy bars with more than 225 calories is 6.68%. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to determine the z-score, which measures how many standard deviations the value of 3,000 loaves is above the mean daily demand of 2,500 loaves. The formula for the z-score is:  
\( z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \),  
where \( X = 3,000 \), \( \mu = 2,500 \), and \( \sigma = 225 \).  
Substituting the values, \( z = \frac{3,000 - 2,500}{225} = \frac{500}{225} \approx 2.22 \).

Next, I use the z-score to find the probability that the demand exceeds 3,000 loaves. From standard normal distribution tables, the cumulative probability for \( z = 2.22 \) is approximately 0.9869. This represents the probability that the demand is less than or equal to 3,000 loaves.

Finally, to find the probability that the bakery will run out of bread (demand exceeds 3,000 loaves), I subtract the cumulative probability from 1:  
\( 1 - 0.9869 = 0.0131 \), which rounds to approximately 0.0132.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to calculate the probability of both dice showing 6. Since each die has 6 faces, the probability of rolling a 6 on one die is 1/6. The probability of both dice showing 6 is (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36.

Next, I calculate the probability of not rolling double 6s. This is the complement of the event of rolling double 6s, so the probability is 1 - 1/36 = 35/36.

Now, I calculate the expected value of the game. If the player wins, they gain $20 but lose the $2 cost to play, so the net gain is $20 - $2 = $18. If the player loses, they lose the $2 cost to play, so the net loss is -$2. The expected value is:
(1/36) * $18 + (35/36) * (-$2) = $0.50 - $1.94 = -$1.44.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. A fair die has six faces, with three even numbers (2, 4, 6) and three odd numbers (1, 3, 5). The probability of rolling an even number on any single toss is 3/6 = 0.5, and this probability does not change regardless of previous outcomes because each toss is independent.

2. The law of large numbers states that as the number of trials increases, the relative frequency of an event will approach its theoretical probability. However, this does not mean that the outcome of a single toss is influenced by previous tosses. Each toss is independent.

3. Conditional probability would only apply if there were some dependency between the tosses, but in this case, the tosses are independent. The outcome of the next toss is not affected by the outcomes of the previous tosses.

4. Dice do not have memories, so the result of the next toss is not influenced by the previous outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number remains 0.5 for each toss.

5. Therefore, the correct statement is that the probability of the next toss being even is 0.5.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the conditional probability \( P(X < 100,000 \mid X > 80,000) \), where \( X \) is the number of miles driven by a randomly selected cab. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Standardize the values**: Convert the given mileages (100,000 and 80,000) into z-scores using the formula \( z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \), where \( \mu = 75,000 \) (mean) and \( \sigma = 12,000 \) (standard deviation).
   - For 100,000 miles: \( z = \frac{100,000 - 75,000}{12,000} = \frac{25,000}{12,000} \approx 2.08 \).
   - For 80,000 miles: \( z = \frac{80,000 - 75,000}{12,000} = \frac{5,000}{12,000} \approx 0.42 \).

2. **Find the cumulative probabilities**: Use the standard normal distribution table to find the cumulative probabilities corresponding to these z-scores.
   - For \( z = 2.08 \), the cumulative probability \( P(Z < 2.08) \approx 0.9812 \).
   - For \( z = 0.42 \), the cumulative probability \( P(Z < 0.42) \approx 0.6628 \).

3. **Calculate the conditional probability**: The conditional probability is given by:
   \[
   P(X < 100,000 \mid X > 80,000) = \frac{P(80,000 < X < 100,000)}{P(X > 80,000)}.
   \]
   - \( P(80,000 < X < 100,000) = P(X < 100,000) - P(X < 80,000) = 0.9812 - 0.6628 = 0.3184 \).
   - \( P(X > 80,000) = 1 - P(X < 80,000) = 1 - 0.6628 = 0.3372 \).
   - Therefore, \( P(X < 100,000 \mid X > 80,000) = \frac{0.3184}{0.3372} \approx 0.94 \).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement a**: The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval constructed.  
   This is not necessarily true. A confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the true proportion, but it does not guarantee that the true proportion is within the interval for any specific sample. The confidence level (95%) refers to the long-term success rate of the method, not a guarantee for a single interval.

2. **Statement b**: Ninety-five percent of students at this university have the correct address on record.  
   This is incorrect. The confidence interval does not provide a direct percentage of students with correct addresses; it provides a range of plausible values for the true proportion based on the sample data.

3. **Statement c**: The true proportion of students at this university with the correct addresses on record is within the confidence interval 95 percent of the time.  
   This is a correct interpretation of the confidence level. If we were to take many random samples and construct confidence intervals for each, 95% of those intervals would contain the true proportion.

4. **Statement d**: The sample proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval.  
   This is incorrect. The sample proportion is used to construct the confidence interval, so it is always at the center of the interval. It is not ""within"" the interval because it defines the interval.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The null hypothesis \( H_0: \mu = 3.5 \) is tested against the alternative hypothesis \( H_a: \mu > 3.5 \). The test results are significant at a 5% level of significance, meaning the null hypothesis is rejected. This implies that the sample data provides strong evidence that the true mean petal length is greater than 3.5 cm.

2. A 90% confidence interval is constructed to estimate the mean petal length. Since the null hypothesis \( H_0: \mu = 3.5 \) was rejected, the value 3.5 cm will not be within the 90% confidence interval. This is because the confidence interval will only include values that are plausible for the true mean, and 3.5 cm is no longer considered plausible based on the test results.

3. The correct interpretation is that the specified mean length of 3.5 cm is not within the 90% confidence interval.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I will break it down step by step:

1. The problem asks for the probability that at least one child out of the five examined will develop a cavity before turning 10. This is equivalent to finding \( P(X \geq 1) \), where \( X \) is the number of children who develop cavities.

2. The complement of \( P(X \geq 1) \) is \( P(X = 0) \), which is the probability that none of the five children develop cavities. Using the complement rule, \( P(X \geq 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) \).

3. Therefore, the correct answer is the expression \( 1 - P(X = 0) \).

The correct choice is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which statement is NOT true about the χ² probability distribution function, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: The area under the χ² curve is 1.  
   - This is true because the χ² distribution is a probability distribution, and the total area under any probability distribution curve must equal 1.

2. **Option b**: χ² is defined only for nonnegative values of the variable.  
   - This is true because the χ² distribution is based on squared values, which are always nonnegative.

3. **Option c**: For small degrees of freedom, the curve displays strong right-skewness.  
   - This is true because the χ² distribution is highly skewed to the right when the degrees of freedom are small. As the degrees of freedom increase, the distribution becomes more symmetric.

4. **Option d**: For the same α, as the number of degrees of freedom increases, the critical value for the rejection region decreases.  
   - This is NOT true. As the degrees of freedom increase, the critical value for the rejection region (e.g., the χ² value corresponding to a given α) actually increases, not decreases. This is because the χ² distribution spreads out as the degrees of freedom increase.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze the given formula: Selling price = 15.9 – 0.983 (age). Here, 15.9 represents the selling price of a new car (in $1,000), and -0.983 represents the decrease in selling price (in $1,000) for every additional year of age.

Next, I need to determine the decrease in selling price for every year the car gets older. Since -0.983 is the coefficient of ""age,"" it means the selling price decreases by $0.983 (in $1,000), which is equivalent to $983.

Finally, I compare this conclusion with the given choices. The correct interpretation is that for every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $983.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the greatest power of the test, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the relationship between power, significance level (α), and sample size (n):**
   - Power increases with a larger significance level (α) because a higher α makes it easier to reject the null hypothesis.
   - Power also increases with a larger sample size (n) because a larger sample size reduces the standard error, making it easier to detect a true difference.

2. **Compare the given choices:**
   - Choice (a): α = 0.05, n = 15 (moderate α, small n).
   - Choice (b): α = 0.01, n = 15 (small α, small n).
   - Choice (c): α = 0.05, n = 30 (moderate α, larger n).
   - Choice (d): α = 0.01, n = 30 (small α, larger n).

3. **Determine the greatest power:**
   - A larger sample size (n = 30) will result in greater power compared to a smaller sample size (n = 15).
   - Between the two larger sample size options (c and d), the one with the higher significance level (α = 0.05) will have greater power because it is less stringent in rejecting the null hypothesis.

Thus, the combination of α = 0.05 and n = 30 (choice c) results in the greatest power of the test.

"To solve this problem:

1. The farmer is conducting a two-tailed t-test at a 5% significance level. For a sample size of 18, the degrees of freedom (df) are 18 - 1 = 17. Using a t-table or calculator, the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with df = 17 and α = 0.05 is approximately ±2.11.

2. The test statistic calculated is t = -1.973. This value is compared to the critical t-values of ±2.11. Since -1.973 is less extreme than -2.11 (it does not fall in the rejection region), the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.

3. Therefore, the farmer does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the group that the survey is targeting. The survey is conducted to assess the support for a gasoline tax increase among county residents.  
Next, I need to determine the population of interest. The population of interest is the group whose opinions the survey aims to represent.  
Since the survey is about all county residents' support for the tax increase, the population of interest is all county residents.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine if this method results in a simple random sample, I need to consider the definition of a simple random sample. A simple random sample means that every individual and every possible group of individuals of the intended size has an equal chance of being selected.

1. The researcher plans to select every twenty-fifth student entering the school. This is a systematic sampling method, not a simple random sampling method.
2. In systematic sampling, not every group of students has an equal chance of being selected. For example, if the first student selected is the 5th student, then the sample will always include the 5th, 30th, 55th, etc., and no other groups of students can be chosen.
3. Therefore, this method does not meet the criteria for a simple random sample.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze each statement to determine its validity.  
a) This is incorrect because a complete census does not inherently establish cause-and-effect relationships; experiments are designed for this purpose.  
b) This is incorrect because observational studies cannot establish cause-and-effect relationships as strongly as experiments due to the lack of control over variables.  
c) This is correct because observational studies often suggest potential relationships, which are then tested through controlled experiments to establish causation.  
d) This is incorrect because increasing the sample size in observational studies does not necessarily overcome bias; bias is related to study design, not sample size.  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I will use the concept of conditional probability.

1. First, I note that 60% of customers request an oil change, 30% request tire replacements, and 10% request both. This means the probability of requesting an oil change is P(O) = 0.6, the probability of requesting tire replacements is P(T) = 0.3, and the probability of requesting both is P(O ∩ T) = 0.1.

2. The probability that a customer requests tire replacements given they request an oil change is P(T | O) = P(O ∩ T) / P(O). Substituting the values, P(T | O) = 0.1 / 0.6 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667.

3. The probability that a customer does not request tire replacements given they request an oil change is 1 - P(T | O). Therefore, 1 - 0.1667 ≈ 0.833.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze each statement to determine its validity.

a) The t-distributions are symmetric, similar to the normal distribution. This is true.

b) The t-distributions are more spread out than the normal distribution, with lower peaks at the mean and higher tails. This is true.

c) As the degrees of freedom (df) increase, the t-distributions approach the normal distribution. This is true.

d) The smaller the df, the better the 68-95-99.7 Rule works for t-models. This is false because the 68-95-99.7 Rule applies more accurately to the normal distribution, and as df increases, the t-distributions become closer to the normal distribution.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the more serious concern for each situation, we need to understand the implications of Type I and Type II errors in the context of the scenarios:

1. **Dialysis center**: A Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis (equipment is performing satisfactorily) is incorrectly rejected, leading to unnecessary recalibration. A Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected when it should be, meaning faulty equipment is not recalibrated. In this case, a Type II error is more serious because it could result in harm to patients due to faulty equipment.

2. **Towel manufacturer**: A Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis (towels are the correct size) is incorrectly rejected, leading to unnecessary halting of production. A Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected when it should be, meaning production continues with towels of incorrect size. In this case, a Type I error is more serious because halting production unnecessarily could lead to significant financial losses and inefficiencies.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the appropriate sampling technique, I need to consider the situation described:

1. The company has offices in five different countries, and the views on smoking may vary due to local social structures. This suggests that the population is naturally divided into groups (offices in different countries) with potentially different characteristics.
2. Stratified sampling is a method where the population is divided into strata (groups) based on shared characteristics, and samples are taken from each stratum to ensure representation.
3. Cluster sampling involves dividing the population into clusters, but typically, entire clusters are selected randomly, which may not ensure representation from all groups.
4. Simple random sampling does not account for the differences between the groups (offices in different countries), which could lead to underrepresentation of some groups.

Given the need to account for the differences between the offices in different countries, stratified sampling is the most appropriate technique. It ensures that each office (stratum) is represented in the sample.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to calculate the probability of Semir rolling a 1 or 2, which corresponds to cooking a big breakfast. The probability of rolling a 1 or 2 on a six-sided die is 2/6 = 1/3.

Next, the probability of rolling a 3, 4, 5, or 6, which corresponds to having a lighter breakfast, is 4/6 = 2/3.

Now, I calculate the probability of being late for school. If he cooks a big breakfast, the probability of being late is 15%, or 0.15. If he has a lighter breakfast, the probability of being late is 6%, or 0.06. The total probability of being late is:
(1/3 * 0.15) + (2/3 * 0.06) = 0.05 + 0.04 = 0.09.

Finally, the probability of being on time is 1 - 0.09 = 0.91.

"First, I need to consider the context of the problem. The teachers' union would want to present a figure that best represents the typical salary of the majority of teachers, excluding the influence of the highly paid administrators.

Next, the mean (average) salary would be influenced by the few highly paid administrators, making it higher than the typical teacher's salary. This would not favor the teachers' union.

The mode represents the most frequently occurring salary, but it may not provide a clear picture of the overall salary distribution.

The standard deviation measures the spread of salaries but does not directly represent the central tendency, so it is not relevant for this negotiation.

The median, on the other hand, represents the middle salary when all salaries are ordered. It is not affected by extreme values (like the high salaries of administrators) and would better reflect the typical salary of the majority of teachers.

Therefore, the teachers' union would most likely quote the median salary. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine if the 2-sample t-test is appropriate, let's analyze step by step:

1. A 2-sample t-test is used to compare the means of two independent samples to infer about the populations they represent. However, in this case, the business manager used the salaries of all engineers in both offices, meaning the entire population data was used.

2. When the entire population data is available, there is no need to perform inferential statistics like a t-test, as inferential techniques are designed to make conclusions about populations based on samples.

3. Since no samples were taken and the entire population data was used, the 2-sample t-test is not appropriate in this situation.

"First, I need to analyze each statement to determine its validity.

1. Statement a) ""Influential scores have large residuals."" This is not necessarily true because influential points can have small residuals if they lie close to the regression line but still significantly affect the slope or intercept of the line.

2. Statement b) ""If the linear model is good, the number of positive residuals will be the same as the number of negative residuals."" This is not true because the number of positive and negative residuals does not necessarily indicate the quality of the model.

3. Statement c) ""The mean of the residuals is always zero."" This is true because the residuals are calculated as the differences between observed and predicted values, and the regression line is fitted to minimize the sum of squared residuals, ensuring their mean is zero.

4. Statement d) ""If the correlation is 0, there will be a distinct pattern in the residual plot."" This is not true because a correlation of 0 indicates no linear relationship, but it does not guarantee a distinct pattern in the residual plot.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine if this is a good experimental design, I need to evaluate the setup and consider potential issues.

1. The experiment involves assigning different amounts of extra reading to students in different grade levels (6th, 7th, and 8th grades). However, grade level itself could influence GPA due to differences in curriculum difficulty, maturity, or other factors. This makes grade level a lurking variable that could confound the results.

2. The design does not control for the lurking variable of grade level, as each grade level is assigned a different treatment. This means that any observed differences in GPA could be due to grade level rather than the amount of extra reading.

3. Because of this confounding, the experiment cannot isolate the effect of extra reading on GPA, making it a flawed design.

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. A sampling distribution is not just a distribution of all the statistics that can be found in a given sample. It specifically refers to the distribution of a statistic (e.g., mean, proportion) across all possible samples of a given size. So, option a is incorrect.

2. A histogram or other visual representation showing the distribution of a sample is not the definition of a sampling distribution. This describes a sample distribution, not a sampling distribution. So, option b is incorrect.

3. A sampling distribution is not necessarily a normal distribution. While some sampling distributions (e.g., of the sample mean) may approximate a normal distribution under certain conditions (Central Limit Theorem), this is not a defining characteristic. So, option c is incorrect.

4. A sampling distribution is indeed the distribution of all the values taken by a statistic (e.g., mean, proportion) from all possible samples of a given size. This is the correct definition.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the p-value for the hypothesis test. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **State the null and alternative hypotheses**:  
   - Null hypothesis (H0): μ = 4.0 ounces (the mean weight of apples is 4.0 ounces).  
   - Alternative hypothesis (Ha): μ > 4.0 ounces (the mean weight of apples is greater than 4.0 ounces).  

2. **Determine the test statistic**:  
   Since the sample size is small (n = 16) and the population standard deviation is unknown, we use the t-test. The test statistic is calculated as:  
   \[
   t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   t = \frac{4.3 - 4.0}{0.6 / \sqrt{16}} = \frac{0.3}{0.15} = 2.0
   \]  

3. **Find the p-value**:  
   The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as or more extreme than the one calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true. Since this is a one-tailed test (Ha: μ > 4.0), the p-value corresponds to the area to the right of t = 2.0 in a t-distribution with \( n - 1 = 15 \) degrees of freedom.  

   Therefore, the correct answer is: **P(t > 2)** with 15 degrees of freedom.

"First, I need to identify the type of experimental design described. The patients are randomly assigned to two groups, which suggests randomization is involved.  
Next, the two groups receive different treatments (currently marketed medicine and experimental medicine), and the lab technician is unaware of the treatment, indicating a controlled experiment.  
Finally, there is no mention of pairing or blocking based on specific characteristics, so this is not a matched-pairs or block design. It is a completely randomized design.

"To solve this, I will use the properties of the normal distribution and the z-scores corresponding to the given probabilities.

1. First, I note that 70% of the trucks weigh more than 12,000 pounds. This means the cumulative probability for 12,000 pounds is 1 - 0.70 = 0.30. From the z-score table, the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.30 is approximately -0.524.

2. Similarly, 80% of the trucks weigh more than 10,000 pounds. This means the cumulative probability for 10,000 pounds is 1 - 0.80 = 0.20. From the z-score table, the z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.20 is approximately -0.842.

3. Using the z-score formula \( z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \), I set up two equations:
   - For 12,000 pounds: \( -0.524 = \frac{12,000 - \mu}{\sigma} \)
   - For 10,000 pounds: \( -0.842 = \frac{10,000 - \mu}{\sigma} \)

4. Solving these two equations simultaneously, I calculate the mean (\( \mu \)) and standard deviation (\( \sigma \)).

After solving, the correct values are \( \mu = 15,100 \) and \( \sigma = 6200 \).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

1. The insurance agent successfully sells a policy to 20% of the customers he contacts. This means the probability of success is 0.2, and the probability of failure is 0.8.
2. To simulate this, we need to assign numbers in a way that reflects these probabilities. Since there are 10 digits (0 through 9), 20% of 10 is 2. Therefore, 2 digits should represent success, and the remaining 8 digits should represent failure.
3. Based on the choices:
   - Option a assigns 2 digits (0, 1) to success and 8 digits (2 through 9) to failure, which correctly reflects the probabilities.
   - Option b assigns 2 digits (0, 1) to success but only 3 digits (2, 3, 4) to failure, which does not reflect the 80% failure probability.

"To solve this, I need to calculate the z-score for the student's midterm score and then use that z-score to find her corresponding final exam score.

1. The z-score formula is \( z = \frac{(X - \mu)}{\sigma} \), where \( X \) is the score, \( \mu \) is the mean, and \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation. For the midterm, the student's score is 58, the mean is 52, and the standard deviation is 4. Substituting these values, \( z = \frac{(58 - 52)}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \).

2. The z-score of 1.5 will be the same for the final exam. Using the z-score formula again, but solving for \( X \), we have \( X = z \cdot \sigma + \mu \). For the final exam, \( z = 1.5 \), \( \mu = 112 \), and \( \sigma = 10 \). Substituting these values, \( X = 1.5 \cdot 10 + 112 = 15 + 112 = 127 \).

"To solve this, let's analyze the question step by step:

1. The sampling distribution of the sample mean refers to the distribution of sample means obtained from repeated sampling of a population.
2. According to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal if the sample size \( n \) is large, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution.

"To solve this, let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. The power of the test is given as 0.8. The power of a test is defined as the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (H0) when the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is true. This means that if Ha is true, the probability of rejecting H0 is 0.8.

2. The complement of the power of the test is the probability of failing to reject H0 when Ha is true. This is the probability of committing a Type II error (β). Since the power is 0.8, the probability of failing to reject H0 when Ha is true is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

3. The probability of committing a Type I error (α) is not directly provided in the problem. Type I error is the probability of rejecting H0 when H0 is true, and it is typically set by the significance level of the test. Since no information about α is given, we cannot conclude anything about the probability of committing a Type I error.

4. Based on the above, the valid conclusion is that if Ha is true, the probability of failing to reject H0 is 0.2.

1. The first quartile corresponds to the 25th percentile of the normal distribution. The z-score for the 25th percentile is approximately -0.675 (from standard normal distribution tables).
2. The formula for a z-score is \( z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \), where \( X \) is the value, \( \mu \) is the mean, and \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation. Rearranging for \( \sigma \), we get \( \sigma = \frac{X - \mu}{z} \).
3. Substituting the values: \( X = 48,815 \), \( \mu = 55,800 \), and \( z = -0.675 \). Calculate \( \sigma = \frac{48,815 - 55,800}{-0.675} = \frac{-6,985}{-0.675} = 10,356 \).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I need to determine the rainfall amount corresponding to the 10th percentile of a normal distribution with a mean of 6 inches and a standard deviation of 1.6 inches.

1. First, I find the z-score corresponding to the 10th percentile. From standard normal distribution tables, the z-score for the 10th percentile is approximately -1.28.

2. Next, I use the z-score formula to find the rainfall amount:  
   \( z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \), where \( X \) is the rainfall amount, \( \mu = 6 \) is the mean, and \( \sigma = 1.6 \) is the standard deviation. Rearranging for \( X \):  
   \( X = z \cdot \sigma + \mu \).  

3. Substituting the values:  
   \( X = (-1.28) \cdot 1.6 + 6 = -2.048 + 6 = 3.952 \).  

Thus, the highest amount of rainfall for the month to be among the 10% driest months is approximately 3.95 inches.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the most useful method for establishing cause-and-effect relationships, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a: A complete census** - A census involves collecting data from every individual in a population. While it provides comprehensive data, it does not inherently establish cause-and-effect relationships. It is more about describing the population.

2. **Option b: A least squares regression line showing high correlation** - Correlation measures the strength of a relationship between two variables, but it does not imply causation. A high correlation might suggest a relationship, but it cannot establish cause-and-effect.

3. **Option c: A simple random sample (SRS)** - A simple random sample ensures that every individual in a population has an equal chance of being selected, which helps in making inferences about the population. However, it does not directly establish cause-and-effect relationships.

4. **Option d: An experiment** - Experiments are specifically designed to establish cause-and-effect relationships. By manipulating one variable (independent variable) and observing the effect on another variable (dependent variable), while controlling for other factors, experiments can provide strong evidence for causation.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, consider the context of the question: a sports talk show is asking for opinions about officiating after a loss. Fans often express strong emotions after a loss, and officiating is a common target for blame.  
Second, evaluate the options. Option a suggests a balanced view, which is less likely in an emotional setting. Option b focuses on replacing players, which is unrelated to officiating. Option d assumes support for officials, which is unlikely after a loss. Option c reflects frustration with officiating, which aligns with typical fan reactions.  
Third, conclude that the most likely reaction is blaming the officials for the loss.

"To solve this, I will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for probabilities.

1. The probability that at least one of them asks Charlene is given as \( P(A \cup B) = 0.72 \). This can be expressed as:
   \[
   P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
   \]
   where \( P(A) \) is the probability that Alfred asks Charlene, \( P(B) \) is the probability that Ben asks Charlene, and \( P(A \cap B) \) is the probability that both ask her.

2. Substituting the known values:
   \[
   0.72 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.18
   \]

3. Simplify the equation to solve for \( P(B) \):
   \[
   P(B) = 0.72 - 0.6 + 0.18 = 0.3

Thus, the probability that Ben asks Charlene to the prom is 0.3.

"First, I need to identify the proper null hypothesis for this situation. The null hypothesis typically states that there is no difference or no relationship between the groups being compared. 

Next, in this case, the question involves comparing the proportions of ""pro-life"" men and ""pro-life"" women. The null hypothesis would state that these proportions are the same.

Finally, I need to select the choice that correctly represents this null hypothesis. The correct choice is the one that states the proportion of ""pro-life"" men is the same as the proportion of ""pro-life"" women.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I need to understand the concept of margin of error in a survey. 

1. The margin of error indicates the range within which the true population proportion is expected to fall, based on the sample proportion. In this case, the survey found that 82% of the population uses grocery coupons, and the margin of error is 3%.
2. This means the true proportion of the population that uses grocery coupons is likely to be within 82% ± 3%, or between 79% and 85%.
3. The correct answer should describe this range of possible values for the population proportion.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The power of a hypothesis test is defined as the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (H0) when it is false. Mathematically, it is given by \( 1 - \beta \), where \( \beta \) is the probability of failing to reject H0 when H0 is false.

2. From the problem, we are given that \( \beta = 0.26 \), which is the probability of failing to reject H0 when H0 is false.

3. To calculate the power of the test, we subtract \( \beta \) from 1:  
   \( \text{Power} = 1 - \beta = 1 - 0.26 = 0.74 \).

Thus, the power of the test is 0.74.

"To solve this, let's analyze the impact of adding two inches to the tallest person's height on each measure of spread:

1. **Mean absolute deviation (MAD)**: This measure depends on the average of the absolute deviations of each data point from the mean. Since the tallest person's height changes, the mean changes, and the deviations from the mean will also change. Thus, MAD will change.

2. **Standard deviation**: This measure depends on the square root of the average squared deviations from the mean. Since the tallest person's height changes, the mean changes, and the deviations from the mean will also change. Thus, the standard deviation will change.

3. **Variance**: Variance is the square of the standard deviation, so if the standard deviation changes, the variance will also change. Thus, the variance will change.

4. **Interquartile range (IQR)**: The IQR is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). Since adding two inches to the tallest person's height does not affect the quartiles (as they are based on the middle 50% of the data), the IQR remains unchanged.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the purpose of blocking in an experiment. Blocking is a technique used to group experimental units that are similar in some way that is expected to affect the response to the treatments.

Next, blocking helps to account for variability among these groups, so that the comparison of treatments is more precise. This means that blocking reduces variation within the groups (blocks), not between treatments.

Finally, the goal of blocking is to control for variability that could obscure the treatment effects, thereby improving the accuracy of the experiment.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the most useful analysis, let's break it down step by step:

1. The problem involves testing the effects of a newly developed additive on the lifespan of an engine. Lifespan is a quantitative variable, so we are dealing with means rather than proportions.

2. Each engine type is tested twice: once with the additive and once without the additive. This means the data is paired, as the same engine type is used for both conditions.

3. Since the data is paired and we are comparing means, the appropriate analysis is a matched pairs comparison of population means.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate the confidence interval and interpret it step by step:

1. The sample mean is $125,000, and the standard deviation is $32,000. The sample size is 50. The standard error (SE) is calculated as:  
   SE = standard deviation / √sample size = $32,000 / √50 ≈ $4,525.48.

2. For a 90% confidence level, the z-value is approximately 1.645. The margin of error (ME) is:  
   ME = z-value × SE ≈ 1.645 × $4,525.48 ≈ $7,445.52.

3. The confidence interval is:  
   Mean ± ME = $125,000 ± $7,445.52 = ($117,554.48, $132,445.52), which rounds to ($117,500, $132,500).

4. The correct interpretation of a confidence interval is that we are 90% confident that the true mean cost of running for a congressional seat lies within this interval. It does not mean that 90% of individual politicians' costs fall within this range.

"To solve this problem, I will use the concept of the sampling distribution of the sample mean and the standard normal distribution (Z-scores).

1. **Step 1: Identify the parameters of the sampling distribution of the sample mean.**
   - The population mean (\(\mu\)) is 4 ounces.
   - The population standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) is 0.25 ounces.
   - The sample size (\(n\)) is 40.
   - The standard error of the mean (\(SE\)) is calculated as:
     \[
     SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{0.25}{\sqrt{40}} \approx 0.0395
     \]

2. **Step 2: Calculate the Z-score for the sample mean of 3.9 ounces.**
   - The Z-score formula is:
     \[
     Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{SE}
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     Z = \frac{3.9 - 4}{0.0395} \approx \frac{-0.1}{0.0395} \approx -2.53

3. **Step 3: Find the probability corresponding to the Z-score.**
   - Using standard normal distribution tables or a calculator, the cumulative probability for \(Z = -2.53\) is approximately 0.0057.

Thus, the probability that the mean amount per jar is less than 3.9 ounces is approximately 0.0057.

"First, I need to understand the context of the problem. The goal is to study attitudes toward tracking of students in honors, regular, and below-grade classes, and the population includes students from urban, suburban, and rural communities.

Next, I need to evaluate the sampling methods. A convenience sample is not ideal because it may not represent all groups fairly. A simple random sample (SRS) could work, but it might not ensure representation from all three communities. A stratified sample divides the population into groups (strata) based on shared characteristics (e.g., urban, suburban, rural) and ensures representation from each group, which is suitable for this study. A systematic sample selects every nth individual, which might not ensure representation from all groups.

Finally, the most appropriate method for this study is a stratified sample, as it ensures representation from urban, suburban, and rural communities.

"To solve this, I will calculate the probabilities step by step using the properties of the normal distribution.

1. First, I need to standardize the resistance values (194 ohms and 188 ohms) into z-scores using the formula:  
   \( z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \),  
   where \( x \) is the resistance value, \( \mu = 200 \) is the mean, and \( \sigma = 5 \) is the standard deviation.

2. For \( x = 194 \):  
   \( z = \frac{194 - 200}{5} = -1.2 \).  
   For \( x = 188 \):  
   \( z = \frac{188 - 200}{5} = -2.4 \).

3. Next, I find the cumulative probabilities corresponding to these z-scores using the standard normal distribution table:  
   - For \( z = -1.2 \), the cumulative probability is approximately 0.1151.  
   - For \( z = -2.4 \), the cumulative probability is approximately 0.0082.

4. The probability that the resistance is between 188 ohms and 194 ohms is the difference between these cumulative probabilities:  
   \( P(188 < x < 194) = P(z = -1.2) - P(z = -2.4) = 0.1151 - 0.0082 = 0.1069 \).

5. Finally, I calculate the conditional probability that the resistance is greater than 188 ohms given that it is under 194 ohms. This is:  
   \( P(188 < x < 194 \mid x < 194) = \frac{P(188 < x < 194)}{P(x < 194)} \).  
   From step 3, \( P(x < 194) = 0.1151 \).  
   So, \( P(188 < x < 194 \mid x < 194) = \frac{0.1069}{0.1151} \approx 0.93 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the minimum sample size needed for a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of no more than 2.5%, we use the formula for sample size in proportion estimation:

1. The formula is \( n = \frac{Z^2 \cdot p \cdot (1-p)}{E^2} \), where:
   - \( Z \) is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (for 95%, \( Z = 1.96 \)),
   - \( p \) is the estimated proportion of the population (we use \( p = 0.5 \) for maximum variability),
   - \( E \) is the margin of error (2.5% = 0.025).

2. Substituting the values:
   \( n = \frac{(1.96)^2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot (1-0.5)}{(0.025)^2} \).

3. Simplify:
   \( n = \frac{3.8416 \cdot 0.25}{0.000625} = \frac{0.9604}{0.000625} = 1536.64 \).

4. Since the sample size must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest integer, which is 1537.

Thus, the minimum sample size needed is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand what it means for a sample to have a standard deviation of zero. A standard deviation of zero implies that all the data points in the sample are identical, as there is no variability.

Next, I analyze each option:
a) The standard deviation of the population is also zero. This is not necessarily true because the sample is only a subset of the population, and the population may have variability.
b) The sample mean and sample median are equal. This is true because if all the data points in the sample are identical, the mean and median will be the same value.
c) The sample may have outliers. This is false because all data points are identical, so there cannot be any outliers.
d) The population has a symmetric distribution. This cannot be concluded because the sample does not provide information about the overall population distribution.

"To solve this, I need to determine the range of customers served on the middle 50% of days, which corresponds to the interquartile range (IQR) of the normal distribution.

1. For a normal distribution, the middle 50% corresponds to the 25th percentile (Q1) and the 75th percentile (Q3). Using the z-scores for these percentiles, the z-score for Q1 is approximately -0.674, and the z-score for Q3 is approximately +0.674.

2. To find the actual values for Q1 and Q3, I use the formula:  
   \( X = \mu + z \cdot \sigma \),  
   where \( \mu \) is the mean, \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation, and \( z \) is the z-score.  
   For Q1: \( X_1 = 3250 + (-0.674) \cdot 320 = 3250 - 215.68 = 3034.32 \).  
   For Q3: \( X_3 = 3250 + (0.674) \cdot 320 = 3250 + 215.68 = 3465.68 \).

"First, I need to determine the appropriate statistical test for comparing the means of two independent groups (boys and girls) when the population standard deviations are not known. A two-sample t-test is typically used in this situation if the conditions are met.

Next, I need to check the conditions for using a two-sample t-test. The conditions include: (1) the samples are independent, (2) the data is approximately normally distributed or the sample sizes are large enough (n > 30) for the Central Limit Theorem to apply, and (3) the population standard deviations are unknown.

Finally, I evaluate the choices. The sample sizes are different, but this does not prevent the use of a two-sample t-test. The sample sizes are both greater than 30, so the Central Limit Theorem ensures approximate normality. The shape of the population distribution does not prevent the use of a two-sample t-test when sample sizes are large. Therefore, the correct answer is that the student should use a two-sample t-test because the conditions are met.

2. Using the z-score formula: \( z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \), where \( \mu = 600 \), \( \sigma = 15 \), and \( z = 0.84 \), solve for \( x \):  
   \( x = z \cdot \sigma + \mu = 0.84 \cdot 15 + 600 = 12.6 + 600 = 612.6 \).

Substituting the values:  
X = (-0.674) * 4 + 45 = -2.696 + 45 = 42.304 g.

"To determine the probability of a Type II error (denoted as β), we need to understand the relationship between α (the significance level) and β. A Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected even though it is false. The probability of a Type II error depends on factors such as the true population parameter, sample size, and the chosen significance level (α). 

1. The significance level (α) only determines the probability of a Type I error, which is rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. It does not directly determine the probability of a Type II error (β).
2. To calculate β, we would need additional information, such as the effect size, sample size, and the true parameter value under the alternative hypothesis.

2. Option a) is incorrect because the confidence interval does not provide information about one mean being twice the other. It only gives the range of the difference between the two means.

3. Option b) is incorrect because the confidence interval does not specify the actual mean life expectancies of the two models, only the difference between them.

4. Option c) is incorrect because the confidence interval does not represent a probability that the life expectancies are different. Instead, it provides a range of plausible values for the difference in means.

"First, I need to analyze each option to determine whether it is an advantage of stratified random sampling over simple random sampling.

1. Option a) states that a stratified random sample is less biased than a simple random sample. This is true because stratified random sampling ensures representation from all strata, reducing the risk of bias.

2. Option b) states that stratified random sampling has less variability from sample to sample. This is also true because dividing the population into strata reduces variability within each stratum, leading to more consistent results.

3. Option c) states that stratified random sampling can provide an equally reliable estimate with a smaller sample size compared to simple random sampling. This is true because stratified sampling ensures better representation of the population, allowing for reliable estimates with fewer samples.

4. Option d) states that a stratified random sample provides information about each stratum as well as the whole population, while a simple random sample does not. This is true because stratified sampling explicitly divides the population into strata, enabling analysis at both the stratum and population levels.

"To solve this, I will calculate the probability of losing 7 times in a row and then winning on the 8th trial.

1. The probability of losing (not landing on red) in a single trial is the complement of the probability of landing on red. Since there are 18 red slots out of 38 total slots, the probability of landing on red is 18/38. Therefore, the probability of not landing on red is 1 - 18/38 = 20/38.

2. The probability of losing 7 times in a row is (20/38)^7. This represents the ball not landing on red for 7 consecutive trials.

3. On the 8th trial, the ball must land on red. The probability of this happening is 18/38.

4. The total probability of losing 7 times and then winning on the 8th trial is the product of the probabilities from steps 2 and 3: (20/38)^7 * (18/38).

"First, we need to understand the situation. The researcher initially selected a simple random sample of 50 homes but could not contact 8 of them. To address this, the researcher selected another sample and continued until contact was made with 50 homes. This introduces potential bias because the homes where contact was made may not be representative of all single-family homes.

Next, we consider the type of bias introduced. Homes where contact was made might be more likely to have someone available, which could correlate with having children. This could lead to an overestimation of the average number of children.

Finally, we evaluate the answer choices. The correct reasoning is that the estimate is likely too high due to the bias introduced by the sampling method, which overrepresents homes where contact was easier to make.

Selecting 32 more graduates (option d) would not address the potential bias from the original nonresponders.

Finally, the best approach would be to attempt to contact the 32 nonresponders (option c) to reduce nonresponse bias and ensure the sample is as representative as possible.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I will consider each case step by step:

1. **Mutually Exclusive Case**:  
   If A and B are mutually exclusive, P(A ∩ B) = 0.  
   Using the formula for the union, P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B).  
   Substituting the values: P(A ∪ B) = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0 = 0.5.

2. **Independent Case**:  
   If A and B are independent, P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B).  
   Substituting the values: P(A ∩ B) = 0.3 * 0.2 = 0.06.  
   Using the formula for the union, P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B).  
   Substituting the values: P(A ∪ B) = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0.06 = 0.44.

3. **Subset Case**:  
   If B is a subset of A, then P(A ∩ B) = P(B).  
   Using the formula for the union, P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B).  
   Substituting the values: P(A ∪ B) = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0.2 = 0.3.

Thus, the probabilities are: 0.5 (mutually exclusive), 0.44 (independent), and 0.3 (subset).  
The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze each option to determine which is true for any discrete probability distribution of a random variable X.

1. Option a) ""The expected value of X = np"" is not true for all discrete probability distributions. This formula applies specifically to the binomial distribution, not to all discrete distributions.

2. Option b) ""The sum of all possible values of X is equal to one"" is incorrect because the sum of the *values* of X does not necessarily equal one. Instead, it is the probabilities that must sum to one.

3. Option c) ""The probabilities of all possible values of X must add up to one"" is true. This is a fundamental property of any probability distribution, including discrete ones.

4. Option d) ""The probability distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric"" is not true for all discrete probability distributions. Only specific distributions, like the normal distribution (which is continuous), have this property.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which scenario results in the narrowest confidence interval, I will consider the factors that affect the width of a confidence interval:

1. **Sample size**: A larger sample size reduces the standard error, which narrows the confidence interval. Conversely, a smaller sample size increases the standard error, leading to a wider confidence interval.

2. **Confidence level**: A higher confidence level (e.g., 99%) requires capturing more of the population parameter, which results in a wider confidence interval. A lower confidence level (e.g., 95%) requires less certainty, leading to a narrower confidence interval.

3. Combining these factors:
   - Small sample size and 95% confidence (a): Small sample size increases the width, but 95% confidence narrows it slightly compared to 99%.
   - Small sample size and 99% confidence (b): Small sample size increases the width, and 99% confidence further widens it.
   - Large sample size and 95% confidence (c): Large sample size narrows the interval, and 95% confidence keeps it narrower compared to 99%.
   - Large sample size and 99% confidence (d): Large sample size narrows the interval, but 99% confidence slightly widens it compared to 95%.

4. The narrowest confidence interval occurs with a **large sample size** and **lower confidence level (95%)**.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand that correlation is a unitless measure of the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. Changing the units of measurement (e.g., converting inches to centimeters) does not affect the correlation value.

Next, since the conversion from inches to centimeters is a linear transformation (multiplying by 2.54), the correlation remains unchanged.

Finally, the correlation between height and weight will still be 0.65 after the conversion.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the confidence level for the given range of 80 to 90 days. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the given values**:
   - Variance (\( \sigma^2 \)) = 386, so the standard deviation (\( \sigma \)) = \( \sqrt{386} \approx 19.64 \).
   - Sample size (\( n \)) = 40.
   - Sample mean (\( \bar{x} \)) = 83 days.
   - Range of interest: 80 to 90 days.

2. **Calculate the standard error of the mean**:
   The standard error (\( SE \)) is given by:
   \[
   SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{19.64}{\sqrt{40}} \approx 3.11
   \]

3. **Convert the range limits to z-scores**:
   The z-score is calculated as:
   \[
   z = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{SE}
   \]
   For the lower limit (80 days):
   \[
   z_{\text{lower}} = \frac{80 - 83}{3.11} \approx -0.96
   \]
   For the upper limit (90 days):
   \[
   z_{\text{upper}} = \frac{90 - 83}{3.11} \approx 2.25
   \]

4. **Find the cumulative probabilities for the z-scores**:
   Using a z-table or standard normal distribution:
   - For \( z_{\text{lower}} = -0.96 \), the cumulative probability is approximately 0.1685.
   - For \( z_{\text{upper}} = 2.25 \), the cumulative probability is approximately 0.9878.

5. **Calculate the confidence level**:
   The confidence level is the difference between the cumulative probabilities:
   \[
   \text{Confidence level} = P(z_{\text{upper}}) - P(z_{\text{lower}}) = 0.9878 - 0.1685 = 0.8193 \text{ or } 81.93\%.
   \]

6. **Match the closest answer**:
   The closest answer to 81.93% is **82.1%**.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate the P-value step by step:

1. **Calculate the test statistic (z):**  
   The formula for the z-test statistic is:  
   \( z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}} \),  
   where \( \hat{p} \) is the sample proportion, \( p_0 \) is the null hypothesis proportion, and \( n \) is the sample size.  
   Substituting the values:  
   \( \hat{p} = 0.35 \), \( p_0 = 0.3 \), and \( n = 95 \),  
   \( z = \frac{0.35 - 0.3}{\sqrt{\frac{0.3(1-0.3)}{95}}} = \frac{0.05}{\sqrt{\frac{0.3 \cdot 0.7}{95}}} = \frac{0.05}{\sqrt{0.00221}} = \frac{0.05}{0.047} \approx 1.06 \).

2. **Find the P-value:**  
   Since the alternative hypothesis is \( H_A: p > 0.3 \), this is a one-tailed test.  
   Using a z-table or standard normal distribution calculator, the area to the right of \( z = 1.06 \) gives the P-value.  
   From the z-table, the cumulative probability for \( z = 1.06 \) is approximately 0.8554.  
   Therefore, the P-value is \( 1 - 0.8554 = 0.1446 \).

3. **Choose the correct answer:**  
   The P-value is approximately 0.1446.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the definition of independence**: Two events A and B are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other. Mathematically, this means P(A and B) = P(A) · P(B).

2. **Check the options**:
   - Option a) P(A and B) = P(A) · P(B): This is the definition of independence, so this statement is true.
   - Option b) A and B may or may not be mutually exclusive: If A and B are mutually exclusive, then P(A and B) = 0. However, for independent events, P(A and B) = P(A) · P(B), which is nonzero if both P(A) and P(B) are nonzero. Therefore, A and B cannot be mutually exclusive if they are independent. This statement is false.
   - Option c) A and B must be mutually exclusive: As explained above, independent events cannot be mutually exclusive. This statement is false.
   - Option d) P(A|B) = P(B|A): For independent events, P(A|B) = P(A) and P(B|A) = P(B). These two probabilities are generally not equal unless P(A) = P(B), which is not guaranteed. This statement is false.

3. **Conclusion**: The correct answer is option a).

Final answer: {'sol': 'a'}"
"To determine whether this is an experiment or an observational study, I need to analyze the situation step by step:

1. In an experiment, the researcher actively manipulates one or more variables to observe the effect on another variable. In this case, the teacher implemented a specific intervention (weekly practice quizzes) to observe its effect on students' grades. This suggests it is an experiment.

2. For an experiment to allow reasonable conclusions about cause and effect, it typically requires a control group (a group that does not receive the intervention) and randomization to eliminate other confounding factors. In this case, there is no mention of a control group or randomization.

3. Since there is no control group or randomization, it is not possible to reasonably conclude that the weekly quizzes caused the improvement in grades. Other factors could have contributed to the outcome.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the best description of a P-value, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. A P-value is not the probability of making a Type I error (option a). A Type I error is the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis, and its probability is denoted by the significance level (α), not the P-value.

2. A P-value is not the probability of making a Type II error (option b). A Type II error occurs when a false null hypothesis is not rejected, and its probability is denoted by β.

3. A P-value is not the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if it is false (option c). That describes the power of a test, which is 1 - β.

4. A P-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the observed one, assuming the null hypothesis is true (option d). This is the correct definition of a P-value.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this problem, I will calculate the standard deviation of the total student costs by considering the independence of the categories and using the formula for the standard deviation of the sum of independent random variables.

1. The standard deviation of the total cost is determined by summing the variances of the independent components and then taking the square root of the result. The variance is the square of the standard deviation.
   - Variance for books: \( 65^2 = 4225 \)
   - Variance for room and board: \( 380^2 = 144400 \)
   - Variance for personal expenditure: \( 125^2 = 15625 \)

2. Since tuition has no variability (it is a fixed cost of $4500), its variance is \( 0 \). Therefore, the total variance is:
   \[
   4225 + 144400 + 15625 = 164250
   \]

3. The standard deviation of the total cost is the square root of the total variance:
   \[
   \sqrt{164250} \approx 405
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. The correlation coefficient (r) is given as 0.30, which indicates a positive but weak linear relationship between self-efficacy and job satisfaction. This means that as self-efficacy increases, job satisfaction tends to increase slightly, but the relationship is not strong.

2. To determine the proportion of variability in job satisfaction explained by self-efficacy, we square the correlation coefficient (r²). Here, r² = (0.30)² = 0.09, or 9%. This means that 9% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by self-efficacy.

3. The correct interpretation of this result is that 9% of the variability in job satisfaction is explained by the linear model with self-efficacy as a predictor. This matches choice d.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to calculate the expected value of \( X + Y \). The expected value of the sum of two random variables is the sum of their expected values:  
\( E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y) = 312 + 307 = 619 \).

Next, I calculate the variance of \( X + Y \). The variance of the sum of two independent random variables is the sum of their variances:  
\( \text{var}(X + Y) = \text{var}(X) + \text{var}(Y) = 6 + 8 = 14 \).

Finally, I confirm that the random variables are independent, as no information suggests otherwise. Therefore, the correct answer is:  
{'sol': 'c'}"
"To determine which statement is false, let's analyze the sets step by step:

1. **Median**:  
   - For set X: {10, 30, 45, 50, 55, 70, 90}, the median is the middle value, which is 50.  
   - For set Y: {10, 30, 35, 50, 65, 70, 90}, the median is also the middle value, which is 50.  
   Therefore, the sets have identical medians.

2. **Mean**:  
   - For set X: The sum of the elements is 10 + 30 + 45 + 50 + 55 + 70 + 90 = 350. The mean is 350 ÷ 7 = 50.  
   - For set Y: The sum of the elements is 10 + 30 + 35 + 50 + 65 + 70 + 90 = 350. The mean is 350 ÷ 7 = 50.  
   Therefore, the sets have identical means.

3. **Range**:  
   - For set X: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values, 90 - 10 = 80.  
   - For set Y: The range is also 90 - 10 = 80.  
   Therefore, the sets have identical ranges.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   Since all the statements (a, b, and c) are true, none of the above are false.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement a)**: ""In a well-designed, well-conducted sample survey, sampling error is effectively eliminated.""  
   - Sampling error refers to the natural variability that occurs when a sample is taken from a population instead of surveying the entire population. Even in a well-designed survey, sampling error cannot be completely eliminated; it can only be minimized.  
   - This statement is **false**.

2. **Statement b)**: ""In a well-designed observational study, responses are influenced through an orderly, carefully planned procedure during the collection of data.""  
   - In an observational study, researchers observe and record data without influencing or manipulating the variables. If responses are influenced, it would no longer be an observational study but rather an experiment.  
   - This statement is **false**.

3. **Statement c)**: ""In a well-designed experiment, the treatments are carefully planned to result in responses that are as similar as possible.""  
   - In a well-designed experiment, treatments are planned to test their effects on the responses, not to make the responses similar. The goal is to observe differences in responses due to the treatments.  
   - This statement is **false**.

4. **Statement d)**: ""None of the above is a true statement.""  
   - Since all the previous statements (a, b, and c) are false, this statement is **true**.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement I: She has good evidence of a linear relationship between the variables.**  
   - The confidence interval for the slope of the regression line is (0.45, 0.80). Since this interval does not include 0, it suggests that the slope is significantly different from 0. This provides evidence of a linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables.  
   - Therefore, Statement I is true.

2. **Statement II: It is likely that there is a non-zero correlation (r) between the two variables.**  
   - The slope of the regression line is directly related to the correlation coefficient (r). A non-zero slope implies a non-zero correlation. Since the confidence interval for the slope does not include 0, it is likely that the correlation is also non-zero.  
   - Therefore, Statement II is true.

3. **Statement III: It is likely that the true slope of the regression line is 0.**  
   - The confidence interval for the slope is (0.45, 0.80), which does not include 0. This means that it is unlikely for the true slope to be 0.  
   - Therefore, Statement III is false.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the required sample size for a proportion with a given confidence level and margin of error. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Determine the formula for sample size**:  
   The formula for the sample size \( n \) is:  
   \[
   n = \frac{Z^2 \cdot p \cdot (1-p)}{E^2}
   \]  
   where:  
   - \( Z \) is the z-score corresponding to the confidence level (for 90%, \( Z = 1.645 \)),  
   - \( p \) is the estimated proportion (if unknown, use \( p = 0.5 \) for maximum variability),  
   - \( E \) is the margin of error (here, \( E = 0.08 \)).

2. **Substitute the values into the formula**:  
   Using \( Z = 1.645 \), \( p = 0.5 \), and \( E = 0.08 \):  
   \[
   n = \frac{(1.645)^2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot (1-0.5)}{(0.08)^2}
   \]  
   Simplify the terms:  
   \[
   n = \frac{2.706 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5}{0.0064}
   \]  
   \[
   n = \frac{0.6765}{0.0064}
   \]  
   \[
   n \approx 105.7
   \]

3. **Round up to the nearest whole number**:  
   Since the sample size must be a whole number, round up \( 105.7 \) to \( 106 \).

Thus, the required sample size is 106. The correct answer is: {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I need to calculate the percentage of variation explained by the correlation coefficient. The percentage of variation explained is given by the square of the correlation coefficient (r²).

1. For a correlation of 0.6, the percentage of variation explained is \( 0.6^2 = 0.36 \) or 36%.
2. For a correlation of 0.3, the percentage of variation explained is \( 0.3^2 = 0.09 \) or 9%.
3. To find how many times the percentage explained by 0.6 is compared to 0.3, divide 36% by 9%: \( 36 \div 9 = 4 \).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the appropriate use of a census, I need to consider the situations where data is collected from the entire population rather than a sample.

1. For option a, a 95% confidence interval of the mean height of teachers in a small town typically involves sampling, not a census, as the goal is to estimate the mean height using a sample.

2. For option b, a 95% confidence interval of the proportion of students taking AP classes also involves sampling, as the goal is to estimate the proportion using a sample.

3. For option c, a two-tailed hypothesis test comparing mean expenditures between male and female students would also typically use samples from each group rather than a census.

4. Therefore, none of the options provided are appropriate for using a census, as all involve statistical inference based on samples.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this:

1. First, recall the definition of the power of a significance test. The power of a test is the probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.
2. Next, analyze the choices:
   - a) The probability that the null hypothesis is true is unrelated to the power of a test.
   - b) The probability of getting a Type I error is the significance level (α), not the power.
   - c) The probability of getting a Type II error (β) is inversely related to the power, but it is not the power itself.
   - d) The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if it is, in fact, false is the correct definition of the power of a test.
3. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I need to understand the implications of a Type II error in the context of this study. 

1. A Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis (H0) is not rejected, even though the alternative hypothesis (HA) is true. In this case, it means concluding that Heartaid is not more effective than the current medication, even though it actually is.

2. If this error occurs, patients and doctors will continue to use the current medication, missing out on the benefits of Heartaid, which is actually more effective.

3. Therefore, the potential consequence of a Type II error is that patients will continue to use the current medication, even though Heartaid is actually more effective.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I need to analyze the relationship between the percentiles of the two classes.

1. A score at the 40th percentile for the first class means that 40% of the students in the first class scored below that score.
2. The same score is at the 80th percentile for the second class, meaning that 80% of the students in the second class scored below that score.
3. This implies that the distribution of scores in the second class is generally lower than in the first class, as a score that is relatively low in the first class (40th percentile) is relatively high in the second class (80th percentile).

Based on this reasoning, the most reasonable conclusion is that students in the first class generally scored higher than students in the second class.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. The z-score of -2.46 and the P-value of 0.0069 indicate that the sample mean of 9350 pounds is significantly lower than the hypothesized mean of 9500 pounds. A P-value of 0.0069 is less than the common significance level of 0.05, suggesting strong evidence against the null hypothesis (that the mean thrust is still 9500 pounds).

2. The conclusion should focus on whether there is evidence to suggest that the new process has reduced the mean thrust. The P-value supports this conclusion.

3. The other options (a, b, c) misinterpret the statistical results. They incorrectly describe probabilities or percentages that are not directly supported by the given data.

Thus, the most reasonable conclusion is that there is evidence to conclude that the new process is producing engines with a mean thrust under 9500 pounds.

"To solve this, I will analyze the situation step by step:

1. The problem describes a point (15,2) that, when included, significantly changes the slope and correlation coefficient of the regression line. This indicates that the point has a strong influence on the statistical calculations.

2. An **outlier** is a point that lies far from the other data points, but it does not necessarily have a large effect on the regression line or correlation coefficient.

3. A **statistically significant point** refers to a point that contributes meaningfully to the statistical analysis, but this term does not describe the specific effect of altering the regression line or correlation.

4. A **point of discontinuity** is a term used in mathematics to describe a break in a function, which is unrelated to regression analysis.

5. An **influential point** is a point that, when removed, causes a significant change in the regression line or correlation coefficient. This matches the description in the problem.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
