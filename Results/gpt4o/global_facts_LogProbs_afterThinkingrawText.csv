"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a**: If the growth rate of average incomes in less developed countries was approximately zero, it would imply stagnation in economic development. However, historical data shows that many less developed countries experienced some economic growth during this period, even if unevenly distributed.

2. **Option b**: The growth rate of average incomes in less developed countries did exceed that of high-income countries during this period. High-income countries typically had slower growth rates due to already high levels of income, while less developed countries had more room for growth.

3. **Option c**: The growth rate of less developed countries did exceed that of Britain during the industrial revolution. The industrial revolution saw growth rates of around 1-2% per year, while many less developed countries experienced higher growth rates during the late 20th century.

4. **Option d**: A growth rate of approximately 3.0% per year is consistent with the average growth rate of many less developed countries during this period. However, this is not universally true for all less developed countries, as growth rates varied significantly.

"To determine the truth of these statements, I will analyze each one step by step:

1. The first statement claims that as countries get richer, the population tends to report higher average life satisfaction. Research in economics and psychology, such as the Easterlin Paradox, has shown that while there is a positive correlation between wealth and life satisfaction, the relationship is not linear and can plateau at higher income levels. However, as of 2020, evidence generally supports the idea that richer countries report higher average life satisfaction.

2. The second statement claims that important life events such as marriage or divorce do affect happiness but have surprisingly little long-term impact. Studies in psychology and happiness research, such as those by Daniel Kahneman and others, suggest that people adapt to life changes over time, and the long-term impact of such events on happiness is often smaller than expected. This statement is supported by research.

Both statements are true as of 2020.
