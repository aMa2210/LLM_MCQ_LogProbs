"Mass-society theory suggests that the media have a powerful influence over individuals, portraying them as vulnerable and passive consumers who are easily manipulated. This theory emphasizes the idea that the media can shape public opinion and behavior without much resistance from the audience.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze each option step by step:

1. Option a) suggests studying how social groups colonized different areas of the city and competed for resources. This aligns with the ecological approach in urban sociology, which examines how populations adapt to and organize themselves within urban environments, often using concepts like competition and succession.

2. Option b) refers to studying wildlife and natural habitats on the edges of the city. While this involves ecology, it is more related to environmental science or urban ecology, not urban sociology.

3. Option c) focuses on collective protests about environmental issues. This is more related to social movements or environmental sociology, not the ecological approach to urban sociology.

4. Option d) examines how men and women use public spaces differently. This is related to gender studies and urban sociology but not specifically the ecological approach.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to recall Becker's work on cannabis use, particularly his sociological perspective. Becker argued that cannabis use is not inherently enjoyable but becomes enjoyable through social learning and interaction. 

Next, I need to identify the key concept in Becker's theory, which is the idea that individuals learn to use and enjoy cannabis through social processes, such as being taught how to use it and interpret its effects.

Finally, I compare the choices to Becker's perspective. The correct answer aligns with his idea that cannabis use is learned gradually through social processes, rather than being inherently enjoyable or dangerous.

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. The middle classes in the nineteenth century were indeed an urban set, often involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations. This is true as they played a significant role in shaping urban culture and governance.

2. The middle classes were diverse, including professionals, merchants, and clerks, which made it difficult for them to have a strong sense of class consciousness. This is also true.

3. Many middle-class individuals were involved in 'white collar' work, such as clerical jobs, teaching, and other professional roles. This is also accurate.

Since all the statements are correct, the answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate each option to determine if technological forms of surveillance have made it easier to achieve the described outcomes. 

1. Option a) Technological surveillance has indeed made it easier to access and exchange private information about consumers, as seen in data collection and tracking by companies.
2. Option b) Electronic tagging is a form of technological surveillance used to monitor individuals, such as offenders, which can help reduce prison overcrowding.
3. Option c) Monitoring employees' activities at work is another application of technological surveillance, such as through cameras, software, and tracking systems.
4. Since all three options are valid, the correct answer is ""all of the above.""

"First, I need to understand the concept of gemeinschaft. Ferdinand TÃ¶nnies described gemeinschaft as a type of social relationship characterized by close, personal, and community-oriented bonds, often found in rural or traditional societies.

Next, I need to analyze the choices. Organic solidarity (a) refers to interdependence in modern, industrial societies, which is not similar to gemeinschaft. Mechanical solidarity (b) refers to the cohesion of traditional societies based on shared values and similarities, which aligns with gemeinschaft. Gesellschaft (c) refers to impersonal, individualistic relationships in modern societies, which contrasts with gemeinschaft. Anomie (d) refers to a state of normlessness, which is unrelated to gemeinschaft.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) suggests that income tax rates increased equally for all occupational groups. However, this would not directly lead to income inequality, as equal tax increases would not disproportionately affect different income groups.

2. Option b) states that there were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them. This could potentially lead to income inequality if higher-paying jobs were concentrated among a smaller group of qualified individuals, but it does not fully explain the broader trend of income inequality in the 1980s.

3. Option c) claims that the price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings. While this could affect purchasing power, it does not directly explain the growth in income inequality, as it impacts all income groups similarly.

4. Option d) points to growing unemployment making more people dependent on welfare benefits. This is a plausible explanation, as higher unemployment rates can lead to a larger gap between those with stable, high-paying jobs and those relying on welfare, thereby increasing income inequality.

After considering the options, the most likely explanation is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the question step by step:

1. The term ""normalized"" refers to the process by which something that was once considered deviant or outside societal norms becomes accepted or seen as normal within a society or group.
2. The question asks about the meaning of a deviant act being ""normalized,"" so we need to focus on the idea of acceptance or integration into normal behavior, rather than punishment, temporary status, or biological attribution.
3. Among the choices, the correct answer aligns with the idea of normalization as the process of making a deviant act no longer seen as deviant.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall the context of the 'managerial revolution' debate, which discusses the separation of ownership and control in businesses as management becomes a distinct function.  
Next, I need to identify John Scott's argument in 1997, which aligns with the idea that ownership and management were becoming increasingly separate functions.  
Finally, I can eliminate the other options as they do not directly address the core argument of the 'managerial revolution' as discussed by John Scott.  

{'sol': 'b'}"
"First, I need to identify the key focus of Marxist feminism. Marxist feminists analyze patriarchy primarily through the lens of class struggle and economic systems, emphasizing how men oppress women economically, politically, and sexually. 

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) focuses on equal rights, which is more aligned with liberal feminism. Option c) highlights women's domestic labor, which is a component of Marxist feminism but not the central explanation of patriarchy. Option d) refers to dual systems theory, which is associated with socialist feminism rather than Marxist feminism.

Finally, option b) aligns with Marxist feminism as it explains patriarchy in terms of sex classes and systemic oppression in economic, political, and sexual spheres.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall the key principles of Giddens' 'third way' as outlined in his work and its connection to New Labour's policies. The 'third way' emphasized modernization, a balance between state and market, and social investment.

Next, I analyze each option:
- a) The democratization of the family aligns with the 'third way' focus on modernizing social institutions.
- b) Putting an end to privatization contradicts the 'third way,' which sought a balance between public and private sectors rather than rejecting privatization outright.
- c) Positive welfare: 'a hand up, not a hand-out' reflects the 'third way' emphasis on social investment and individual responsibility.
- d) The strengthening of civil society aligns with the 'third way' focus on community and social cohesion.

Finally, based on this analysis, the option that was not part of Giddens' 'third way' is b) putting an end to privatization. 

{'sol': 'b'}"
"First, I need to analyze the beliefs of anti-psychiatrists like Laing & Esterson. They were critical of traditional psychiatry and its focus on labeling and treating mental illnesses as purely biological conditions. 

Next, I consider their emphasis on understanding the subjective experiences of patients and their belief that mental health issues could arise from social and familial contexts rather than just biological factors.

Finally, I evaluate the options. The correct answer aligns with their view that behavior, even if it seems bizarre, could be understood as a rational response to dysfunctional family dynamics.

{'sol': 'd'}"
"First, I need to recall the key argument made by Butler & Stokes (1969) regarding working-class support for the Labour Party. Their research emphasized the role of socialization in shaping political attitudes and party support.  
Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) aligns with their argument, as they suggested that working-class individuals were socialized into Labour support through family and community influences.  
Options b), c), and d) do not align with their focus on socialization. Rational calculation (b) and issue-based concerns (c) are not central to their argument, and false consciousness (d) is more associated with Marxist theories.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Social institutions in contemporary societies are structured and organized systems that fulfill essential functions, such as family, education, religion, and government. They are not disorganized or irrelevant, so options b) and d) can be eliminated.

2. While virtual communities in cyberspace are a part of modern life, they do not encompass the full scope of social institutions, which are broader and include physical, cultural, and societal practices. Thus, option c) is not correct.

3. Social institutions are indeed highly specialized and interrelated sets of social practices that help maintain societal order and address human needs. This aligns with option a).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of 'emotion work' as defined by Hochschild in 1983. It refers to the effort individuals put into managing their emotions to align with social expectations or norms.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) aligns with the definition, as it describes managing and presenting emotions in public settings. Option b) refers to professional work by therapists, which is not the same as 'emotion work.' Option c) describes emotional experiences but not the conscious management of emotions. Option d) discusses reflexivity and self-identity, which is unrelated to 'emotion work.'

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to identify the concept that refers to the structure of layers in society and people's movement between them. This concept involves the hierarchical arrangement of individuals or groups in a society.

Next, I recognize that this concept is commonly referred to as ""social stratification,"" which examines the division of society into layers or strata based on factors like wealth, power, and status.

Finally, I confirm that none of the other options (social control, social conflict, or social solidarity) directly relate to the study of societal layers and movement between them.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to recall Weber's four ideal types of social action. They are instrumentally-rational, value-rational, traditional, and one more type.  
Next, I remember that the fourth type is related to emotions or feelings, which helps guide the choice.  
Finally, the correct term Weber used for this type of social action is ""affectual,"" which refers to actions driven by emotions.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. An ecclesia is a term used in sociology to describe a specific type of religious organization. It is not just any religious group but one that is closely integrated with the state or society and claims authority over all members of that society.
2. Option a) describes a religious organization that claims total spiritual authority over its members, which aligns with the definition of an ecclesia. Ecclesias are often state religions or official religions of a country.
3. Option b) refers to voluntary membership, which is more characteristic of denominations or independent churches, not ecclesias.
4. Option c) describes a sect or cult with a small following, which is the opposite of an ecclesia, as ecclesias are large and dominant.
5. Option d) refers to a hierarchy of priests or leaders, which is a feature of some religious organizations but does not define an ecclesia.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context step by step:

1. After slavery was abolished, former slaves faced significant challenges in integrating into society. Many moved to cities in search of better opportunities.
2. Policymakers at the time often claimed that former slaves would adapt to urban life and integrate into the economy and society, though in reality, they often faced systemic barriers.
3. The term ""adaptation"" aligns with the idea of adjusting to new circumstances, which policymakers likely promoted as a narrative.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall Sutherland's study and his theory of differential association, which suggests that criminal behavior is learned through interaction with others.  
Next, I need to identify which choice aligns with this theory. Sutherland emphasized that people learn values, attitudes, and techniques for criminal behavior from others who view crime positively.  
Finally, I can conclude that the correct answer is the one that reflects this idea of socialization into crime through association.  

{'sol': 'a'}"
"First, I need to analyze the policies pursued by the New Labour government. New Labour emphasized education reforms, including setting and streaming pupils by ability, which aligns with their focus on standards and performance. 

Next, they promoted parental choice of schools to encourage competition and improve school standards. This was a key aspect of their education policy.

Additionally, New Labour supported state regulation and control of the curriculum to ensure consistency and high standards across schools.

However, they did not focus on supporting Local Education Authorities (LEAs) that appeared to be failing. Instead, they often bypassed or replaced failing LEAs with other mechanisms, such as academies.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider the historical context of industrialization and the family structure. Prior to industrialization, family structures were often extended, with multiple generations living together and contributing to agricultural or communal work.

Next, Stone's research suggests that the nuclear family began to emerge as a distinct unit during the transition to industrialization. This was due to the separation of work and home life, as industrialization moved work outside the home and into factories or other workplaces.

Finally, the nuclear family became more prominent as a result of these changes, marking a shift from extended family networks to smaller, self-contained family units.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) states that an MSA includes only the 10 largest cities in the United States. This is incorrect because MSAs are not limited to just the 10 largest cities; they are defined based on population and urbanized areas, not a fixed number of cities.

2. Option b) states that an MSA is composed of at least one central city with a population of at least 50,000 and it surrounds densely urbanized counties. This aligns with the definition of an MSA, which includes a central urban area with a significant population and its surrounding areas that are socioeconomically tied to the urban core.

3. Option c) states that an MSA is an area that experiences strong storms at least 50 percent of the year. This is unrelated to the definition of an MSA, as it is based on population and urbanization, not weather patterns.

4. Option d) states that an MSA is a large city with a population of at least 1 million and is immediately surrounded by suburbs. This is incorrect because the population threshold for an MSA is not 1 million; it is based on a central city with a population of at least 50,000.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze the options in relation to Mosca and Pareto's theories about the ruling elite. 

1. Mosca and Pareto both emphasized the idea of a minority group that holds power and authority, which aligns with option a.
2. They also discussed the importance of specific skills and abilities in maintaining elite status, which corresponds to option b.
3. Additionally, they described the circulation of elites, where individuals move between high-status positions while excluding others, which matches option c.

Since all these points are consistent with their theories, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify the concept Bourdieu is known for in relation to class reproduction. Bourdieu introduced the idea of ""cultural capital,"" which refers to non-economic resources such as education, tastes, and cultural knowledge that contribute to social mobility and class distinctions.

Next, I need to match this concept to the choices provided. Among the options, ""cultural capital"" directly aligns with Bourdieu's theory.

Finally, I confirm that ""cultural capital"" is the correct answer as it explains how class is reproduced through the transmission of cultural knowledge and practices.

{'sol': 'c'}"
"First, I need to understand the concept of secularization. Secularization refers to the process by which religion loses its influence over various aspects of society, culture, and individual life.

Next, I need to analyze the choices. The two related ideas in secularization often involve the decline of religious authority and the loss of religious meaning or enchantment in the world.

The most fitting pair of terms that describe this process is ""disengagement"" (the withdrawal of religion from public life) and ""disenchantment"" (the loss of spiritual or mystical significance in the world).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) suggests that the general fertility rate fell due to increases in the age of marriage and the age at which childbearing begins. This is a plausible explanation, as societal changes during this period, such as women pursuing higher education and careers, led to delayed marriage and childbearing, which are known to reduce fertility rates.

2. Option b) claims that the decline was due to there being fewer women of childbearing age. However, this is unlikely to be the main reason, as the baby boom after World War II resulted in a large population of women entering childbearing age during this period.

3. Option c) attributes the decline to errors in measurement and statistics. While errors can occur, they are not a significant factor in long-term trends like the decline in fertility rates.

4. Option d) suggests that the decline was due to diseases caused by poverty, poor housing, and bad sanitation. However, by the mid-20th century, improvements in public health and living conditions had reduced the impact of these factors in many countries.

Based on this analysis, the most likely explanation is option a). {'sol': 'a'}"
"First, I need to recall Howard's concept of the garden city. Ebenezer Howard's idea was to create self-contained communities surrounded by green belts, combining the benefits of urban and rural living.

Next, I need to analyze the choices. Option a mentions small towns surrounded by green belts and linked to a central city, which aligns with Howard's vision. Option b focuses on trees and gardens but does not capture the full concept of self-contained communities. Option c emphasizes private gardens, which is not central to Howard's idea. Option d suggests tower blocks, which contradicts Howard's low-density, self-contained community model.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of the 'third age' in the life course. The 'third age' typically refers to a period in life after retirement, characterized by active engagement, independence, and opportunities for personal fulfillment.

Next, I will evaluate the options:
a) Active non-work and independence after retirement aligns with the concept of the 'third age.'
b) Full-time employment, family-building, and adult responsibility describe the 'second age,' not the 'third age.'
c) Illness, isolation, and increasing dependence on others are more characteristic of the 'fourth age,' not the 'third age.'
d) The transition from education to work and distinctive youth cultures describe the 'first age,' not the 'third age.'

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to recall Weber's theory of authority and his concept of the state's monopoly on the legitimate use of force. Weber argued that the state is defined by its ability to maintain a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory.

Next, I need to identify which type of authority Weber associated with the legitimacy of the state's use of force. Weber categorized authority into three types: traditional authority (based on customs and traditions), charismatic authority (based on the personal qualities of a leader), and rational-legal authority (based on established laws and procedures).

Finally, Weber emphasized that the state's monopoly on the use of force is legitimated by rational-legal authority, as it is grounded in laws and rules that are accepted as legitimate by society.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a suggests that men did more housework when they identified as 'new men,' which implies a cultural or ideological shift. However, Sullivan's study focused more on practical circumstances rather than ideological changes.

2. Option b implies that men did more housework due to their wives' presence and nagging. This is not supported by Sullivan's findings, which were based on structural factors like employment status.

3. Option c suggests that men did more housework due to the invention of gadgets. While technology may have influenced housework, Sullivan's study did not emphasize this as a primary factor.

4. Option d states that men did more housework when they were unemployed or when both partners worked full time. This aligns with Sullivan's findings, as the study highlighted how employment status and shared responsibilities influenced the division of housework.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of the shift from custodial to joint parenthood after divorce. Joint parenthood implies that both parents share responsibilities for their children rather than one parent having sole custody.

Next, I analyze the choices:
a) This is incorrect because joint parenthood encourages both parents to remain involved in their children's lives.
b) This is incorrect because joint parenthood does not assign total responsibility to one parent; it is shared.
c) This is correct because joint parenthood requires both parents to cooperate in the care of their children.
d) This is incorrect because while parents should provide for their children, the focus of joint parenthood is on shared responsibility and cooperation, not necessarily equal financial provision.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall Ãmile Durkheim's contributions to sociology. Durkheim emphasized the importance of studying society through objective and observable phenomena.  
Next, I recognize that Durkheim introduced the concept of ""social facts,"" which are external to individuals and influence their behavior.  
Finally, I conclude that Durkheim believed sociology should focus on these social facts to understand societal structures and functions.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the individual who is credited with coining the term ""sociology."" Sociology as a discipline emerged in the early 19th century, and Auguste Comte is widely recognized as the founder of sociology. 

Next, I recall that Comte introduced the term ""sociology"" in his work to describe the scientific study of society and social behavior.

Finally, I confirm that none of the other options (Robert K. Merton, Karl Marx, or Emile Durkheim) are associated with coining the term, as they contributed to sociology later.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to recall the findings of Brown & Harris (1978) regarding depression. Their study focused on the relationship between social factors and depression, particularly in women.  
Next, they found that women's susceptibility to depression was influenced by their levels of social support and life events.  
Finally, this aligns with the idea that social support plays a critical role in mitigating stress and depression in women.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the choices step by step:

1. The term ""network organization"" typically refers to a flexible organizational structure where tasks and responsibilities are distributed across a network of independent entities or individuals, rather than being centralized within a single organization.
2. Option (a) suggests that work can be subcontracted out to independent suppliers and retailers, which aligns with the concept of a network organization as it involves collaboration with external entities.
3. Option (b) focuses on electronic communication, which is not a defining characteristic of a network organization.
4. Option (c) mentions the Japanese model and lateral networks, which could be related but is not the primary definition of a network organization.
5. Option (d) refers to redistributing activities equally between men and women, which is unrelated to the concept of a network organization.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to recall Margaret Mead's contributions to anthropology. She is well-known for her studies on adolescence and gender roles in different societies, particularly in Samoa and New Guinea.

Next, I need to analyze the choices. Mead's work emphasized the cultural determination of gender roles and adolescence, showing that these aspects varied significantly between societies. This aligns with choice a).

Choices b), c), and d) do not accurately reflect Mead's findings or focus. She did not claim that gender roles were biologically determined (b), nor did she compare adolescence in the USA with Japan and Europe (c). While anthropological fieldwork can have challenges (d), this is not the central point of Mead's suggestion.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. Secondary deviation is a concept in sociology, particularly in labeling theory. It refers to the process where an individual adopts a deviant identity due to societal reactions and stigmatization.
2. Option a) mentions ""the punishment or stigmatization of deviant acts."" This is partially correct because stigmatization plays a role in secondary deviation, but punishment alone does not fully define it.
3. Option b) refers to ""the labeling of an act as deviant through social reactions to it."" This is also relevant, as labeling is a key part of the process leading to secondary deviation.
4. Option c) states ""the ways in which taking on a deviant role affects future action."" This is central to the concept of secondary deviation, as it describes how individuals internalize the deviant label and continue deviant behavior.
5. Option d) ""all of the above"" could be correct if all the previous options are valid components of secondary deviation.

After careful consideration, the most comprehensive answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To answer this question, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The public sphere refers to a space where individuals can come together to discuss and debate societal issues. The Internet has had a significant impact on this space.
2. Option a suggests that the Internet represses the public sphere by promoting elite interests. While there are concerns about elite control, the Internet has also enabled widespread participation, so this is not entirely accurate.
3. Option b suggests that the Internet revives the public sphere by reaffirming freedom of speech. This is plausible, as the Internet has provided a platform for diverse voices and opinions, fostering open discussions.
4. Option c suggests that the Internet reproduces the public sphere by emphasizing face-to-face contact. This is incorrect, as the Internet primarily facilitates virtual communication rather than face-to-face interaction.
5. Option d suggests that the Internet replaces the public sphere with a superior form of communication. While the Internet has transformed communication, it has not entirely replaced the public sphere but rather reshaped it.

The most accurate answer is b, as the Internet has revitalized the public sphere by enabling freedom of speech and broader participation.

"First, I need to recall Weber's argument about the 'spirit of capitalism.' He linked it to the Protestant work ethic, particularly Calvinism.  
Next, Weber argued that Calvinists believed in predestination and sought signs of salvation through hard work and ascetic practices.  
Finally, this ascetic lifestyle and focus on disciplined labor contributed to the development of the 'spirit of capitalism.'  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The 'crisis of the 1970s' is often associated with economic and social challenges, particularly in Western countries. This includes issues like stagflation (a combination of stagnant economic growth and high inflation), declining industrial profits, and rising unemployment. This aligns with option a.

2. The eradication of the welfare state (option b) is not directly tied to the 'crisis of the 1970s.' While there were debates about the welfare state during this period, it was not eradicated.

3. Rising divorce rates and the decline of the traditional family (option c) were social trends observed during the 1970s, but they are not typically referred to as the 'crisis of the 1970s.'

4. An unfortunate twist in fashion sensibility (option d) is a humorous option and not relevant to the historical context of the 'crisis of the 1970s.'

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"The Macpherson Report was a result of the inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence and highlighted the issue of institutional racism within the police force and other social institutions. 

Step 1: The report focused on the systemic and structural disadvantages faced by ethnic minorities, particularly in the context of the police investigation into Stephen Lawrence's murder. 
Step 2: It emphasized that these disadvantages were not necessarily due to overt racism but were embedded in the routines and practices of institutions. 
Step 3: The term ""institutional racism"" was a key concept introduced by the report to describe these systemic issues.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. A primary group refers to a small, close-knit, and personal group, such as family or close friends. This does not apply to the scenario of strangers waiting at a bus stop.
2. A secondary group refers to a larger, more impersonal group formed for a specific purpose, such as coworkers or members of a club. This also does not fit the scenario.
3. An aggregate refers to a collection of people who are in the same place at the same time but do not interact or share a sense of belonging, such as people waiting at a bus stop. This matches the scenario described.

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. Environmentalist social movements increase awareness of risks that affect the whole planet, such as climate change, deforestation, and pollution. This makes option a) valid.
2. These movements often appeal to universal values like sustainability, justice, and human rights, which are shared across cultures and nations. This makes option b) valid.
3. They also use global media platforms to spread their message and generate publicity, reaching audiences worldwide. This makes option c) valid.
4. Since all three options are valid, the correct answer is d) all of the above.

"First, I need to recall Chodorow's argument about gender socialization. Chodorow emphasized the role of early attachment to the mother in shaping gender identity. 

Next, Chodorow argued that both boys and girls initially form a close attachment to their mothers. However, boys eventually break away from this attachment to develop a separate identity, while girls tend to maintain a closer connection to their mothers.

Finally, based on this understanding, the correct answer aligns with the idea that both boys and girls are closely attached to their mothers, but boys break away.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the question step by step:

1. The term 'new man' emerged in the 1980s as a cultural concept, reflecting a shift in traditional gender roles and expectations for men.
2. This concept was associated with men who embraced qualities traditionally seen as feminine, such as sensitivity, emotional openness, and a caring nature, in contrast to the traditional, stoic, and dominant male stereotype.
3. Based on this understanding, the 'new man' of the 1980s was characterized as sensitive, caring, and emotional.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze the context of the 1960s and the introduction of comprehensive schools. Comprehensive schools were designed to provide equal educational opportunities for all children, regardless of their social class or ability.

Next, I need to evaluate the reasons why class inequalities persisted. One key reason was that selective schools, such as grammar schools, continued to exist alongside comprehensives. These selective schools could admit the most academically able pupils, often from middle-class backgrounds, leaving comprehensives with a higher proportion of working-class pupils. Additionally, within comprehensives, ability streaming often replicated the divisions seen in the previous system.

Finally, I need to consider the other options. National testing and league tables (option d) were not introduced until much later, so this cannot be the correct answer. The use of restricted and elaborated codes (option c) is a theory by Bernstein, but it does not directly explain the persistence of class inequalities in comprehensive schools. Option a is partially true but does not fully address the issue of selective schools.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the key aspect of the experimental method in science. The experimental method typically involves isolating variables to determine cause-and-effect relationships.  
Next, I evaluate the choices. Option a) refers to testing research methods, which is not the primary focus of the experimental method. Option c) involves personal beliefs, which is contrary to the objective nature of the experimental method. Option d) refers to subjective interpretation, which is not a defining feature of the experimental method.  
Finally, option b) aligns with the goal of the experimental method, which is to isolate and measure the effect of one variable upon another.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. An 'open' society is generally characterized by its flexibility and inclusivity, allowing individuals to have opportunities for growth and change. It is not necessarily about granting every member equal status (option a), as hierarchies or inequalities may still exist in an open society.

2. While transparency in government (option b) might be a feature of an open society, it is not the defining characteristic. An open society is more about the freedom and mobility of its members rather than the absence of official secrets.

3. Permissive attitudes towards sexual behavior (option c) are not a defining feature of an open society. This is more about cultural norms and does not directly relate to the concept of an open society.

4. The defining feature of an open society is the ability for individuals to move between levels of the hierarchy (option d). This reflects the flexibility and opportunities for social mobility that are central to the concept of an open society.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The Nation of Islam (NOI) is a religious and political organization founded in the United States in the 1930s. Its primary focus has been on addressing the social, economic, and spiritual needs of African-Americans, particularly those who felt marginalized or excluded from mainstream American society.

2. The NOI's teachings and activities have historically centered on empowering African-Americans, promoting self-reliance, and addressing systemic racism. It has not been known to target British-born immigrants, white Americans, or African-Caribbeans specifically.

3. The group appealed most strongly to African-Americans who felt excluded from the ""ethnic melting pot"" of the USA, as it provided a sense of identity, community, and purpose.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the term 'positivism' as introduced by Auguste Comte. Positivism refers to a philosophical approach that emphasizes the use of scientific methods to study and understand society.

Next, I need to identify the key aspect of positivism. It focuses on observable phenomena and rejects metaphysical or speculative explanations, relying instead on empirical evidence and scientific reasoning.

Finally, I compare the choices. The correct choice aligns with the idea of the precise, scientific study of observable phenomena.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze the theories of racialized discourse. These theories generally argue that race is not an objective or biological fact but rather a social construct shaped by ideologies and power structures. 

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) suggests race is objective and biological, which contradicts the idea of racialized discourse. Option b) aligns with the idea that race is socially constructed through ideologies. Option c) refers to historical contexts but does not directly address the construction of race. Option d) implies individual choice and fixed identity, which is not consistent with the fluid and constructed nature of racialized discourse.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The scenario describes a situation where one person's behavior (stopping to help) influences others to do the same. This suggests a spread of behavior through observation and imitation.
2. The key concept here is the spread of behavior from one individual to others, which aligns with the idea of ""contagion"" in social psychology.
3. Contagion theory explains how emotions, behaviors, or actions can spread rapidly through a group, often leading to collective behavior.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider the impact of a new highway extending from a major city through farmland. Highways typically improve accessibility and reduce travel time between areas.

Next, I need to evaluate the choices. Option a suggests farmers will increase production, but the highway itself does not directly lead to increased farming. Option b refers to the city evolving into a multiple nuclei model, which is unrelated to the highway's direct impact on suburbanization. Option d suggests depopulation of the farmland, but highways often encourage development rather than depopulation.

Finally, option c suggests suburbanization will develop due to reduced commuting time, which is a common result of improved transportation infrastructure like highways.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall W. E. B. Du Bois's philosophy regarding African American progress after slavery. Du Bois emphasized the importance of education and leadership by a ""Talented Tenth,"" a small group of educated African Americans who would lead the way for the rest of the community.

Next, I need to evaluate the choices. Option a aligns with Du Bois's belief in the necessity of a thorough and extensive education for a select group of African Americans to achieve progress. Option b does not align with his focus on higher education and leadership. Option c reflects Booker T. Washington's philosophy, not Du Bois's. Option d does not align with Du Bois's emphasis on education and leadership.

Finally, I conclude that the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand what pluralist theories suggest. Pluralist theories emphasize the distribution of power across a wide range of groups and organizations in society, rather than being concentrated in the hands of a single elite or class.

Next, I will evaluate the options:
a) This option suggests that the state's power can be exercised through different administrative structures. While pluralism does involve multiple groups, this option focuses on administrative structures, which is not the core idea of pluralism.
b) This option suggests that the ruling elite is composed of people from various class backgrounds. Pluralism does not focus on a ruling elite but rather on the distribution of power among various groups.
c) This option suggests that political parties must compete for the votes of 'consumers' in the electorate. This aligns with pluralist theories, as they emphasize competition and the influence of multiple groups in decision-making.
d) This option suggests a close alignment between class background and party preference. This is more aligned with elite or class theories, not pluralist theories.

Finally, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze each option step by step:

1. Option a) suggests that life in modern Western cities is so different from the Third World that understanding these societies is difficult. This does not directly relate to the concept of ""over-urbanization,"" which typically refers to issues caused by excessive urban growth.

2. Option b) states that in poorer countries, rapidly developing cities drain resources from rural areas. This aligns with the idea of ""over-urbanization,"" where urban growth outpaces the ability of the economy and infrastructure to support it, often leading to resource imbalances.

3. Option c) claims that the impact of urbanization on development has been exaggerated. This does not accurately describe ""over-urbanization,"" as the term focuses on the negative consequences of excessive urban growth rather than exaggeration.

4. Option d) suggests that governments are preoccupied with urbanization in the West and neglect problems in the Third World. This is unrelated to the concept of ""over-urbanization,"" which is more about the challenges of rapid urban growth in developing countries.

The most accurate answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The capitalist class of the mid-twentieth century is characterized by their economic power and wealth, which often came from industrialization and corporate ownership rather than traditional land ownership or aristocratic inheritance.
2. Option a suggests they joined the upper class by participating in leisure pursuits and events, which may be a result of their wealth but does not directly explain their integration into the upper class.
3. Option b suggests they emulated the lifestyle and cultural values of the traditional aristocracy, which aligns with the idea of adopting behaviors to integrate into the upper class.
4. Option c highlights their ownership of companies and financial assets, which is a defining characteristic of the capitalist class but does not directly explain their social integration.
5. Option d refers to direct ownership of land and businesses, which is more characteristic of the traditional aristocracy or earlier forms of wealth accumulation, not the mid-twentieth-century capitalist class.

The most fitting explanation is that they emulated the lifestyle and cultural values of the traditional aristocracy to integrate into the upper class.

{'sol': 'b'}"
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the term step by step:

1. Inter-generational mobility refers to changes in social or occupational status between different generations within a family. This means it involves comparing the status of parents and their children.
2. The focus is on movement into different occupational or social categories between generations, not within a single person's lifetime (which would be intra-generational mobility).
3. The term does not specifically imply upward or downward movement (higher or lower income), but rather any movement between occupational categories across generations.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall the concept of the 'culture industry' as used by the Frankfurt School, particularly by thinkers like Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer. They used this term to critique the commodification of culture in capitalist societies.

Next, the term specifically refers to how cultural products (like music, films, and art) are mass-produced and sold for profit, losing their original authenticity and becoming tools for maintaining the status quo.

Finally, this aligns with the idea that the 'culture industry' critiques the commercialization of culture rather than globalization, subcultures, or new means of communication.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider Hakim's perspective on women's employment choices. Hakim's preference theory suggests that women make rational choices about their work-life balance based on their preferences and priorities.

Next, Hakim identifies three types of women: home-centered, work-centered, and adaptive. The majority of women, according to Hakim, fall into the adaptive category, but many also prioritize combining employment with family responsibilities.

Finally, based on Hakim's argument, the reason most part-time work is done by women is that they make a rational choice to balance employment with their 'home-centered' lives.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. A sect is typically a smaller, more exclusive religious group that often forms as a breakaway from a larger religious tradition. It is characterized by strong emotional commitment and a sense of exclusivity among its members.
2. Option a) mentions beliefs that can be challenged, a charismatic leader, and openness to new recruits. While a charismatic leader is often a feature of sects, the openness to challenging beliefs is not typically associated with sects, as they often have strict doctrines.
3. Option b) describes tolerance towards other religions and the separation of church and state. This is more characteristic of secularism or certain liberal religious movements, not sects.
4. Option c) highlights voluntary membership, democratic leadership, and high levels of emotional commitment. Sects do have voluntary membership and high emotional commitment, but democratic leadership is not a typical feature, as they often have a charismatic or authoritarian leader.
5. Option d) refers to the idea of the secular world as sacred, which aligns more with certain philosophical or spiritual movements, not sects.

The most accurate description of a sect is found in option c), as it captures the voluntary membership and emotional commitment, even though the leadership aspect may vary.

{'sol': 'c'}"
"First, I need to identify the process that involves acquiring a sense of identity and becoming members of society. This process typically involves learning norms, values, behaviors, and social roles.

Next, I will evaluate the options:
- a) Rationalization refers to the process of making actions or decisions based on reason and logic, not related to acquiring identity or societal membership.
- b) Colonization refers to the establishment of control over a territory or people, not related to personal identity or societal integration.
- c) McDonaldization refers to the application of efficiency, predictability, and control in various aspects of society, not related to identity formation.
- d) Socialization is the process by which individuals learn and internalize the norms, values, and roles necessary to participate in society, which directly relates to acquiring a sense of identity and becoming members of society.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the purpose of pre-testing a questionnaire. Pre-testing is typically done to ensure the questionnaire is clear, understandable, and effective in collecting the desired information. 

Next, I evaluate the choices. Option a) is about identifying important topics, which is not the primary purpose of pre-testing. Option b) is unrelated to the questionnaire itself. Option c) focuses on identifying problems with question wording and routing, which aligns with the purpose of pre-testing. Option d) is about deciding on the sample, which is not the main focus of pre-testing.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall Judith Butler's main argument in her 1999 work, ""Gender Trouble."" Butler is known for her theory of gender performativity, which suggests that gender is not an innate quality but rather something that is performed through repeated actions and behaviors.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) refers to biological determinism, which Butler critiques rather than supports. Option b) discusses opposing identities, but Butler's work challenges binary thinking rather than reinforcing it. Option c) refers to historical shifts in sex models, which is not the focus of Butler's 1999 work. Option d) aligns with Butler's theory of gender performativity, as it emphasizes the idea that gender is performed through bodily gestures and styles.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) suggests that drug use has increased and is no longer confined to a hedonistic youth subculture. This aligns with broader sociological studies indicating that drug use has spread across different demographics and is not limited to youth subcultures.

2. Option b) claims that Ecstasy is the most commonly used recreational drug. However, data consistently shows that cannabis is the most commonly used recreational drug in Britain, not Ecstasy.

3. Option c) states that teenage girls are more likely to experiment with hard drugs than teenage boys. This is not supported by evidence, as studies generally show that boys are more likely to experiment with drugs than girls.

4. Option d) argues that despite moral panics, the use of illegal drugs is very rare. This is inaccurate, as drug use is relatively common in Britain, particularly among young people.

The most accurate answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze the options and understand Murray's perspective on the 'underclass.'  
Next, I recall that Charles Murray's concept of the 'underclass' often included elements of moral behavior, reliance on welfare, and societal issues.  
Finally, I determine that Murray's view encompassed all the aspects mentioned in the choices.  

{'sol': 'd'}"
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the characteristics of the religious organizations mentioned:

1. The Church of Norway, Islam, the Church of England, and the Church of Greece are all religious organizations that are monotheistic, meaning they believe in one God. This is a common characteristic among them.

2. They are not all cultures as well as churches. While some may have cultural significance, this is not a defining characteristic for all of them.

3. They do not all practice separation of church and state. For example, the Church of England is the established church in England, and the Church of Greece has a close relationship with the Greek state.

4. They do not all exclude women as clergy. For instance, the Church of England allows women to serve as clergy, while others may not.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify the issue with the data collection process. The researcher received responses from only 300 out of 1,000 questionnaires, which is a low response rate. This suggests that the results may not represent the entire population of union members.

Next, I need to determine the type of bias that could arise from this situation. Since the results are based only on those who chose to respond, it is possible that dissatisfied members were more likely to return the questionnaires, leading to a skewed result.

Finally, the correct term for this type of bias is ""response rate bias,"" as it occurs when the responses are not representative of the entire population due to differences in who chooses to respond.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the core idea of role-learning theory. Role-learning theory suggests that individuals learn and internalize social roles based on a pre-existing framework of societal expectations and norms.

Next, I need to evaluate the options:
a) This aligns with the idea of internalizing roles from a pre-existing framework, which fits role-learning theory.
b) This suggests creating and negotiating roles, which aligns more with symbolic interactionism rather than role-learning theory.
c) This emphasizes fluidity and pluralism of roles, which is more characteristic of postmodern perspectives.
d) This focuses on suppressing unconscious motivations, which is more related to psychoanalytic theory.

Finally, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the key ideas of post-modernist writers. They often argue that we live in a world dominated by superficial and fragmented images, reflecting a shift in how reality is perceived (choice a). 

Next, post-modernist thinkers also challenge traditional theories, suggesting that no single theory is superior and that multiple perspectives are valid, which aligns with the idea of 'anything goes' (choice b).

Finally, post-modernist writers emphasize that society has undergone significant changes, necessitating new kinds of theories to understand these transformations (choice c).

Since all these points are central to post-modernist thought, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze the situation described. Leroy notices that his old neighborhood is undergoing changes, such as the construction of upscale shopping centers and single-family homes, which are increasing property values. This suggests a transformation in the socioeconomic status of the area.

Next, I need to evaluate the choices. Gentrification refers to the process where urban neighborhoods are revitalized, often leading to increased property values and the displacement of lower-income residents. Urbanization involves the growth of cities and the movement of people from rural to urban areas. White flight refers to the migration of white residents from urban areas to suburbs, often in response to increasing diversity. The demographic transition is a model describing changes in birth and death rates over time.

Finally, based on the description, the best explanation for the changes in Leroy's neighborhood is gentrification, as it aligns with the rising property values and potential displacement of residents.

{'sol': 'a'}"
"First, I need to recall Warner's study of the city of Natchez in the American Deep South, which focused on race relations and the social structure of the community.  
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the Deep South, where racial segregation and beliefs about white superiority were deeply entrenched during the time of Warner's study.  
Finally, I need to evaluate the choices. The correct answer should reflect the sharp division between black and white castes, supported by the ideology of white superiority, as this aligns with Warner's findings.  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. The introduction of compulsory education played a significant role in shaping the concept of childhood. It emphasized the idea that children should be educated and nurtured, rather than treated as small adults or laborers.

2. Increasingly emotional ties between parents and children also contributed to the social construction of childhood. This shift in family dynamics highlighted the importance of childhood as a distinct and cherished phase of life.

3. The emergence of new consumer goods for children, such as clothes, toys, and books, further reinforced the idea of childhood as a unique stage requiring special attention and care.

4. Since all of these factors contributed to the social construction of childhood, the correct answer is ""all of the above.""

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The 'mode of production' in Marx's theory refers to the way a society organizes its economic activity, including the means of production (tools, land, resources) and the relations of production (social relationships, such as between workers and owners).
2. Option a) ""the way in which products are made in a factory"" is too narrow and does not encompass the broader societal organization of production.
3. Option b) ""the average measure of productivity under capitalism"" is incorrect because the mode of production is not about measuring productivity but about the structure of production.
4. Option c) ""the organization of a society's technical and human resources"" aligns with Marx's concept, as it includes both the means of production and the relations of production.
5. Option d) ""an integral part of the superstructure of a society"" is incorrect because the mode of production is part of the base (economic foundation), not the superstructure (ideology, culture, etc.).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the term ""decarceration."" Decarceration refers to the process of reducing the number of individuals held in prisons or other forms of institutional care. 

Next, I need to evaluate the choices. 
- Option a) ""community alternatives to imprisonment and institutional care"" aligns with the concept of decarceration, as it focuses on reducing reliance on incarceration by using alternative measures.
- Option b) ""the increased use of imprisonment as the main form of punishment"" contradicts the idea of decarceration, as it implies more incarceration rather than less.
- Option c) ""transferring the management of prisons to private companies"" does not directly relate to reducing incarceration but rather to privatization.
- Option d) ""decentralized organization due to the mobility of capital"" is unrelated to the concept of decarceration.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze each option based on the context of Smart's work:

1. Smart's work often highlighted the differences in how male and female criminal behavior is perceived and treated. It is unlikely that she suggested violent crime rates were similar for men and women, as research typically shows men commit violent crimes at higher rates. So, option a is unlikely.

2. Smart's work did discuss how women's sexual delinquency was often normalized or trivialized compared to men's, reflecting societal double standards. This makes option b plausible.

3. Smart also argued that women's criminal behavior often aligns with traditional gender roles, such as crimes related to caregiving or domestic responsibilities. This supports option c.

4. If both b and c are correct, then option d (""all of the above"") could be the answer, but since a is unlikely, d is not correct.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze each option in the context of Allen's (2001) study of nurses:

1. Allen's study focused on the role of nurses and their interactions in the workplace. Emotional labor is a concept often associated with nursing, but Allen's study did not primarily emphasize this aspect. Therefore, option a) is unlikely to be correct.

2. Project 2000 was a policy initiative in nursing, but Allen's (2001) study did not focus on the de-professionalization of nursing careers due to this policy. Thus, option b) is not the correct answer.

3. While the increasing presence of men in nursing is a topic of interest, Allen's (2001) study did not specifically address this issue. Therefore, option c) is not the correct answer.

4. Allen's (2001) study highlighted the ambiguity of the nursing role and how it is constantly redefined through interactions with staff and patients. This aligns with the findings of the study.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the definitions of the terms provided. Ethnocentrism refers to evaluating other cultures based on the standards of one's own culture. Stereotyping involves oversimplified and generalized beliefs about a group of people. Scapegoating is the act of blaming a person or group for the problems of a society, often unfairly. Institutionalization refers to the process of embedding practices within an organization or culture.

Next, I need to match the definitions to the question. The question specifically asks about the practice of blaming one group for societal problems. This aligns with the definition of scapegoating.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the key focus areas of Dahrendorf, Rex, and Habermas. These sociologists are known for their work in conflict theory and their analysis of power structures in society. 

Next, I need to evaluate the options provided. Option a) focuses on social solidarity and cohesion, which is more aligned with functionalist perspectives, not conflict theory. Option b) refers to interpretive understanding, which is associated with symbolic interactionism. Option c) focuses on gendered knowledge, which is more aligned with feminist theory. Option d) focuses on power, domination, and conflict, which aligns with the work of Dahrendorf, Rex, and Habermas.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. Sreberny-Mohammadi (1996) suggests that national cultures can resist American cultural domination by domesticating its content, which includes producing more 'home-produced' programs. This aligns with the idea of promoting local culture and reducing reliance on foreign media.

2. Controlling the distribution of imported products, such as banning satellite dishes, is another way to limit the influence of American media. This would restrict access to foreign content and encourage the consumption of local media.

3. Creating 'reverse flows' of their own programs back to imperial societies is a strategy to counteract cultural domination by exporting local content to the dominant cultures, thereby promoting their own cultural narratives.

4. Since all three strategies are valid and mentioned in the context of resisting cultural domination, the correct answer is ""all of the above.""

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) suggests that flexibility was reduced by the introduction of detailed daily worksheets. This does not align with the general argument about privatization, which often emphasizes increased efficiency and performance rather than reduced flexibility.

2. Option b) states that the state had greater control than managers over production processes. However, privatization typically involves reducing state control and increasing the autonomy of companies and managers.

3. Option c) claims that ownership was transferred from small shareholders to senior managers. While privatization can involve changes in ownership, this specific transfer is not a common or central argument in discussions about privatization.

4. Option d) argues that employment depended on performance rather than trust and commitment. This aligns with the general idea of privatization, which often emphasizes performance-based systems and accountability.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze the options and consider current research trends in gender roles and the workplace. 

1. Option a suggests that in about a quarter of households with children, men stay home with the children so their wives can work. This is unlikely to be consistent with current research, as the percentage of stay-at-home fathers is much lower than a quarter of households.

2. Option b states that most women believe there is equal opportunity today between men and women in career choice, advancement, and income. Research indicates that many women still perceive significant gender disparities in these areas, so this option is not consistent with current findings.

3. Option c claims that most men believe women should be homemakers because men earn more money. This is not consistent with current research, as societal attitudes have shifted, and many men support women working outside the home.

4. Option d states that most men married to working women do not share housework and childcare obligations equally with their working wives. Research consistently shows that even in dual-income households, women often bear a disproportionate share of housework and childcare responsibilities, making this option consistent with current findings.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze each option step by step:

1. Option a) ""the formation of an attachment bond between an infant and its carer"" refers to attachment theory, which is more about emotional bonds rather than the broader process of socialization. This is not the correct definition of socialization.

2. Option b) ""a tendency of social theorists to explain everything in terms of social causes"" describes a perspective or approach in sociology but does not define the process of socialization. This is not correct.

3. Option c) ""the process of becoming part of a society by learning its norms and values"" accurately describes socialization, as it involves individuals learning and internalizing the norms, values, and behaviors necessary to participate in society. This is the correct definition.

4. Option d) ""the historical process by which societies change from traditional to modern"" refers to social change or modernization, not socialization. This is not correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) refers to culturally valued commodities and standards of living, which is more related to social or cultural deprivation rather than the definition of 'assets.' This is not correct.
2. Option b) describes income, which is the flow of money a person receives from their salary or wage. This is not the definition of 'assets.'
3. Option c) defines a stock of economic resources, including land, shares, and bank deposits. This aligns with the definition of 'assets,' which are resources owned by an individual or entity that have economic value.
4. Option d) refers to population groups with differing amounts of wealth, which is more about wealth distribution rather than the definition of 'assets.'

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct order of status and precedence, I will analyze each option step by step:

a) Prime Minister, Archbishop of York, Viscounts of England:
- The Prime Minister is a political position and does not hold a hereditary rank in the peerage. The Archbishop of York is a high-ranking ecclesiastical figure, and Viscounts are members of the nobility. This order is incorrect because the Prime Minister does not outrank the Archbishop or Viscounts in terms of traditional hierarchy.

b) Marquesses of England, Earls of Great Britain, King's Brothers:
- Marquesses rank higher than Earls in the peerage system. However, the King's Brothers (if they are princes) would outrank both Marquesses and Earls. This order is incorrect.

c) Esquires, Serjeants of Law, Dukes' Eldest Sons:
- Esquires are below Serjeants of Law, and both are far below Dukes' Eldest Sons in status. This order is incorrect.

d) King's Grandsons, Lord High Treasurer, Companions of the Bath:
- The King's Grandsons (if they are princes) would have the highest status. The Lord High Treasurer is a high-ranking official, and Companions of the Bath are members of an order of chivalry, which is lower in precedence. This order is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) refers to creative activities like gardening, cookery, and craftwork. These are hobbies or activities, not related to the concept of social norms, which are about rules and expectations in society.

2. Option b) mentions the symbolic representation of social groups in the mass media. While this relates to how groups are portrayed, it does not define social norms, which are more about behavioral expectations.

3. Option c) talks about religious beliefs about how the world ought to be. While religious beliefs can influence social norms, they are not the same as social norms themselves.

4. Option d) describes rules and expectations about interaction that regulate social life. This aligns with the definition of social norms, which are shared guidelines or rules that dictate acceptable behavior in society.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. A nuclear family typically refers to a family structure that includes two generations: parents and their children. This is a more specific definition compared to extended families or other forms of family units.
2. Option a refers to people sharing living accommodations and meals, which could describe a household but not specifically a nuclear family.
3. Option b describes a network of relatives extended across generations, which aligns more with the concept of an extended family rather than a nuclear family.
4. Option c refers to the new family created when an adult leaves home and gets married, which is not the specific definition of a nuclear family.
5. Option d accurately describes a nuclear family as a two-generation unit of parents and their children.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) suggests that people vote based on pragmatic issues and concerns. While this may be true in some cases, it does not fully capture the essence of new social movements, which often focus on broader cultural, environmental, and personal issues rather than just pragmatic concerns.

2. Option b) states that consumer identities are more important than class identities. This could be partially true in the context of new social movements, as they often transcend traditional class-based politics. However, this alone does not encompass the full scope of what new social movements represent.

3. Option c) highlights that personal, cultural, and environmental issues can mobilize political consciousness just as much as economic interests. This is a key characteristic of new social movements, as they often focus on issues like identity, human rights, and environmental sustainability, which go beyond traditional economic concerns.

4. Option d) suggests that all of the above are correct. However, while options a) and b) may have some relevance, they do not fully capture the primary focus of new social movements as well as option c) does.

Therefore, the best answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify which sociological perspective emphasizes society as a system of interdependent and coordinated parts.  
Functionalism is a perspective that views society as a complex system whose parts work together to promote stability and social order.  
Conflict theory focuses on power struggles and inequalities, not on interdependence.  
Symbolic interactionism examines individual interactions and meanings, not the system as a whole.  
Role theory focuses on roles individuals play, not the broader system.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand what Post-Fordist forms of media production and consumption entail. Post-Fordism refers to a shift from mass production and standardized products (Fordism) to more flexible production systems that cater to diverse and niche markets.

Next, I analyze the options:
a) This describes Fordist production, not Post-Fordist, as it focuses on mass production and passive audiences.
b) This is unrelated to the concept of Post-Fordism, as it focuses on television models rather than production flexibility or niche targeting.
c) This aligns with Post-Fordist principles, as it emphasizes diversity and targeting niche markets.
d) This is unrelated to Post-Fordist media production and consumption, as it focuses on advertisements for a specific industry.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To answer this question, I will consider the key concepts in Marxist theory:

1. Marx distinguishes between a ""class in itself"" and a ""class for itself."" A ""class in itself"" refers to a group of people who share common economic conditions (e.g., the working class under capitalism). However, they may not yet be aware of their shared interests or act collectively.

2. A ""class for itself"" emerges when the working class becomes conscious of its shared interests and begins to organize and act collectively to challenge the capitalist system.

3. Marx believed that the development of the labor movement and factory-based production would lead to the working class becoming a ""class for itself,"" as they would gain awareness of their exploitation and unite to fight for their rights.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze the question step by step:

1. The 'health transition' refers to the shift in patterns of health and disease as societies develop, often linked to changes in lifestyle, environment, and healthcare.
2. Stage 3 of the health transition is characterized by a decline in infectious diseases due to improved sanitation, vaccination, and antibiotics, and an increase in chronic, degenerative diseases as people live longer and adopt modern lifestyles.
3. Chronic, degenerative diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and strokes become the leading causes of illness and death in this stage.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider the context of Bordo's work and her analysis of anorexia in Western cultures. Bordo (1993) discusses how cultural and societal factors influence body image and eating disorders.

Next, I need to evaluate the options provided. Option a refers to a frugal lifestyle, which is not the primary focus of Bordo's analysis. Option b refers to traditional images of women, which Bordo critiques but does not directly link to the 'epidemic' of anorexia. Option c discusses the social construction of mental illness, which is a broader concept and not specific to Bordo's argument about anorexia. Option d aligns with Bordo's analysis, as she connects the rise of anorexia to cultural ideals of femininity, achievement, and control.

Finally, I conclude that the correct answer is the one that best reflects Bordo's argument about the cultural and societal factors contributing to anorexia. 

{'sol': 'd'}"
"To solve this, I will analyze the question and the provided choices step by step:

1. The question asks about the difficulty in ""operationalizing"" concepts like social class. Operationalizing means defining a concept in measurable terms so it can be studied empirically.
2. Social class is a complex and contested concept, and the difficulty often lies in the variability of definitions and indicators, which can make comparisons challenging.
3. Among the choices:
   - a) This option highlights the variability in definitions and indicators, which aligns with the main difficulty in operationalizing social class.
   - b) This option suggests there are no reliable indicators, but this is not entirely true; there are indicators, though they may vary.
   - c) This option is not relevant to the question, as it humorously refers to ""armchair theorising.""
   - d) This option is incorrect because operationalizing concepts is crucial for applied, empirical research.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The 1990 reform of the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK introduced significant changes, including the creation of self-governing hospital trusts. These trusts were designed to operate more independently and compete for contracts from health authorities, which were responsible for purchasing healthcare services.

2. Option a) aligns with this reform, as it describes hospitals becoming self-governing trusts that competed for purchasing contracts. This was a key feature of the internal market introduced in the NHS during this period.

3. The other options do not accurately reflect the changes brought about by the 1990 reform:
   - b) is incorrect because hospitals were not solely dependent on central government funding; they were expected to compete for contracts.
   - c) is incorrect because hospitals did not become providers of private healthcare; they remained part of the NHS.
   - d) is incorrect because the reform aimed to make hospitals more efficient, not less, and demand for healthcare was not falling.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **The expansion of private security companies**: During the 1980s and 1990s, there was indeed a significant growth in private security companies, as governments increasingly relied on private firms for various security-related tasks.

2. **The building of private prisons**: Privatization of prisons became a notable trend during this period, with private companies being contracted to build and manage correctional facilities.

3. **The introduction of market disciplines to measure police performance**: Market-based approaches, such as performance metrics and efficiency measures, were introduced to evaluate police performance, aligning with broader trends of privatization and market discipline.

4. **All of the above**: Since all the above points are true and reflect the privatization of law and order during this period, this option is the most comprehensive.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to recall the concept of the 'correspondence principle' by Bowles and Gintis. This principle suggests that the structure and norms of schools mirror the structure and norms of the workplace in a capitalist society. 

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) aligns with the correspondence principle, as it implies that schools prepare children for work by instilling obedience, which is a key aspect of workplace behavior. Option b) is unrelated to the correspondence principle, as it focuses on attitudes of teachers and parents rather than the relationship between schools and work. Option c) is about language development, which is not relevant to the correspondence principle. Option d) discusses gender achievements, which is also unrelated to the principle.

Finally, based on the analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a**: Middle-class owner-occupiers moving into the inner city through gentrification is more characteristic of late 20th-century urban trends, not the mid-20th century. This option is unlikely to be correct.

2. **Option b**: Working-class communities forming in the inner cities while the middle classes moved out to the suburbs aligns with the historical trend of suburbanization in mid-20th century Britain. This was a period when middle-class families sought better living conditions outside the crowded and industrialized inner cities, leaving the working class concentrated in urban areas.

3. **Option c**: The middle classes living in the countryside while the working class lived in the city is not entirely accurate for mid-20th century Britain. While some middle-class families moved to suburban areas, this does not imply a complete rural-urban divide.

4. **Option d**: The idea that the upper and middle classes dominated public space while working-class people were more home-centered is not a defining feature of class segregation in mid-20th century Britain. This option is less relevant to the question.

Based on the analysis, the most accurate answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall Charles Cooley's theory of the looking-glass self. This theory emphasizes the idea that an individual's self-concept develops through their perception of how others view them. 

Next, I need to analyze the choices. Option a refers to the realization of a separate identity, which is not the focus of Cooley's theory. Option b mentions the difficulty of seeing oneself as others do, which is not central to the theory. Option d emphasizes physical appearance, which is not the primary focus of the looking-glass self.

Finally, option c aligns with the theory, as it highlights that one's self-concept is based on the perception of how others see them.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a**: Queer Theory does not claim that heterosexuality is the normal and most desirable way to be. In fact, it challenges the idea of heterosexuality as the norm and critiques heteronormativity.

2. **Option b**: Queer Theory does not argue that sexual categories and discourses are based on true, underlying biological differences. Instead, it often critiques essentialist views of sexuality and gender, emphasizing their social and cultural construction.

3. **Option c**: While Queer Theory does explore power dynamics and the ways in which certain forms of masculinity or femininity are perceived, this is not its central claim. It focuses more broadly on deconstructing fixed categories of sexuality and gender.

4. **Option d**: This aligns with Queer Theory's central claim. It posits that all sexualities are pluralistic, fragmented, and subject to reconstruction, challenging fixed and binary understandings of sexuality and gender.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to recall the context of Scott's (1991) work and the concept of the 'power elite.' Scott's use of the term builds on earlier sociological theories, particularly those of C. Wright Mills, who described the 'power elite' as a small group of individuals who hold significant power in society.

Next, I need to analyze the options. Option a refers to the Marxist concept of the ruling class exploiting the proletariat, which is not specific to Scott's 'power elite.' Option b describes a capitalist class based on property ownership, which is related but not the specific focus of Scott's term. Option c refers to an alignment of classes without state power, which does not align with the idea of a 'power elite.' Option d, however, aligns with Scott's description of a state elite drawn from a power bloc, emphasizing the interconnectedness of elite groups in society.

Finally, based on the analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify the method described. The sociologist is directly involved in the environment, observing and recording data while being on staff at the hospital. This suggests an immersive approach.  
Next, I need to match this description to the options provided. Experimentation involves controlled testing, which is not the case here. Secondary data analysis involves analyzing pre-existing data, which is also not applicable. Survey administration involves distributing and collecting surveys, which is not mentioned. Participant observation, however, involves the researcher immersing themselves in the environment to observe and record data, which matches the description.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall the concept of the 'generalized other' in Mead's Symbolic Interactionist theory. Mead described the 'generalized other' as the perspective of the broader society or community that individuals internalize during socialization.

Next, I need to evaluate the options:
a) This refers to structural theories, which is unrelated to the 'generalized other.'
b) This describes self-presentation, not the 'generalized other.'
c) This refers to a specific figure in early childhood, which is more aligned with the concept of a 'significant other,' not the 'generalized other.'
d) This aligns with the idea of the 'generalized other,' as it involves understanding how society perceives our behavior.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to recall the key argument made by Davis (1995) regarding women's motivations for seeking cosmetic surgery.  
Next, Davis emphasizes the role of cultural ideals and how women may perceive certain body parts as stigmatizing when compared to these ideals.  
Finally, this aligns with the idea that women seek surgery to address perceived stigmatization rather than external pressures or a generalized pursuit of perfection.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall Marx's theory of alienation as described in his 1844 manuscripts. Marx argued that under capitalism, workers are alienated in several ways.  
Second, workers are alienated from the product they create because they do not own it; it is owned by the capitalist.  
Third, workers are alienated from the production process because they have no control over how or what they produce.  
Fourth, workers are alienated from each other and humanity in general because capitalism fosters competition rather than cooperation.  
Thus, Marx claimed that workers are alienated in all these ways.  
The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to recall the key findings of Herberg's 1955 study of religion in America. His study emphasized how religion played a role in the assimilation of ethnic minorities, particularly as a way to achieve social acceptance in American culture. This aligns with option a.

Next, Herberg also noted that mainstream faiths, such as Protestantism, Catholicism, and Judaism, were increasingly tied to American national identity, which supports option b.

Finally, Herberg observed that the moral teachings of these major religions were converging, reflecting a shared set of values, which aligns with option c.

Since all three points are valid and supported by Herberg's study, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the perspective of Structural-Functionalism. Structural-Functionalists view society as a system of interrelated parts that work together to maintain stability and order. 

Next, I need to evaluate the choices. 
- Option a describes micro-level interactions, which is more aligned with symbolic interactionism, not Structural-Functionalism.
- Option b focuses on conflict and inequality, which aligns with conflict theory, not Structural-Functionalism.
- Option c suggests instability, which contradicts the Structural-Functionalist emphasis on stability and order.
- Option d aligns with the Structural-Functionalist view, as it emphasizes roles and institutions as part of a normative framework that maintains societal stability.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to recall the findings of Charles Booth's 1901 study on poverty in London.  
Booth's study revealed that a significant portion of London's population was living in poverty.  
The specific percentage identified in his study was 30.70%.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the traditional working-class identity and its historical context. It was often rooted in shared experiences and social structures.  
Next, I analyze the options. Shared working conditions in the manufacturing industry (a) were significant but not the sole basis of identity. Class consciousness (b) was more theoretical and not universally present. Collective aspirations to move into the middle class (d) were not a defining feature of traditional working-class identity.  
Finally, local communities, extended kinship networks, and shared leisure pursuits (c) were central to the traditional working-class identity, as they provided a sense of belonging and solidarity.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand what Bernstein meant by 'restricted codes' of language. Restricted codes are typically associated with short, simple sentences and a limited vocabulary, often used in informal settings or within close-knit groups.

Next, I need to consider why Bernstein believed this disadvantaged pupils at school. Schools often require the use of 'elaborated codes,' which involve more complex sentence structures and a broader vocabulary, enabling explicit and context-independent communication.

Finally, I need to match this reasoning to the choices provided. The correct answer would highlight how restricted codes limit children's ability to succeed in the school environment due to their simplicity and limited vocabulary.

{'sol': 'd'}"
"First, I need to understand the definition of telework. Telework refers to a form of employment where individuals work remotely, often from home, and use information technology to communicate and perform their tasks.

Next, I will evaluate the options:
a) Running one's own business through telephone helplines or hotlines does not align with the concept of telework, as it focuses on self-employment rather than working for an outside employer.
b) Working at home for an outside employer, using information technology, fits the definition of telework, as it involves remote work facilitated by technology.
c) Babysitting and other jobs within a local network, through the informal economy, do not involve the use of information technology or working for an outside employer, so this is not telework.
d) Combining non-manual work with the leisure activity of watching television does not describe telework, as it does not emphasize the use of information technology or remote employment.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall Frank's (1967) dependency theory, which argues that underdeveloped societies are not underdeveloped due to internal factors but because of their economic dependence on wealthier nations.  
Next, I need to identify the choice that aligns with this idea. Frank emphasized the exploitation of underdeveloped societies by wealthier countries, leading to economic dependency.  
Finally, the correct answer is the one that reflects this economic dependency and exploitation.  

{'sol': 'c'}"
"To solve this, I will analyze the claim and the context of the former Soviet Union:

1. Kerr et al.'s (1960) claim is likely related to the relationship between political systems and industrial technology. The former Soviet Union was a totalitarian regime that achieved significant industrial and technological advancements, particularly during the mid-20th century.
2. This suggests that advanced industrial technology did not weaken the power of the totalitarian regime but rather strengthened it, as the Soviet Union used technology to consolidate control and maintain its power.
3. Based on this reasoning, the correct answer aligns with the idea that advanced industrial technology strengthens the power of totalitarian regimes.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the context of the print revolution in the nineteenth century. This period was marked by advancements in printing technology, such as the steam-powered press, which allowed for mass production of printed materials.

Next, I consider the implications of mass production. It led to mass circulation of newspapers and books, making them more accessible to the general public. However, it also resulted in a shift in content, with some arguing that serious content declined in favor of more sensational or popular material to appeal to a broader audience.

Finally, I evaluate the choices. The correct answer aligns with the historical context of mass production and circulation, as well as the potential decline in serious content. The other options (public ownership of newspapers, cinema as a leisure activity, and virtual communities on the Internet) are not relevant to the nineteenth-century print revolution.

{'sol': 'a'}"
"First, I need to understand the term 'feminist standpoint.' It refers to a theoretical perspective in feminist theory that emphasizes understanding and analyzing society from the perspective of women's experiences and knowledge.

Next, I need to evaluate the options:
a) This does not align with the concept of feminist standpoint, as it does not focus on studying society from women's perspectives.
b) This aligns with the idea of feminist standpoint, as it emphasizes studying society from the perspective of women.
c) While recognizing diversity in women's lives is important, it is not the central focus of the feminist standpoint theory.
d) This is incorrect, as feminist standpoint theory does not ignore the gendered nature of knowledge; rather, it highlights it.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Ethnographic research focuses on understanding human behavior, culture, and social interactions in their natural settings. It typically involves methods like participant observation and in-depth interviews, which produce descriptive, narrative data rather than numerical data. This suggests that the findings are not primarily aimed at statistical analysis, so option a) is incorrect.

2. While ethnographic research can be conducted over a long period, the duration of the research does not inherently determine whether the data is qualitative or quantitative. Therefore, option b) is not the best answer.

3. Ethnographic research aims to uncover rich, detailed accounts of people's lives, often from an insider's perspective. This aligns with the nature of qualitative data, which focuses on depth and context rather than numerical measurement. This makes option c) a strong candidate.

4. Comparing findings from different cases is more characteristic of comparative research or meta-analysis, and while ethnography can involve multiple cases, this is not the primary reason it produces qualitative data. Thus, option d) is not the best answer.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall Marx's perspective on religion. Marx viewed religion as a tool used by the ruling class to maintain control over the working class, describing it as the ""opium of the people.""

Next, I need to consider the context of Marx's theory. He believed that religion served as a form of ideology that justified the inequalities of capitalism and that it would fade away once the conditions that necessitated itânamely, the capitalist systemâwere removed.

Finally, I can conclude that Marx argued religion would disappear after a socialist revolution, as this would eliminate the need for the ideological function of religion in justifying exploitation.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze each option to determine whether it aligns with the features of globalization.  
Option a) ""An increasing awareness of the world as a whole"" is a feature of globalization, as it involves interconnectedness and global awareness.  
Option b) ""The extended power of nation states"" is not typically a feature of globalization, as globalization often reduces the power of nation-states in favor of global institutions and multinational corporations.  
Option c) ""The destruction of distance through communications technologies"" is a feature of globalization, as advancements in technology have made communication and interaction across distances much easier.  
Option d) ""The stretching of social relations beyond national boundaries"" is a feature of globalization, as it involves the expansion of social, economic, and cultural interactions across borders.  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Absolute poverty** refers to a condition where an individual lacks the basic necessities of life, such as food, shelter, and clothing. This is unrelated to changes in social position, so this option is incorrect.

2. **Relative poverty** refers to being poor in comparison to others in society, but it does not involve a change in social position. This option is also incorrect.

3. **Vertical mobility** refers to moving up or down the social hierarchy, which directly relates to gaining a higher or lower social position than one was born into. This matches the scenario described in the question.

4. **Horizontal mobility** refers to a change in position within the same social level, such as switching jobs without a change in social status. This does not match the scenario described.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the types of questions mentioned. Fixed-choice questions provide specific options for respondents to choose from, which are useful for structured data collection. Short questions are concise and easy to understand, which is generally a good practice. Funnelled questions start broad and become more specific, which can help guide respondents logically.

Next, leading questions are those that suggest a particular answer or influence the respondent's response, which can bias the survey results.

Finally, since the goal of a survey is to collect unbiased and accurate data, it should avoid leading questions.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the theory that explains the transition of societies from traditional to modern, industrial forms of organization.  
Next, I recognize that this theory is associated with the idea of progress and development, often emphasizing economic growth, technological advancement, and social change.  
Finally, the correct term for this theory is ""Modernization theory,"" which aligns with the description provided.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Age: While age can influence social status in some cultures, it is not a primary measure of social status in modern societies.
2. Income: Income is a significant factor in determining social status, as it often reflects a person's financial success and access to resources.
3. Verbal fluency: Verbal fluency may contribute to a person's social interactions but is not a standard measure of social status.
4. Occupation: Occupation is closely tied to social status, as it often reflects a person's level of education, skills, and societal contribution.

Between income and occupation, occupation is more commonly used as a measure of social status in modern societies because it encompasses both income and societal roles.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Sociology is a scientific discipline that relies on systematic research and evidence, rather than personal experiences. Therefore, option a) is incorrect because sociology does not focus on the researchers' own experiences.

2. Sociology aims to understand and explain social phenomena as they are, based on empirical evidence, rather than prescribing how the world ought to be. This makes option b) incorrect, as sociology does distinguish between the way the world is and the way it ought to be.

3. Sociology builds its knowledge base through systematic research conducted in various contexts, using diverse methodologies and perspectives. This aligns with option c), as sociology's knowledge is indeed accumulated from many different research contexts.

4. Sociology strives to be objective and unbiased, using rigorous methods to minimize subjectivity. Therefore, option d) is incorrect because sociology is not inherently subjective or biased.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of world-affirming religions. These religions typically accept the goals and values of mainstream society but provide alternative or new methods to achieve personal or spiritual fulfillment.  
Next, I need to evaluate the choices.  
a) This aligns with the definition of world-affirming religions, as they embrace conventional values but offer new means to achieve them.  
b) This describes a reaction against mainstream religious teachings, which does not align with world-affirming religions.  
c) This suggests disapproval of mainstream values, which is more characteristic of world-accommodating or world-rejecting religions.  
d) This describes world-rejecting religions, which reject both societal goals and means.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to recall the concept of the 'extension pattern' as identified by Parker (1976). This pattern refers to the relationship between work and leisure, where leisure activities extend the interests and skills of one's work life.  
Next, I need to identify which group of workers this pattern applies to. Parker associated the 'extension pattern' with professionals and skilled workers, whose work interests and skills often spill over into their leisure activities.  
Finally, I compare this understanding with the given choices to find the correct match. The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall Weber's concept of 'class situation.' Weber defined class in terms of economic resources and market position, focusing on how individuals' access to goods, opportunities, and life chances is determined by their position in the market.

Next, I need to evaluate the options:
a) This refers to Marx's concept of class exploitation, not Weber's.
b) While Weber did discuss status and life chances, this option emphasizes consciousness, which is more aligned with status groups rather than class situation.
c) This aligns with Weber's definition, as it focuses on a person's position in the market and their economic resources.
d) This refers to lifestyle and consumption patterns, which are more related to status groups than class situation.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the question step by step:

1. The question refers to the introduction of market principles to educational policy in the 1980s. Market principles typically involve competition, accountability, and consumer choice.
2. In the context of education, this often led to policies such as school choice, national testing, and inspections to ensure accountability and standards.
3. Among the options provided:
   - a) More funding for students in higher education: This is unrelated to market principles in primary and secondary education.
   - b) Delegation of power and budgetary control to LEAs (Local Education Authorities): This is contrary to market principles, which often reduce the role of centralized authorities.
   - c) A reduction in parental choice of school: Market principles aim to increase, not reduce, parental choice.
   - d) Increased state regulation through national testing and inspections: This aligns with market principles, as it introduces accountability and standardization.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to recall the main argument of Smith & Tomlinson. Their research focused on the impact of racism and inequality in schools, particularly how it affected children from ethnic minorities.  
Next, I need to evaluate the choices. Option a suggests ethnic background is more significant than class or gender, but this does not align with their focus on racism in schools. Option b highlights racism in schools undermining equality of opportunity, which matches their argument. Option c emphasizes school character over ethnic background, which is not their primary focus. Option d attributes gender differences to class inequalities, which is unrelated to their argument.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the concept of a 'post-industrial society' as identified by Daniel Bell in 1973:

1. Bell's concept of a post-industrial society primarily focuses on the transition from an industrial-based economy to one centered on services, knowledge, and information. This shift emphasizes the importance of intellectual technology and professional expertise over traditional manufacturing and industrial production.

2. Option (a) mentions the increasing power of trade unions in resolving industrial disputes. While trade unions were significant during the industrial era, Bell's post-industrial society does not emphasize this aspect.

3. Option (b) suggests a resurgence of interest in industrial production and manufacturing. This is contrary to the idea of a post-industrial society, which moves away from industrial production towards a service-oriented economy.

4. Option (c) aligns with Bell's theory, as it highlights the shift towards a service economy based on knowledge and information, which is the core of the post-industrial society.

5. Option (d) includes all of the above, but since options (a) and (b) are not consistent with Bell's concept, this cannot be correct.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) suggests that white-collar crime involves only small amounts of money. This is incorrect because white-collar crimes often involve large sums of money, such as embezzlement or fraud.

2. Option b) states that the proletariat can outsmart the bourgeoisie. This is unrelated to the visibility of white-collar crime and does not address the question.

3. Option c) claims that the police turn a blind eye to corporate crime. While enforcement may be challenging, this does not directly explain why white-collar crime is low in visibility.

4. Option d) explains that white-collar crime goes undetected in the context of everyday business transactions. This is accurate because white-collar crimes are often embedded in routine business practices, making them harder to detect and less visible.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a**: Industrial capitalism introduced structured work schedules, which created distinct periods of work and non-work. This allowed for the emergence of leisure as a time for relaxation and non-work activities. This option is valid.

2. **Option b**: Leisure activities were often regulated and organized to maintain social order, especially in urban industrial societies. This included activities like sports, fairs, and other communal events. This option is also valid.

3. **Option c**: The growth of civic and municipal culture, such as the establishment of public libraries, museums, and art galleries, was a significant aspect of leisure during industrial capitalism. These institutions provided spaces for education and recreation. This option is valid as well.

4. **Option d**: Since all the above options are valid, this option, which includes all of them, is the correct answer.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. A moral panic typically involves widespread fear or concern over an issue that is perceived to threaten societal norms or values. This often involves the media amplifying the issue, leading to public outcry and hostility toward the perceived threat.
2. Option a) aligns with this definition, as it describes the media exaggerating reports of deviant groups, which generates hostile reactions.
3. The other options do not fit the definition of a moral panic. Option b) refers to media influence on behavior, not the societal reaction. Option c) involves challenging stereotypes, which is unrelated to moral panic. Option d) concerns cultural concerns, not moral panic.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of the 'demographic transition.' It refers to the shift in population characteristics as societies develop economically and socially, typically moving through stages.

Next, I analyze the stages of demographic transition. Initially, societies have high birth and death rates, leading to a stable population. As industrialization and healthcare improve, death rates decline, followed by a decline in birth rates. This results in slower population growth, greater life expectancy, and an ageing population.

Finally, I compare the choices. Option a refers to emigration and immigration, which is unrelated to the demographic transition. Option b refers to changes in causes of death, which is not the main focus of the demographic transition. Option c mentions increased birth and death rates, which is incorrect. Option d correctly describes the decline in birth rates, increased life expectancy, and ageing population.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand what ""snowballing"" refers to in the context of sampling. Snowball sampling is a technique where existing study subjects recruit future subjects from among their acquaintances. 

Next, I need to determine which category this falls under. Snowball sampling does not involve random selection, so it is not probability sampling. Instead, it is a type of non-probability sampling because the sample is not randomly chosen and depends on referrals.

Cluster sampling involves dividing the population into clusters and randomly selecting clusters, which is not the case here. Lastly, ""using the Christmas vacation constructively"" is not a valid sampling method.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand what Marx meant by 'class polarization.' Marx predicted that capitalism would lead to a growing divide between the bourgeoisie (owners of production) and the proletariat (working class), with wealth and power concentrating in the hands of the bourgeoisie.

Next, I need to evaluate the choices. Option a refers to divisions within each class, which is not what Marx emphasized. Option b aligns with Marx's idea of a growing gap between rich and poor, leading to class consciousness. Option c suggests the growth of middle classes, which contradicts Marx's prediction of polarization. Option d is unrelated and incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context and the choices step by step:

1. The term 'incorporation' in the context of the labour movement in the nineteenth century refers to the process of integrating or including certain groups or organizations into broader systems or structures.
2. Among the choices, the most relevant to the labour movement would involve the inclusion of working-class organizations or unions in political or decision-making processes.
3. The correct choice aligns with the idea of including working-class organizations in political bargaining and representation, as this was a key aspect of the labour movement during that time.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct sociological concept, let's analyze the question step by step:

1. The question describes immigrant children learning English and the duties of citizenship in public schools. This process involves adopting the language, norms, and values of the dominant culture in the United States.
2. Acculturation refers to the process by which individuals or groups adopt the cultural traits or social patterns of another group, often the dominant culture, while still retaining aspects of their original culture.
3. The other options do not fit as well: 
   - Collective behavior refers to spontaneous social actions by a group.
   - Social stratification refers to the hierarchical arrangement of individuals in society.
   - Social mobility refers to the movement of individuals or groups within a social hierarchy.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Wallerstein's concept of a ""world system"" refers to a socio-economic system that transcends national boundaries and is characterized by a global division of labor. This system includes core, periphery, and semi-periphery regions, which are interconnected through economic and political relationships.

2. Option a) ""a means of transporting money between different areas of a country"" is incorrect because Wallerstein's world system is not limited to a single country; it operates on a global scale.

3. Option b) ""an empire with a bureaucratic administration but no political centre"" is also incorrect because Wallerstein's world system is not an empire; it is a decentralized economic system with no single political center.

4. Option c) ""an awareness of risks and dangers that affect the environment as a whole"" is unrelated to Wallerstein's concept, as it pertains more to environmental or risk sociology rather than the world system theory.

5. Option d) ""a unit with a division of labour that extends across ethnic and cultural groups"" aligns with Wallerstein's definition of a world system, as it emphasizes the global division of labor and the interconnectedness of different regions and cultures.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to recall Foucault's analysis of carceral organizations, particularly in his work ""Discipline and Punish."" Foucault discusses how carceral systems function to control and discipline individuals.

Next, I consider the key features of carceral organizations as described by Foucault. He emphasizes the role of surveillance, discipline, and the stripping of individuality to create docile bodies.

Finally, I evaluate the options. While options a) and b) do not align with Foucault's focus on discipline and control, option c) is partially correct but does not fully capture the essence of his argument. Option d) aligns most closely with Foucault's emphasis on surveillance and isolation as tools of power.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which of the options is not recognized as a level of society, let's analyze each step:

1. The household is a fundamental unit of society, often considered a basic level of social organization. It is recognized as a level of society.
2. The office is a workplace or organizational unit, but it is not typically recognized as a level of society. It is more of a functional or professional space rather than a societal level.
3. The global village refers to the interconnectedness of the world due to globalization and communication technologies. It is recognized as a societal level in a broader sense.
4. The nation-state is a political and social organization level, widely recognized as a level of society.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) refers to objective categories of ethnicity used in the census. However, ethnic identity is more subjective and personal, not just about census categories.
2. Option b) describes a felt sense of group membership based on religion, language, or history. This aligns with the subjective and personal nature of ethnic identity.
3. Option c) refers to the imposition of a racial label, which is more about external labeling rather than an individual's sense of identity.
4. Option d) refers to the fragmented and pluralistic nature of ethnicity, which does not directly define ethnic identity.

The most accurate definition of ethnic identity is option b). 

{'sol': 'b'}"
"First, I need to evaluate each option to determine if it contributes to the decline in marriage.  
Option a states that the proportion of people living alone has fallen to 29%, which does not directly indicate a decline in marriage.  
Option b mentions that many people are cohabiting in long-term relationships, which could be a reason for the decline in marriage as people may choose cohabitation over marriage.  
Option c suggests that the upward curve of remarriages compensates for the drop in first marriages, which does not directly support the idea of a decline in marriage.  
Option d states ""all of the above,"" but since not all options directly support the decline in marriage, this cannot be correct.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The market model of state welfare emphasizes the role of the market in providing welfare, often involving private purchase of welfare services with limited state intervention. This aligns with the idea of individuals buying welfare privately, with some means-tested benefits, as described in option a.

2. Option b refers to a traditional model of welfare based on gender roles, where men are seen as the primary earners. This does not align with the market model, which focuses on market mechanisms rather than gendered welfare distribution.

3. Option c describes a universalist system of welfare, which is not characteristic of the market model. Universalist systems are more aligned with social democratic or welfare state models, not market-based approaches.

4. Option d refers to decommodifying welfare, which means reducing reliance on the market by providing welfare through the state. This is contrary to the market model, which emphasizes market mechanisms rather than state provision.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) refers to the critical deconstruction of 'poverty' by feminist theorists. While feminist theorists may analyze poverty, this does not define the term ""feminization of poverty,"" which is more about the social and economic realities faced by women.

2. Option b) refers to women's increased chances of being in poverty due to low pay and greater welfare dependency. This aligns with the concept of the feminization of poverty, which highlights how women are disproportionately affected by poverty due to systemic inequalities, such as wage gaps and caregiving responsibilities.

3. Option c) refers to managing a budget and avoiding poverty being a woman's responsibility within the home. While this may be a related issue, it does not capture the broader societal and economic trends that the term ""feminization of poverty"" addresses.

4. Option d) refers to the disproportionate number of female sociologists researching poverty. This is unrelated to the concept of the feminization of poverty, which focuses on the lived experiences of women in poverty.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze each option to determine if it represents a recognized form of community.  
Option a) refers to ethnic communities, which are well-documented as communities based on shared identity and experiences.  
Option b) refers to gay villages, which are recognized as communities formed in urban areas.  
Option c) refers to sociological communities formed by unpopular lecturers, which does not align with recognized forms of community.  
Option d) refers to virtual communities, which are widely acknowledged as communities existing in cyberspace.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand what 'indentured labour' refers to. Indentured labour in the nineteenth century involved a system where individuals agreed to work for a specific employer for a fixed period, often in exchange for passage to a new country or to pay off debts.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) describes people being transported to British colonies and forced to work under poor conditions, which aligns with the concept of indentured labour. Option b) refers to the Atlantic slave trade, which is not the same as indentured labour. Option c) talks about skilled workers promoting companies overseas, which is unrelated to indentured labour. Option d) is clearly incorrect and not historically accurate.

Finally, the correct answer is option a), as it accurately describes the system of indentured labour in the nineteenth century. 

{'sol': 'a'}"
"First, I need to analyze each option to determine if it is part of cultural restructuring.  
a) Regenerating cities in economic decline is a common aspect of cultural restructuring, as it involves revitalizing urban areas.  
b) Turning industrial landscapes into tourist attractions is also part of cultural restructuring, as it repurposes spaces for cultural and economic use.  
c) Selling sites and images through the 'symbolic economy' of media advertising is another aspect, as it involves promoting cultural assets for economic gain.  
Since all three options are valid components of cultural restructuring, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to recall Weber's ideal type of bureaucracy, which includes characteristics such as a clear hierarchy of officials, impersonal rules, and extensive paperwork to ensure efficiency and predictability. 

Next, I need to evaluate the options. ""Impersonal rules"" and ""hierarchy of officials"" are explicitly part of Weber's model. ""Extensive paperwork"" aligns with the emphasis on documentation and record-keeping in bureaucracy. 

Finally, ""Salaries"" are not a defining characteristic of Weber's ideal type of bureaucracy, as his focus was more on structural and procedural elements rather than compensation.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the most important agent of socialization in early childhood, I will consider the following steps:

1. Socialization in early childhood primarily involves learning basic norms, values, and behaviors. The primary influence during this stage is typically the immediate environment and caregivers.
2. Among the options, the family is the first and most direct influence on a child, providing emotional support, teaching language, and instilling cultural norms and values.
3. While preschool providers, peer groups, and mass media also play roles in socialization, their influence becomes more significant as the child grows older. In early childhood, the family remains the most critical agent.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which of the options is not a 'research purpose,' I will analyze each choice step by step:

1. **Triangulation**: This refers to using multiple methods or data sources in research to enhance the reliability and validity of findings. It is a research strategy rather than a purpose.

2. **Explanation**: This is a common research purpose, aiming to clarify why phenomena occur or to establish cause-and-effect relationships.

3. **Description**: This is another research purpose, focusing on detailing and documenting characteristics of a phenomenon or population.

4. **Exploration**: This is also a research purpose, aiming to investigate new or poorly understood phenomena.

Since triangulation is a strategy and not a purpose, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the context of the nineteenth century and the scientific understanding of race during that time. 

Next, I know that genetics as a field of study was not developed until the early 20th century, with Gregor Mendel's work being rediscovered around 1900. Therefore, genetics would not have been a concept used to explain race in the 19th century.

On the other hand, ideas like evolution (Darwin's theory), height, and brain size were topics of interest and were often misused to justify racial theories during that time.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to identify which surveys are regularly conducted by the British government. The Labour Force Survey, General Household Survey, and Family Expenditure Survey are well-known national surveys conducted to gather data on employment, household characteristics, and family spending, respectively.

Next, I need to evaluate the ""Fashion Sensibility Survey."" This does not appear to be a regular or official survey conducted by the British government, as it does not align with the typical focus areas of national surveys.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall Blauner's (1964) theory of alienation, which examines how different industries and work practices affect workers' sense of control, meaning, and connection to their work.  
Next, Blauner argued that alienation is highest in industries where workers have little control over their tasks and are disconnected from the production process.  
Finally, among the options, car manufacturing in assembly plants is known for its repetitive, highly controlled, and fragmented tasks, which Blauner identified as the most alienating.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the concept of a 'decentralized city.' It refers to the movement of employment, services, and population away from a central urban area to multiple centers, often in smaller towns or rural areas. This aligns with option a.

Next, I consider whether the degendering of public space (option b) is a characteristic of a decentralized city. While this may occur in some cases, it is not a defining feature of decentralization.

Then, I evaluate gentrification (option c). Gentrification typically involves the movement of middle-class people back into the inner city, which is contrary to the idea of decentralization.

Finally, since only option a aligns with the concept of a decentralized city, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to recall Lombroso's main theory. Lombroso is known for his theory of the ""born criminal,"" which suggests that criminal behavior is biologically determined.  
Next, I need to identify which choice aligns with this theory. The idea that ""biological failings drove some people into crime"" directly reflects Lombroso's belief in biological determinism.  
Finally, I can conclude that the correct answer is the one that matches Lombroso's claim about biological factors influencing criminal behavior.  

{'sol': 'c'}"
"First, I need to analyze the context of Warner and Myrdal's claim. They were discussing the challenges faced by black former slaves in integrating into North American society.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a suggests that the white population did not believe in liberty, equality, and democracy, but this is not directly related to Warner and Myrdal's argument. Option b suggests that black former slaves wanted to retain their original ethnic identity, but this does not align with the historical context of their forced migration and struggle for equality. Option c suggests that they were not prepared to leave the Southern states, but this does not address the systemic barriers they faced in the North. Option d highlights the contradiction between the promise of citizenship and continued discrimination, which aligns with Warner and Myrdal's argument about systemic racism and exclusion.

Finally, I conclude that the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of ""reality is socially constructed"" as explained by Berger and Luckmann. They argue that reality is created through social interactions and shared understandings, meaning that people collectively define and maintain their social world.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) focuses on scientists and their work, which is not the central idea of Berger and Luckmann's argument. Option c) suggests sociologists define reality, which is not accurate as Berger and Luckmann emphasize collective social processes. Option d) dismisses the concept of reality as merely discourse, which does not align with their perspective.

Finally, option b) aligns with their argument, as it highlights how people negotiate shared definitions of their situation and live according to these, often forgetting that these definitions are socially constructed and not fixed.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which group or organization has the characteristics of a bureaucracy, I need to consider the defining features of a bureaucracy. Bureaucracies are typically characterized by a hierarchical structure, formal rules and procedures, division of labor, and impersonal relationships.

1. An extended or consanguine family does not fit the characteristics of a bureaucracy because it is based on personal relationships and kinship rather than formal rules or hierarchy.
2. The government of a large city fits the characteristics of a bureaucracy because it operates with a hierarchical structure, formal rules, division of labor, and impersonal relationships.
3. A book club where members take turns leading discussions does not fit the characteristics of a bureaucracy because it lacks a formal hierarchy and structured rules.
4. Volunteers who gather annually to clean the neighborhood do not fit the characteristics of a bureaucracy because their organization is informal and lacks a structured hierarchy or division of labor.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the context of Pilcher's identification of soap operas as a 'feminine genre.' This likely relates to how soap operas portray women and their roles in society.  
Next, I analyze the options. Option a) focuses on the characters being women, but this alone does not explain why soap operas are considered a 'feminine genre.' Option b) highlights the representation of women as both domesticated and independent, which aligns with the dual roles often depicted in soap operas. Option c) suggests alienation of women, which contradicts the idea of soap operas being a 'feminine genre.' Option d) mentions female producers, but this is not directly relevant to the genre's identification.  
Finally, I conclude that the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall Townsend's (1979) indicators of relative deprivation, which focus on material and social conditions that reflect poverty or lack of resources.  
Next, I need to evaluate each option to determine which one does not align with Townsend's framework.  
Option c) ""buying fewer than twenty DVDs in the previous year"" stands out as it refers to a modern consumer item and is not relevant to Townsend's 1979 study.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the type of social sanction applied in this instance, I will analyze the situation step by step:

1. The behavior in question is thumb-sucking, which is being met with teasing and ridicule. Teasing and ridicule are forms of disapproval or punishment, so this is a negative sanction.
2. Next, I need to determine whether the sanction is formal or informal. Formal sanctions are typically imposed by institutions or authorities (e.g., schools, governments), while informal sanctions come from peers, family, or society in general. In this case, the teasing and ridicule come from peers, making it an informal sanction.
3. Combining these observations, the sanction is an informal negative sanction.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) refers to cultural products like novels or paintings reflecting political ideologies. While this is related to culture and politics, it does not define the concept of political culture, which is more about shared beliefs and orientations toward politics within a society.

2. Option b) describes the basic beliefs and orientations toward politics that are widely shared by members of a culture. This aligns with the definition of political culture, which encompasses the collective attitudes, values, and norms about politics and governance in a society.

3. Option c) focuses on political beliefs and attitudes shared by people in public offices. This is more specific to political elites or officials, not the broader societal concept of political culture.

4. Option d) mentions ideological biases of the mass media. While media can influence political culture, this option does not define the concept itself.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze the options. Transnational corporations are companies that operate in multiple countries. Multi-media empires are large companies that own and operate across various media platforms. Ownership concentrated within one medium refers to companies focused on a single type of media. Government-owned companies are owned and operated by the government.

Next, I consider the examples given: Walt Disney, Sony, and Time Warner. These companies are known for their operations across multiple media platforms, such as film, television, music, and more, making them multi-media empires.

Finally, I confirm that the best fit for these companies is ""multi-media empires.""

{'sol': 'b'}"
"First, I need to understand what equilibrium theories of social change focus on. These theories generally emphasize maintaining balance and stability within society while addressing changes. 

Next, I analyze the options:
a) Globalization refers to the interconnectedness of the world, which is not directly related to equilibrium theories.
b) Stability and the structure of society align with the focus of equilibrium theories, as they emphasize maintaining societal balance.
c) Secularism and mechanization are specific aspects of societal change but do not directly relate to equilibrium theories.
d) Industrialization is a process of societal change but does not emphasize equilibrium or stability.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze the options to determine which one aligns with the definition of poverty used by the U.S. government.  
The U.S. government defines poverty using the ""poverty line,"" which was originally set in the 1960s based on the cost of a minimum food diet and has since been adjusted for inflation.  
Option a) aligns with this definition, as it specifies the poverty line's origin and adjustment for inflation.  
Option b) is incorrect because the poverty line does not include the value of government services like Medicaid or public housing.  
Option c) is incorrect because the U.S. poverty line is not based on relative deprivation or changes in income distribution.  
Option d) is incorrect because the poverty line does not vary based on individual lifestyle or needs.  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The 'absolute' poverty line refers to a fixed threshold that defines the minimum level of income or resources necessary for basic subsistence, such as food, shelter, and clothing. This is a universal measure and does not depend on societal norms or cultural values.

2. Option a) refers to the most extreme level of poverty in a society, but this does not align with the concept of the 'absolute' poverty line, which is a fixed measure rather than a description of extremity.

3. Option b) aligns with the definition of the 'absolute' poverty line, as it specifies the minimum level of income needed for basic subsistence.

4. Option c) describes 'relative' poverty, which is based on societal norms and values, not 'absolute' poverty.

5. Option d) refers to geographic areas of poverty concentration, which is unrelated to the concept of the 'absolute' poverty line.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand what 'eyeballing' refers to in the context of techniques. It generally means making a quick visual assessment or estimation without detailed analysis.  
Next, I will evaluate the options:  
a) Reading a textual document quickly to understand the gist of it is more aligned with 'skimming' or 'speed reading,' not 'eyeballing.'  
b) Gathering a sample from whoever you can see in a public place does not align with the concept of 'eyeballing.'  
c) Scanning a table to identify general patterns and significant figures fits the idea of making a quick visual assessment, which is consistent with 'eyeballing.'  
d) Keeping your eyes on research participants at all times is more about observation, not 'eyeballing.'  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which strategy was not used by the Conservative government of 1979 to reduce the power of the labour movement, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a: Making all strike action illegal**  
   The Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher did not make all strike action illegal. Instead, they focused on regulating and restricting certain types of strikes, but not banning all strike action outright. This option seems likely to be the correct answer.

2. **Option b: Imposing restrictions on picketing**  
   The government did impose restrictions on picketing, such as limiting the number of picketers and ensuring that picketing was peaceful and at the worker's own place of work. This was indeed a strategy used.

3. **Option c: Banning political strikes that were not primarily concerned with the worker's own conditions of work**  
   The government did take measures to limit political strikes, focusing on ensuring that strikes were directly related to workers' employment conditions. This was a strategy used.

4. **Option d: Making secondary action (in support of workers elsewhere) illegal**  
   Secondary action, also known as sympathy strikes, was made illegal under the Conservative government. This was another strategy used.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that was not used is making all strike action illegal. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the historical context of the nineteenth century. During this time, homosexuality was not widely accepted and was often pathologized or criminalized. 

Next, I need to evaluate the choices. Option a suggests a positive identity, but this is unlikely for the nineteenth century, as homosexuality was not seen in a positive light during this period. Option b suggests an absolute taboo, but while homosexuality was stigmatized, it did not necessarily mean all homosexuals were completely isolated. Option d suggests confirmation of the two-sex model, but homosexuality was more often seen as a deviation from societal norms rather than a confirmation of gender binaries.

Finally, option c suggests a subordinate form of masculinity that threatened 'compulsory heterosexuality.' This aligns with the historical understanding of homosexuality in the nineteenth century, as it was often viewed as a challenge to traditional gender roles and heterosexual norms.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the shape of the population pyramid, I need to consider the implications of a slightly larger birth rate than death rate over several generations.

1. A slightly larger birth rate than death rate means the population is growing, but not explosively. This suggests that younger age groups will be larger than older age groups.
2. A population pyramid with a wider base than the top indicates a growing population, as there are more young people than older people.
3. The other options (wider at the top, bulging in the middle, or parallel sides) do not align with the description of a population with a slightly larger birth rate than death rate.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of 'new racism.' It generally refers to a form of racism that is less overt and more subtle compared to traditional forms of racism. 

Next, I analyze the options. Option a) suggests a subtler form of prejudice masked by nationalist pride, which aligns with the idea of 'new racism' being less explicit and often tied to cultural or nationalistic justifications. Option b) refers to a post-modern deconstruction, which doesn't align with the concept of 'new racism.' Option c) mentions racism in new areas like cyberspace, which is not the primary focus of 'new racism.' Option d) describes an anti-fascist movement, which is unrelated to the concept of 'new racism.'

Finally, based on the analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. Giselle has been in middle management for ten years and has seen junior male colleagues promoted over her. This suggests that there may be a systemic barrier preventing her from advancing further in her career.

2. The term ""glass ceiling"" refers to an invisible barrier that prevents women and minorities from advancing to higher levels of leadership or management, despite their qualifications and achievements. This aligns with Giselle's situation.

3. The other options do not fit as well:
   - ""Gender constancy"" refers to a psychological concept about understanding one's gender identity, not workplace promotion barriers.
   - ""Underemployment"" refers to being employed in a position that does not fully utilize one's skills or education, which is not the focus here.
   - ""Glass elevator"" refers to the phenomenon where men in female-dominated professions are promoted more quickly than women, which is not the case here.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The Mafia is a structured group involved in illegal activities such as extortion, drug trafficking, and money laundering. This aligns with the concept of organized crime, which refers to groups systematically engaging in criminal enterprises.

2. White-collar crime typically involves non-violent crimes committed by individuals in professional settings, such as fraud or embezzlement. This does not describe the Mafia's activities.

3. Non-criminal deviance refers to behaviors that violate social norms but are not illegal. The Mafia's activities are illegal, so this option does not apply.

4. Global terrorism involves acts of violence intended to instill fear for political or ideological purposes. The Mafia's primary focus is profit-driven crime, not terrorism.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall Goldthorpe's concept of the 'service class.' Goldthorpe identified this class as a group of individuals in non-manual occupations who typically hold positions of authority and decision-making, often on behalf of the state or large organizations. 

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) aligns with this definition, as it refers to those in non-manual occupations exercising authority on behalf of the state. Option b) refers to consultancy firms, which is not specific to Goldthorpe's definition. Option c) refers to domestic service in the nineteenth century, which is unrelated to the 'service class.' Option d) refers to the armed services, which is also not relevant to Goldthorpe's concept.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a)** Increasing numbers of women in high-status positions: This is not characteristic of industrial production in the nineteenth century. While women did enter the workforce in larger numbers during this period, they were typically employed in low-status, low-paying jobs, such as in textile factories or domestic service.

2. **Option b)** Cottage industries and homeworkers doing piecework in the domestic sphere: This describes pre-industrial production methods, not the industrial production of the nineteenth century. The industrial revolution marked a shift away from cottage industries to factory-based production.

3. **Option c)** The 'managerial revolution' by which ownership and control became separate: While this concept became more prominent in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it is not the defining characteristic of industrial production during the nineteenth century.

4. **Option d)** Power-driven machinery and the concentration of workers in large workplaces: This is the hallmark of industrial production in the nineteenth century. The industrial revolution introduced power-driven machinery (e.g., steam engines) and centralized production in factories, leading to the concentration of workers in large workplaces.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the term 'collective consumption' as introduced by Castells in 1977. It refers to the consumption of goods and services that are provided collectively, typically by the state, for the benefit of society as a whole. 

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) refers to privatization, which is the opposite of collective provision. Option b) is about shopping in groups, which is unrelated to state-provided services. Option c) is a humorous but incorrect interpretation. Option d) correctly identifies the provision of essential services like health, housing, and education by the state.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze the historical context and terminology:

1. The deviant subculture of homosexuals in seventeenth and eighteenth-century London was known for their secretive gatherings and unique cultural practices.
2. Historical records and studies of this period often refer to this group as the ""mollies,"" a term used to describe effeminate men and homosexuals during that time.
3. The term ""mollies"" is the most historically accurate and widely recognized term for this subculture.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. A ""family of orientation"" refers to the family into which a person is born or raised, typically consisting of parents and siblings. This does not apply here because the question refers to Robert and Tanya's family unit, which includes their children.

2. A ""nuclear family"" consists of two parents and their children living together as a single household. This matches the description of Robert and Tanya's family, as they live with their three children.

3. An ""extended family"" includes relatives beyond the nuclear family, such as grandparents, aunts, uncles, or cousins, living together or maintaining close relationships. This is not mentioned in the question.

4. A ""communal family"" refers to a group of people who live together and share responsibilities, often not limited to biological or legal family ties. This does not apply to the scenario described.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall Durkheim's concept of 'collective representations.' This term refers to the shared beliefs, ideas, and moral values of a society that are often symbolized by objects, figures, or rituals.

Next, I need to evaluate the choices:
a) Effervescent ceremonies refer to moments of collective emotional energy but do not fully capture the idea of shared beliefs and values.
b) Images of gods or totems are examples of collective representations but do not encompass the broader concept of shared ideas and moral values.
c) Shared ideas and moral values, often symbolized by an object or figurehead, accurately describes the concept of collective representations.
d) Ideological tools used to obscure class divisions align more with Marxist theory than Durkheim's work.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which characteristic is not associated with totalitarian societies, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Indoctrination and propaganda**: Totalitarian societies often use indoctrination and propaganda to control public opinion and maintain power. This is a characteristic of totalitarianism.

2. **Freedom of movement for citizens**: Totalitarian regimes typically restrict the freedom of movement for their citizens to maintain control and prevent dissent. Therefore, freedom of movement is not a characteristic of totalitarian societies.

3. **One-party rule**: Totalitarian societies are usually governed by a single political party that holds all power. This is a characteristic of totalitarianism.

4. **A centrally planned economy**: Totalitarian regimes often implement centrally planned economies to control resources and production. This is a characteristic of totalitarianism.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall Freud's theory of the psyche, which includes the id, ego, and superego. The id represents instinctive drives, the superego represents moral standards, and the ego mediates between them.

Next, I need to identify the role of the ego specifically. The ego is the conscious part of the mind that deals with reality, making rational decisions and regulating emotional drives in a practical way.

Finally, I compare this understanding with the options provided. The correct description of the ego aligns with option c.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify which theory emphasizes the maintenance of order and stability in society.  
Functionalism is a sociological theory that focuses on how different parts of society work together to maintain stability and order.  
Interactionism focuses on small-scale, everyday interactions between individuals rather than societal stability.  
Rational-choice theory examines decision-making processes based on cost-benefit analysis, not societal stability.  
Conflict theory emphasizes power struggles and inequality, not maintaining order and stability.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which of the options is a personal document with closed access, I will analyze each choice step by step:

1. A government 'white paper' is a public document intended to inform or propose policies, so it is not personal and does not have closed access.
2. Confidential medical records are personal documents that are protected by privacy laws and have restricted access, making them closed access.
3. A household account book is a personal document, but it is not necessarily closed access as it depends on the owner's discretion.
4. The shares register of a business is not a personal document and is often accessible to certain stakeholders, so it is not closed access.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall what the tripartite system was. It was an educational system in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland implemented after the 1944 Education Act. 

Next, I need to identify the purpose of the 11+ exam. It was used to determine which type of school a pupil would attend based on their academic ability.

Finally, I need to match the types of schools in the tripartite system. The system divided pupils into grammar schools (for academic students), technical schools (for technical skills), and secondary modern schools (for practical skills).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall Durkheim's definition of social facts. Social facts are external to the individual and exert a coercive power over them. They are ways of acting, thinking, and feeling that exist outside the individual but influence their behavior.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) aligns with Durkheim's definition, as it describes social facts as collective and social in origin. Option b) refers to the construction of knowledge, which is not specific to Durkheim's concept of social facts. Option c) focuses on data collection, which is not the essence of social facts. Option d) suggests ideas without a basis in the external world, which contradicts Durkheim's emphasis on the external and coercive nature of social facts.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The media-themes model focuses on the influence of recurring themes in media content and how they shape public perception. It does not emphasize selective interpretation by audiences, so option (a) is not correct.

2. While content analysis can be a method to study media themes, the media-themes model itself is not specifically about the methodology of identifying themes. Therefore, option (b) is not correct.

3. The media-themes model suggests that audiences are influenced by recurring themes in media, implying a more passive absorption of messages. This aligns with the idea in option (c).

4. Social interaction reinforcing ideas and images is more aligned with other theories, such as the two-step flow model, rather than the media-themes model. Thus, option (d) is not correct.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall Bowlby's maternal deprivation thesis, which focuses on the importance of a child's early attachment to their mother.  
Next, Bowlby argued that the lack of a secure attachment during early childhood could lead to negative consequences in physical, intellectual, and social development.  
Finally, I can identify that the correct answer aligns with the idea that early deprivation of maternal care has long-term effects on a child's well-being.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) suggests that war became possible due to the division of the world into rival overseas empires. This is partially true, as imperialism and colonial rivalries were significant factors in the nineteenth century.

2. Option b) states that industrialization provided better transport, technology, and administration. This is also true, as industrialization revolutionized warfare by introducing advanced weapons, railways for troop movement, and improved communication systems.

3. Option c) mentions intense economic, political, and military competition. This is accurate as well, as the nineteenth century saw heightened competition among nation-states for resources, markets, and global influence.

4. Option d) combines all the above factors. Since all the individual factors (a, b, and c) contributed to the possibility of war between nation-states in the nineteenth century, the correct answer is d) all of the above.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify the criteria of community as outlined by Fulcher & Scott. These typically include aspects such as a shared sense of identity and belonging, common activities and relationships, and collective action based on shared interests. 

Next, I need to evaluate the options provided. A fixed geographical location is not necessarily a criterion for community, as communities can exist without being tied to a specific physical place (e.g., online communities).

Finally, I conclude that the correct answer is the one that does not align with the criteria of community as described by Fulcher & Scott.

{'sol': 'c'}"
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context and options step by step:

1. The 'Great Migration' refers to the movement of African Americans from the rural Southern United States to urban areas in the North, including Chicago, seeking better economic opportunities and escaping racial segregation and violence in the South.
2. While Chicago became more ethnically diverse, African Americans often faced systemic racism, segregation, and discrimination in housing, employment, and social integration. They were often confined to specific neighborhoods, such as the South Side of Chicago, due to redlining and other discriminatory practices.
3. This historical context aligns most closely with the idea that most ethnic groups were integrated into mainstream society, but the black population remained in the city's ghettos.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) suggests that a document is authentic if it is sincere, accurate, and free from political bias. However, authenticity in Scott's context does not necessarily depend on the absence of bias or sincerity but rather on its origin and reliability.

2. Option b) states that a document is authentic if it is representative of similar documents that did not survive. While representativeness might be important for historical analysis, it does not define authenticity in Scott's framework.

3. Option c) claims that a document is authentic if it has both a literal and interpretable meaning. This is more about the interpretive nature of documents rather than their authenticity.

4. Option d) defines an authentic document as a 'sound' original or a reliable copy of known authorship. This aligns with Scott's definition, which emphasizes the reliability and traceable origin of a document.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze each option to determine which one is not a consequence of global tourism.  
a) Decreased rates of prostitution and sex tourism: Global tourism has often been linked to an increase, not a decrease, in prostitution and sex tourism in certain regions.  
b) Developing countries can depend on it as a crucial source of income: This is a well-documented consequence of global tourism, as many developing countries rely on tourism for economic growth.  
c) The exploitation of cheap, unregulated labour in poor countries: This is a known issue in the tourism industry, where workers in developing countries are often underpaid and lack proper labor protections.  
d) We have become more aware of 'other' societies and ways of living: Tourism has indeed contributed to cultural exchange and awareness of different societies.  

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze the policies and goals of Thatcher's government. Thatcher's government was known for promoting marketization and privatization, emphasizing individual freedom, choice, and responsibility, and reducing the role of the welfare state.

Next, I need to evaluate the option regarding generous financial benefits for single parents, students, and the unemployed. Thatcher's government was not focused on expanding financial benefits for these groups; instead, it aimed to reduce welfare dependency and encourage self-reliance.

Finally, I can conclude that the correct answer is the option that does not align with Thatcher's policies, which is generous financial benefits for single parents, students, and the unemployed.

{'sol': 'c'}"
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a**: ""Not being able to write comprehensive fieldnotes or record conversations"" is a practical limitation of covert observation but not necessarily an ethical problem. This option is incorrect.

2. **Option b**: ""Deceiving the respondents as to the reason for your presence"" is an ethical issue because covert observation involves not informing participants about the research, which raises concerns about consent and deception. This option is likely correct.

3. **Option c**: ""Observing people outside of their natural setting"" is not an ethical problem but rather a methodological issue. Covert observation typically aims to observe people in their natural setting. This option is incorrect.

4. **Option d**: ""Subjecting the participants to physical harm"" is a serious ethical issue, but it is not specific to covert participant observation. This option is less relevant to the question.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the embourgeoisement thesis. This thesis suggests that members of the working class, particularly the affluent working class, begin to adopt middle-class values, lifestyles, and consumption patterns. 

Next, I need to evaluate the options:
a) This refers to a shift in authority within capitalism but does not align with the embourgeoisement thesis.
b) This directly aligns with the idea of the working class adopting middle-class values and ways of life.
c) Deskilling due to technology is unrelated to the embourgeoisement thesis.
d) The fragmentation of class structure is a different sociological concept and not related to embourgeoisement.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: Industrial capitalism did indeed separate the middle-class home from the workplace, reinforcing traditional gender roles and limiting women's participation in the public sphere. This is a valid reason.

2. **Option b**: Women who enter paid employment have often been sidelined into specific fields, such as caregiving or teaching, which are traditionally seen as extensions of their domestic roles. This is another valid reason.

3. **Option c**: Women have faced challenges in succeeding in ""malestream"" politics, as it often requires them to navigate a male-dominated environment, sometimes at the expense of their perceived femininity. This is also a valid reason.

4. **Option d**: Since all the above reasons contribute to the exclusion of women from the public sphere, this option is correct.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze the question and the choices provided. The question asks why economic aid has largely failed to promote modernization in developing countries. 

Next, I will evaluate the choices:
a) This suggests that the lack of clearly defined projects is the reason, but this is not a primary reason for the failure of economic aid.
b) This suggests that the United Nations has not called on rich countries to provide aid, but this is not accurate as the UN has often advocated for aid.
c) This suggests that debt repayments with interest can exceed the aid received, which is a valid and widely recognized issue in economic aid.
d) This is identical to choice c, so it is likely a typographical error.

Finally, the most logical and accurate answer is c, as debt repayments with interest often outweigh the benefits of the aid received, leading to a failure in promoting modernization.

{'sol': 'c'}"
"To answer this question, I will analyze the options step by step:

1. The Chicago School of criminology primarily focuses on social disorganization and environmental factors that contribute to crime, such as urbanization and poverty. Terrorism, however, is often committed on a larger, global scale and is typically well-organized, which aligns with option (a).

2. Terrorism is often associated with political conflict, such as struggles between states and their citizens or ideological groups, which is not a primary focus of the Chicago School. This aligns with option (b).

3. Terrorism can have far-reaching effects on international relations, influencing global politics, security policies, and diplomatic relations. This is not a characteristic of the crimes studied by the Chicago School, aligning with option (c).

4. Since all three options (a, b, and c) are valid, the correct answer is (d) all of the above.

{'sol': 'd'}"
"First, I need to understand the human relations approach. This approach focuses on the well-being of employees and emphasizes the importance of interpersonal relationships, teamwork, communication, and employee satisfaction in the workplace. 

Next, I will evaluate the options:
a) Scrutinizing employees as they interacted with customers does not align with the human relations approach, as it focuses more on control rather than employee well-being.
b) Teamwork, communication, and employee satisfaction align with the principles of the human relations approach, as it emphasizes improving workplace relationships and employee morale.
c) Strict control and discipline contradict the human relations approach, which prioritizes employee satisfaction over rigid control.
d) Providing therapy and counseling in the workplace is not a primary focus of the human relations approach, though it may indirectly contribute to employee well-being.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to recall Domhoff's identified processes of decision-making in the USA. Domhoff is known for his work on power structures and decision-making, particularly focusing on how elites influence policies and governance.

Next, I need to identify which of the listed processes are part of Domhoff's framework. Domhoff typically discusses processes like the policy-formation process and the candidate-selection process as mechanisms through which elites maintain power. The ideology process is also a concept he addresses, as it relates to shaping public opinion and maintaining elite dominance.

Finally, the exploitation process does not align with Domhoff's specific terminology or framework for decision-making processes in the USA. It is more associated with Marxist theory rather than Domhoff's work.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
