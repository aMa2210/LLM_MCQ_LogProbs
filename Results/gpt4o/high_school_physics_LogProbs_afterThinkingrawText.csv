"To solve this, I will use the formula for the charge on a capacitor: \( Q = C \cdot V \), where \( Q \) is the charge, \( C \) is the capacitance, and \( V \) is the potential difference.

1. The capacitance \( C \) is given as 2 mF, which is \( 2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{F} \).
2. The potential difference \( V \) is given as 5 V.
3. Substituting these values into the formula:  
   \( Q = (2 \times 10^{-3}) \cdot 5 = 10 \times 10^{-3} = 0.01 \, \text{C} \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a: The electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod**  
   For a finite-length charged rod, at distances far from the rod, the electric field behaves like that of a point charge. The electric field of a point charge decreases as the inverse square of the distance (\(1/r^2\)).  
   So, this option satisfies the condition.

2. **Option b: The electric field produced by an infinitely long charged cylinder**  
   For an infinitely long charged cylinder, the electric field decreases as \(1/r\), where \(r\) is the radial distance from the cylinder. This is because the field depends on the linear charge density and the geometry of the cylinder.  
   This does not satisfy the \(1/r^2\) condition.

3. **Option c: The electric field produced by an infinite plane of charge**  
   For an infinite plane of charge, the electric field is constant and does not depend on the distance from the plane.  
   This does not satisfy the \(1/r^2\) condition.

4. **Option d: The magnetic field produced by an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire**  
   For an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire, the magnetic field decreases as \(1/r\), where \(r\) is the radial distance from the wire.  
   This does not satisfy the \(1/r^2\) condition.

Thus, the only option where the field decreases as the inverse square of the distance is **a**.

"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The problem states that the charge is distributed on the surface of a solid, metal object, and the distribution is not uniform. This means the charge density varies across the surface.

2. For a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor is zero, and the electric field just outside the surface is perpendicular to the surface. The magnitude of the electric field just outside the surface is related to the surface charge density at that point.

3. Specifically, the electric field just outside the surface of a conductor is given by \( E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} \), where \( \sigma \) is the surface charge density and \( \epsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. The speed of a wave on a string is given by \( v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} \), where \( T \) is the tension in the string and \( \mu \) is the linear mass density of the string. When the tension \( T \) increases, the wave speed \( v \) also increases.

2. The relationship between wave speed, frequency, and wavelength is \( v = f \lambda \), where \( f \) is the frequency and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength. Since the frequency \( f \) is constant (100 Hz), an increase in wave speed \( v \) will result in an increase in the wavelength \( \lambda \).

3. Therefore, when the tension in the string is increased, the wavelength of the standing waves will be greater than the original wavelength. This eliminates options a) and d), which suggest the wavelength decreases.

4. The correct reasoning is that the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, and the wave speed varies directly with the wavelength. This matches option c).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the situation. Two identical capacitors are connected in parallel. In a parallel configuration, the voltage across each capacitor is the same because they are connected to the same two points in the circuit.

Next, since the capacitors are identical, their capacitance values are the same by definition.

Finally, the charge stored on each capacitor depends on the capacitance and the voltage (Q = CV). Since the capacitance and voltage are the same for both capacitors, the charge stored on each capacitor must also be the same.

Therefore, all three quantities (I, II, and III) must be the same for both capacitors. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The object is released from rest, so its initial kinetic energy is zero. It has gravitational potential energy at the top of the incline due to its height.

2. As the object slides down the rough incline, friction acts on it. This friction converts some of the gravitational potential energy into thermal energy, reducing the amount of energy available to be converted into kinetic energy.

3. At the bottom of the incline, the object's kinetic energy will be less than its initial gravitational potential energy because some of the energy has been dissipated as thermal energy due to friction.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Understanding the forces involved**: The small block will slide off the larger block if the force of static friction between them is not sufficient to counteract the relative motion. The force of static friction is given by \( f_s = \mu_s N \), where \( \mu_s \) is the coefficient of static friction and \( N \) is the normal force. Here, \( N = mg \), where \( m \) is the mass of the small block.

2. **When is the small block most likely to slide off?** The small block is most likely to slide off when the acceleration of the system is at its maximum. For a spring-block oscillator, the maximum acceleration occurs at the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position (not at the equilibrium position). The maximum acceleration is given by \( a_{\text{max}} = \frac{kA}{M+m} \), where \( k \) is the spring constant, \( A \) is the amplitude, and \( M+m \) is the total mass of the system.

3. **Condition for no sliding**: For the small block to remain stationary relative to the larger block, the maximum force of static friction must be greater than or equal to the maximum force required to keep the small block in place. The maximum force required is \( F = ma_{\text{max}} = m \cdot \frac{kA}{M+m} \). The maximum static friction force is \( f_s = \mu_s mg \). Therefore, the condition for no sliding is:
   \[
   \mu_s mg \geq m \cdot \frac{kA}{M+m}
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   \mu_s \geq \frac{kA}{(M+m)g}
   \]

Thus, the small block is most likely to slide off at the maximum displacement, and the condition for no sliding is \( \mu_s > \frac{kA}{(M+m)g} \).

The correct answer is:

"To solve this, I will use the formula for the work required to charge a capacitor, which is given by:

\[ W = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \]

Step 1: Identify the given values.
- Capacitance \( C = 10 \, \mu F = 10 \times 10^{-6} \, F \)
- Potential difference \( V = 100 \, V \)

Step 2: Substitute the values into the formula.
\[
W = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 \times 10^{-6}) \times (100)^2
\]

Step 3: Perform the calculations.
- \( 100^2 = 10000 \)
- \( 10 \times 10^{-6} = 10^{-5} \)
- \( W = \frac{1}{2} \times 10^{-5} \times 10000 = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 = 0.05 \, J \)

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate the distance the box slides before coming to rest step by step:

1. The force of kinetic friction acting on the box is \( f_k = \mu m g \), where \( \mu \) is the coefficient of kinetic friction, \( m \) is the mass of the box, and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity.

2. The acceleration of the box due to friction is \( a = \frac{f_k}{m} = \mu g \). This acceleration is negative because it opposes the motion of the box.

3. Using the kinematic equation \( v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a d \), where \( v \) is the final velocity (0 when the box comes to rest), \( v_0 \) is the initial velocity, \( a \) is the acceleration, and \( d \) is the distance traveled, we solve for \( d \):
   \[
   0 = v_0^2 + 2(-\mu g)d
   \]
   \[
   d = \frac{v_0^2}{2\mu g}
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate the total flight time of the soccer ball step by step:

1. First, I need to determine the vertical component of the initial velocity. The vertical velocity is given by \( v_y = v \cdot \sin(\theta) \), where \( v = 10 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \theta = 30^\circ \). Using \( \sin(30^\circ) = 0.5 \), the vertical velocity is \( v_y = 10 \cdot 0.5 = 5 \, \text{m/s} \).

2. Next, I calculate the time it takes for the ball to reach its highest point. At the highest point, the vertical velocity becomes zero due to gravity. The time to reach the highest point is given by \( t_{\text{up}} = \frac{v_y}{g} \), where \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). Substituting \( v_y = 5 \, \text{m/s} \), we get \( t_{\text{up}} = \frac{5}{9.8} \approx 0.51 \, \text{s} \).

3. The total flight time is twice the time to reach the highest point because the motion is symmetric. Therefore, \( t_{\text{total}} = 2 \cdot t_{\text{up}} = 2 \cdot 0.51 \approx 1.02 \, \text{s} \).

Thus, the total flight time is approximately 1 second. The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Thermal equilibrium and average kinetic energy**: When both containers are in thermal equilibrium with the room, they are at the same temperature. The average kinetic energy of gas molecules depends only on the temperature, not the type of gas. Therefore, the average kinetic energy of hydrogen and nitrogen gases is the same, ruling out option (a).

2. **Force exerted on the container**: The force exerted by a gas on the walls of its container is related to the pressure, which depends on the number of molecules, temperature, and volume. Since the problem does not specify the number of molecules in each container, we cannot determine which gas exerts a greater force. This rules out option (b).

3. **Density of the gases**: The density of a gas is proportional to its molar mass at a given temperature and pressure. Hydrogen (H₂) has a much lower molar mass (2 g/mol) compared to nitrogen (N₂, 28 g/mol). Therefore, the density of hydrogen gas is less than that of nitrogen gas, making option (c) correct.

4. **Pressure comparison**: The pressures of the gases depend on the number of molecules in each container, which is not provided. Thus, option (d) is not correct.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I will analyze each option step by step to determine which one would NOT balance the see-saw.

1. **Option a**: Moving the boy to half his original distance from the fulcrum reduces his torque. Torque is proportional to the product of mass and distance from the fulcrum. If the boy moves closer, his torque decreases, which could balance the see-saw. This is a possible method.

2. **Option b**: Moving the girl to double her original distance from the fulcrum increases her torque. Since torque is proportional to the product of mass and distance, doubling her distance would increase her torque, which could balance the see-saw. This is a possible method.

3. **Option c**: Allowing a second girl of mass m to join the first doubles the total mass on the girl's side. This increases the torque on her side, which could balance the see-saw. This is a possible method.

4. **Option d**: Moving the fulcrum to half its original distance from the boy changes the pivot point. This would increase the boy's torque (since the distance from the fulcrum to the boy increases) and decrease the girl's torque (since her distance from the fulcrum decreases). This would make the imbalance worse, not balance the see-saw. This is NOT a possible method.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the process of heat transfer at the molecular level. Heat transfer occurs when molecules of a substance with higher kinetic energy (hot water) collide with molecules of a substance with lower kinetic energy (cold alcohol).

Next, during these collisions, energy is transferred from the higher-energy molecules (hot water) to the lower-energy molecules (cold alcohol). This process continues until the average kinetic energy of the molecules in both substances becomes equal, resulting in thermal equilibrium.

Finally, the primary reason for the temperature equalization is the direct transfer of energy through molecular collisions, not through radiation or other mechanisms.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the torque applied to the sphere**: Torque (\( \tau \)) is given by the product of the friction force (\( F \)) and the radius (\( r \)) of the sphere. Here, \( \tau = F \cdot r = 2.0 \, \text{N} \cdot 0.30 \, \text{m} = 0.6 \, \text{N·m} \).

2. **Relate torque to angular acceleration**: Torque is also related to angular acceleration (\( \alpha \)) by the equation \( \tau = I \cdot \alpha \), where \( I \) is the moment of inertia. Solving for \( \alpha \), we get \( \alpha = \tau / I = 0.6 \, \text{N·m} / 0.06 \, \text{kg·m}^2 = 10 \, \text{rad/s}^2 \).

3. **Determine the time to come to rest**: The angular acceleration is related to the change in angular velocity (\( \Delta \omega \)) and time (\( t \)) by the equation \( \alpha = \Delta \omega / t \). Rearranging for \( t \), we get \( t = \Delta \omega / \alpha \). The initial angular velocity is \( \omega_0 = 20 \, \text{rad/s} \), and the final angular velocity is \( \omega_f = 0 \, \text{rad/s} \). Thus, \( t = (20 \, \text{rad/s}) / (10 \, \text{rad/s}^2) = 2 \, \text{s} \).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I will use the formula for gravitational field strength, \( g = \frac{G \cdot M}{R^2} \), where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M \) is the mass of the planet, and \( R \) is the radius of the planet.

1. The gravitational field strength on Earth is approximately \( g_{\text{Earth}} = 10 \, \text{N/kg} \). For Mars, the mass is \( \frac{1}{10} \) of Earth's mass, and the radius is \( \frac{1}{2} \) of Earth's radius.
2. Substituting these values into the formula, the gravitational field strength on Mars becomes:
   \[
   g_{\text{Mars}} = g_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \frac{M_{\text{Mars}}}{M_{\text{Earth}}} \cdot \left(\frac{R_{\text{Earth}}}{R_{\text{Mars}}}\right)^2
   \]
   Substituting \( \frac{M_{\text{Mars}}}{M_{\text{Earth}}} = \frac{1}{10} \) and \( \frac{R_{\text{Earth}}}{R_{\text{Mars}}} = 2 \):
   \[
   g_{\text{Mars}} = 10 \cdot \frac{1}{10} \cdot 2^2 = 10 \cdot \frac{1}{10} \cdot 4 = 4 \, \text{N/kg}.
   \]
3. Therefore, the gravitational field strength at the surface of Mars is closest to 4 N/kg.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's proceed step by step:

1. **Understand the electric field due to an infinite plane of charge**: The electric field produced by an infinite plane of charge with surface charge density \( \sigma \) is given by \( E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \) on either side of the plane. The direction of the field depends on the sign of the charge density \( \sigma \). For a positively charged plane, the field points away from the plane, and for a negatively charged plane, it points toward the plane.

2. **Given information**: The problem states that above the plane, the electric field is \( \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \) and points upward. This implies that the plane is positively charged because the field points away from the plane.

3. **Determine the field below the plane**: Below the plane, the electric field will also have a magnitude of \( \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \), but it will point downward because the field lines for a positively charged plane point away from the plane on both sides.

Thus, the magnitude of the electric field below the plane is \( \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \), and the direction is downward.

The correct answer is **a) \( \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \), down**.

"To solve this, I will use the formula for the radius of the circular motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field: \( r = \frac{mv}{qB} \), where \( m \) is the mass of the electron, \( v \) is its velocity, \( q \) is the charge of the electron, and \( B \) is the magnetic field strength.

1. The mass of an electron is \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \), the charge of an electron is \( q = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), the velocity is \( v = 10^7 \, \text{m/s} \), and the magnetic field is \( B = 5 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T} \).

2. Substituting these values into the formula:
   \[
   r = \frac{(9.11 \times 10^{-31}) (10^7)}{(1.6 \times 10^{-19}) (5 \times 10^{-5})}
   \]

3. Simplify the numerator and denominator:
   \[
   r = \frac{9.11 \times 10^{-24}}{8 \times 10^{-24}} = 1.14 \, \text{m}.

Thus, the radius of the circle is approximately 1 meter.

"First, I need to understand that in the case of a plane mirror, the distance of the image from the mirror is equal to the distance of the object from the mirror. 

Next, since the object is placed 100 cm from the mirror, the image will also be 100 cm behind the mirror.

Finally, the total distance between the object and its image is the sum of the distance of the object from the mirror and the distance of the image from the mirror: 100 cm + 100 cm = 200 cm.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the forces step by step:

1. The horse pushes backward on the ground with its hooves. According to Newton's third law, the ground exerts an equal and opposite forward static friction force on the horse. This forward static friction force is what allows the horse to move forward.

2. The horse is attached to the cart, so as the horse moves forward, it pulls the cart along. The cart experiences a backward friction force, but as long as the forward static friction force on the horse is greater than the backward friction forces acting on the cart, the entire horse-cart system can accelerate forward.

3. The other options involve misunderstandings of forces. For example, the upward normal force and the horse's weight balance each other vertically, so they do not contribute to horizontal acceleration. Similarly, the forward force of the horse on the cart and the backward force of the cart on the horse are equal and opposite (Newton's third law), so they do not explain the system's acceleration.

Thus, the correct explanation is that the forward static friction force of the ground on the horse is greater than any backward friction forces acting on the cart, allowing the system to accelerate forward.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate the potential difference using the relationship between electric field and potential difference. The potential difference \( V \) is given by the integral of the electric field over the distance:

1. The electric field is given as \( E_r = -6r^2 + 4r + 3 \). The potential difference \( V \) is calculated as:
   \[
   V = -\int E_r \, dr
   \]

2. The point (3, 4) lies at a distance \( r = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5 \, \text{m} \) from the origin. So, we need to integrate \( E_r \) from \( r = 0 \) to \( r = 5 \).

3. Perform the integration:
   \[
   V = -\int_0^5 (-6r^2 + 4r + 3) \, dr
   \]
   Break it into parts:
   \[
   V = -\left[ \int_0^5 (-6r^2) \, dr + \int_0^5 (4r) \, dr + \int_0^5 (3) \, dr \right]
   \]

4. Compute each term:
   - For \( \int_0^5 (-6r^2) \, dr \):
     \[
     \int_0^5 (-6r^2) \, dr = -6 \cdot \frac{r^3}{3} \Big|_0^5 = -6 \cdot \frac{5^3}{3} = -6 \cdot \frac{125}{3} = -250
     \]
   - For \( \int_0^5 (4r) \, dr \):
     \[
     \int_0^5 (4r) \, dr = 4 \cdot \frac{r^2}{2} \Big|_0^5 = 4 \cdot \frac{5^2}{2} = 4 \cdot \frac{25}{2} = 50
     \]
   - For \( \int_0^5 (3) \, dr \):
     \[
     \int_0^5 (3) \, dr = 3r \Big|_0^5 = 3 \cdot 5 = 15

5. Add the results:
   \[
   V = -\left[ -250 + 50 + 15 \right] = -\left[ -185 \right] = 185 \, \text{V}

Next, if the resistance \( R \) is doubled, the new resistance becomes \( 2R \). Substituting this into the power formula, the new power becomes \( P' = \frac{V^2}{2R} \).

Finally, comparing the new power \( P' \) to the original power \( P \), we see that \( P' = \frac{1}{2}P \). This means the power is halved when the resistance is doubled.

"To determine which combination of mass and charge results in the largest radius of the circular path, we use the formula for the radius of the circular motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field:

\[ r = \frac{mv}{|q|B} \]

where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the circular path,
- \( m \) is the mass of the particle,
- \( v \) is the speed of the particle,
- \( q \) is the charge of the particle,
- \( B \) is the magnetic field strength.

Step 1: Since the speed \( v \) and magnetic field \( B \) are the same for all isotopes, the radius \( r \) is proportional to \( \frac{m}{|q|} \). Thus, we need to calculate \( \frac{m}{|q|} \) for each option.

Step 2: Compute \( \frac{m}{|q|} \) for each choice:
- a) \( m = 16 \, \text{u}, \, q = -5e \): \( \frac{m}{|q|} = \frac{16}{5} = 3.2 \)
- b) \( m = 17 \, \text{u}, \, q = -4e \): \( \frac{m}{|q|} = \frac{17}{4} = 4.25 \)
- c) \( m = 18 \, \text{u}, \, q = -3e \): \( \frac{m}{|q|} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- d) \( m = 20 \, \text{u}, \, q = -1e \): \( \frac{m}{|q|} = \frac{20}{1} = 20 \)

Step 3: The largest radius corresponds to the largest \( \frac{m}{|q|} \). From the calculations, the largest value is \( 20 \), which corresponds to option d).

"First, I need to understand that the electric field at the midpoint between the charges of an electric dipole is due to the superposition of the fields from both charges. Since the charges are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, their electric fields at the midpoint will cancel each other out.

Next, I calculate the electric field due to each charge at the midpoint. The formula for the electric field due to a point charge is \( E = k \cdot \frac{q}{r^2} \), where \( k = 9.0 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( q = 4.0 \, \text{nC} = 4.0 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{C} \), and \( r = 1.0 \, \text{cm} = 0.01 \, \text{m} \) (half the separation distance).

Substituting the values, \( E = 9.0 \times 10^9 \cdot \frac{4.0 \times 10^{-9}}{(0.01)^2} = 9.0 \times 10^9 \cdot \frac{4.0 \times 10^{-9}}{0.0001} = 3.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{N/C} \). However, the fields from the two charges are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, so they cancel each other out.

Therefore, the net electric field at the midpoint is zero. The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the difference between standing in cold air and being submerged in cold water. Water has a much higher density than air, meaning it has more molecules per unit volume.

Next, because water has more molecules per volume, it can transfer heat away from the body much more efficiently than air. This is due to the increased molecular contact with the person's body.

Finally, this increased heat transfer in water leads to a rapid loss of body heat, which can cause hypothermia and potentially death in a short amount of time. Therefore, the primary reason is related to the density of water compared to air.

"First, I need to use the principle of conservation of mass for incompressible fluids, which states that the flow rate (volume per unit time) remains constant throughout the pipe. The flow rate is given by the product of the cross-sectional area of the pipe and the flow speed.

Next, I calculate the cross-sectional area of the pipe at both points. The area of a circle is \( A = \pi r^2 \), where \( r \) is the radius. For the first point, the diameter is 2 cm, so the radius is 1 cm (0.01 m). The area is \( A_1 = \pi (0.01)^2 \). For the second point, the diameter is 3 cm, so the radius is 1.5 cm (0.015 m). The area is \( A_2 = \pi (0.015)^2 \).

Finally, I use the equation \( A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2 \), where \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \) are the flow speeds at the two points. Substituting the areas and solving for \( v_2 \), I find that \( v_2 = v_1 (A_1 / A_2) = 18 \times (0.01^2 / 0.015^2) = 18 \times (1 / 2.25) = 8 \, \text{m/s} \).

"To solve this, I will use the principle of conservation of mass for an ideal fluid, which states that the flow rate (volume per unit time) must remain constant throughout the system.

1. First, calculate the flow rate in the original pipe. The flow rate is given by the product of the cross-sectional area of the pipe and the flow speed. The cross-sectional area of the original pipe is \( A = \pi Q^2 \), so the flow rate is \( \text{Flow rate} = A \cdot V = \pi Q^2 \cdot V \).

2. Next, consider the three separate paths. Each path has a radius of \( Q/2 \), so the cross-sectional area of each path is \( A_{\text{path}} = \pi (Q/2)^2 = \pi Q^2 / 4 \). Since there are three paths, the total cross-sectional area of the three paths is \( 3 \cdot A_{\text{path}} = 3 \cdot (\pi Q^2 / 4) = 3\pi Q^2 / 4 \).

3. The flow rate must remain constant, so the total flow rate through the three paths is equal to the flow rate in the original pipe. Let the flow speed in each path be \( V_{\text{path}} \). The total flow rate through the three paths is \( 3 \cdot (A_{\text{path}} \cdot V_{\text{path}}) = 3 \cdot (\pi Q^2 / 4) \cdot V_{\text{path}} = 3\pi Q^2 V_{\text{path}} / 4 \). Setting this equal to the original flow rate, \( \pi Q^2 \cdot V \), we have:
   \[
   \frac{3\pi Q^2 V_{\text{path}}}{4} = \pi Q^2 V
   \]

4. Simplify the equation by canceling \( \pi Q^2 \) on both sides:
   \[
   \frac{3V_{\text{path}}}{4} = V
   \]

5. Solve for \( V_{\text{path}} \):
   \[
   V_{\text{path}} = \frac{4}{3}V
   \]

Thus, the flow speed through each of the paths is \( \frac{4}{3}V \).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the interaction between a positron (antimatter counterpart of the electron) and an electron. When a positron and an electron meet, they annihilate each other, converting their mass into energy in the form of gamma rays.

Next, I consider the conservation laws. Conservation of charge ensures that the total charge before and after the reaction remains zero (positron has +1 charge, electron has -1 charge). Conservation of momentum requires that the resulting gamma rays move in opposite directions to balance the initial momentum (since the positron is slow-moving and the electron is stationary, the system's initial momentum is nearly zero).

Finally, I evaluate the choices. Option c correctly describes the outcome: two gamma rays moving in opposite directions are created to conserve momentum. The other options are incorrect because:
- a) Misinterprets conservation of mass-energy.
- b) Misinterprets conservation of charge (gamma rays are neutral, but this doesn't explain the reaction).
- d) Incorrectly suggests the electron remains after annihilation.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the relationship between the normal force and the angle of the inclined plane. The normal force is the perpendicular force exerted by the surface of the inclined plane on the box. It is equal to the component of the gravitational force perpendicular to the plane.

Next, the gravitational force acting on the box is constant and equal to \(mg\), where \(m\) is the mass of the box and \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity. The normal force is given by \(N = mg \cos(\theta)\), where \(\theta\) is the angle of the inclined plane.

As the angle \(\theta\) increases, \(\cos(\theta)\) decreases nonlinearly (since the cosine function is not linear). Therefore, the normal force \(N\) decreases nonlinearly as the angle of the plane increases.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze the situation. The collision is elastic, so both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. The large cart initially has a velocity \( v \), and the small cart is at rest. After the collision, the large cart loses half of its kinetic energy to the small cart.

Step 1: Write the initial momentum and kinetic energy.  
The initial momentum is \( P_{\text{initial}} = 4m \cdot v \), and the initial kinetic energy is \( KE_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 4m \cdot v^2 = 2mv^2 \).

Step 2: After the collision, the large cart loses half its kinetic energy.  
The large cart's final kinetic energy is \( KE_{\text{large, final}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot KE_{\text{initial}} = mv^2 \).  
The small cart gains the other half of the kinetic energy, so \( KE_{\text{small, final}} = mv^2 \).

Step 3: Use the kinetic energy of the small cart to find its velocity.  
The kinetic energy of the small cart is \( KE_{\text{small, final}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot m \cdot v_{\text{small}}^2 \).  
Substitute \( KE_{\text{small, final}} = mv^2 \):  
\[
mv^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot m \cdot v_{\text{small}}^2
\]
Cancel \( m \) and solve for \( v_{\text{small}}^2 \):  
\[
v_{\text{small}}^2 = 2v^2
\]
Take the square root:  
\[
v_{\text{small}} = \sqrt{2}v \approx 1.41v
\]

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. Initially, the circuit is disconnected, so no current flows, and the net charge on the circuit elements remains unchanged. The battery has a separation of charges internally, but the overall net charge of the circuit is neutral.

2. When the circuit is connected, current begins to flow. Electrons move through the circuit, powering the light bulb. However, the flow of electrons does not create or destroy charge; it simply redistributes it within the circuit.

3. Since charge is conserved and no external charge is added or removed from the circuit, the net charge on the circuit elements remains the same as it was before the circuit was connected.

Thus, the net charge residing on the circuit elements has not changed.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider the role of gravity in the Moon's motion. Gravity is the force that keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth. Without gravity, there would be no centripetal force to maintain the Moon's orbit.

Next, I need to analyze what happens to the Moon's motion if gravity stops. Without the gravitational pull from the Earth, the Moon would no longer revolve around the Earth. Instead, it would move in a straight line due to inertia, as described by Newton's first law of motion.

Finally, I need to consider the Moon's rotation. The Moon's rotation on its axis is independent of the gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon. Therefore, the Moon would continue to rotate on its axis even if the gravitational force stopped.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I need to analyze the forces acting on the person in the elevator and how the motion of the elevator affects the scale reading.

1. The scale measures the normal force exerted on the person, which is affected by the apparent weight. The apparent weight is less than the actual weight when the elevator is accelerating downward because the net force is reduced by the downward acceleration.

2. If the elevator is moving downward and slowing down, it is accelerating upward. This would increase the apparent weight, not decrease it. So, option (a) is incorrect.

3. If the elevator is moving upward and slowing down, it is accelerating downward. This would reduce the apparent weight, which matches the observation. So, option (b) is a possible answer.

4. If the elevator is moving upward at a constant speed, there is no acceleration, and the apparent weight would equal the actual weight. This does not match the observation. So, option (c) is incorrect.

5. If the elevator is moving downward at a constant speed, there is no acceleration, and the apparent weight would equal the actual weight. This does not match the observation. So, option (d) is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement I**: The ball’s speed is zero at the highest point.  
   - At the highest point of its motion, the ball momentarily stops before reversing direction. This means its speed is indeed zero at the highest point.  
   - **Statement I is true.**

2. **Statement II**: The ball’s acceleration is zero at the highest point.  
   - Even at the highest point, the ball is still under the influence of gravity, which causes a constant downward acceleration. Air resistance does not cancel out gravity completely, so the acceleration is not zero.  
   - **Statement II is false.**

3. **Statement III**: The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.  
   - When air resistance is not negligible, it slows the ball down more on the way up than on the way down. This means the ball takes longer to reach the highest point than to fall back down.  
   - **Statement III is true.**

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the dimensions of impulse, let's proceed step by step:

1. Impulse is defined as the product of force and time. Mathematically, impulse = force × time.
2. The dimensions of force are derived from Newton's second law, \( F = ma \), where \( m \) is mass and \( a \) is acceleration. The dimensions of acceleration are \( L/T^2 \), so the dimensions of force are \( M \cdot L/T^2 \).
3. Now, multiplying the dimensions of force (\( M \cdot L/T^2 \)) by time (\( T \)), we get \( M \cdot L/T^2 \cdot T = M \cdot L/T \).

Thus, the dimensions of impulse are \( M \cdot L/T \).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I need to consider the effect of the magnetic field on the proton's motion. 

1. The magnetic force acts perpendicular to the velocity of the proton and does not do work on the proton. This means the magnetic field cannot change the speed (magnitude of velocity) of the proton, only its direction.

2. Since the proton's speed is determined by the magnitude of its velocity vector, and the magnetic field does not affect this magnitude, the proton's speed remains constant over time.

3. Therefore, the proton's speed 4 seconds after entering the magnetic field is the same as its initial speed, which is 1.5 × 10^6 m/s.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. The man's weight is the gravitational force acting on him due to the Earth. This force is directed downward and is equal to the product of his mass and the acceleration due to gravity (mg).

2. According to Newton's third law, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. The action-reaction pair to the man's weight is the force that the man exerts back on the Earth. This force is equal in magnitude to his weight but directed upward.

3. The other forces mentioned in the choices, such as the force of the elevator cable or the force of the man on the scale, are not directly related to the action-reaction pair of the man's weight. These forces are part of the system dynamics but not the specific pair we are analyzing.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's consider the first law of thermodynamics and the conditions of the process:

1. The first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy (\( \Delta U \)) of a system is equal to the heat (\( Q \)) added to the system minus the work (\( W \)) done by the system:  
   \[ \Delta U = Q - W \]

2. For an isothermal process involving an ideal gas, the temperature remains constant. Since the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature, \( \Delta U = 0 \).

3. Substituting \( \Delta U = 0 \) into the first law equation, we get:  
   \[ 0 = Q - W \]  
   Rearranging, \( Q = W \). This means that the heat added to the gas is equal to the work done by the gas.

4. The problem states that the gas does 150 J of work against its surroundings. Therefore, \( W = 150 \, \text{J} \). From the equation \( Q = W \), the heat transfer \( Q \) is also 150 J, and it is added to the gas.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to determine the charge of a single electron, which is approximately -1.6 × 10^-19 C.  
Next, I calculate the number of excess electrons by dividing the total charge of the object (-1 C) by the charge of a single electron (-1.6 × 10^-19 C).  
The calculation is: 1 ÷ 1.6 × 10^-19 = 6.25 × 10^18 electrons.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a**: Lightly touching the guitar string in the middle creates a node, but the length of the string is not the wavelength of the sound wave. The wavelength of the sound wave depends on the speed of sound in air and the frequency, not directly on the string's length. This option is incorrect.

2. **Option b**: The length of the guitar string is related to the wavelength of the standing wave on the string, not the wavelength of the sound wave in air. The sound wave's wavelength in air is determined by the speed of sound and the frequency, not the string's length. This option is also incorrect.

3. **Option c**: Adjusting the length of a pipe near the string to hear resonances is a practical method. Resonances occur when the length of the air column in the pipe matches specific fractions of the sound wave's wavelength. The difference in pipe lengths for consecutive resonances corresponds to half the wavelength of the sound wave. This option is correct.

4. **Option d**: Measuring the peak-to-peak distance of the wave as it passes is not practical for sound waves in air because sound waves are longitudinal, not transverse. The wavelength cannot be directly observed as a peak-to-peak distance. This option is incorrect.

The correct and practical method is described in **option c**.

"First, I need to analyze the properties of the different optical devices mentioned in the options. Concave lenses always produce virtual images, so option a is incorrect. Concave mirrors can produce both real and virtual images depending on the object's position relative to the focal point, so option b is incorrect. Convex lenses can produce both real and virtual images depending on the object's position relative to the focal point, so option c is correct. Convex mirrors always produce virtual images, so option d is incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider the forces acting on the object. Gravity would pull the object toward the center of the Earth as it falls. As the object passes the center, gravity would then act in the opposite direction, slowing it down.

Next, I need to account for the ideal conditions stated in the problem. Without air resistance or other forces, the object would continue to oscillate due to the conservation of energy. It would move back and forth between the two openings.

Finally, I conclude that the motion of the object would best be described by oscillating indefinitely between the two openings, as no energy is lost in this ideal scenario.

{'sol': 'c'}"
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. When the second block of equal mass falls on the oscillating block and they stick together, the total mass of the system doubles. The spring-block system's angular frequency depends on the mass and spring constant, given by \( \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). Doubling the mass will reduce the angular frequency, as \( \omega \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass.

2. The amplitude of oscillation is related to the energy of the system. The total mechanical energy of the system is proportional to the square of the amplitude, \( E \propto A^2 \). When the second block sticks to the first, the collision is inelastic, and some energy is lost. This energy loss will reduce the amplitude of the oscillations.

3. The exact effect on the amplitude depends on the phase of the oscillation (where the block is in its cycle) when the second block falls. For example, if the second block falls when the first block is at maximum displacement, the amplitude might be less affected compared to when it falls at maximum velocity.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine when there is no perceived Doppler shift, we need to analyze the relative motion between the source and the detector. The Doppler effect occurs when there is a relative velocity between the source and the detector along the line of sight. Let's evaluate each option step by step:

a) If the source travels toward the stationary detector, there is relative motion between the source and the detector. This will result in a perceived Doppler shift. So, this option does not satisfy the condition.

b) If the detector travels toward the stationary source, there is again relative motion between the source and the detector. This will also result in a perceived Doppler shift. So, this option does not satisfy the condition.

c) If both the source and detector travel in the same direction, the perceived Doppler shift depends on their relative velocities. If their velocities are equal (i.e., they are moving at the same speed in the same direction), there will be no relative motion between them, and thus no perceived Doppler shift. This option satisfies the condition if their velocities are equal.

d) If both the source and detector travel in opposite directions, with the source and detector moving away from each other, there is relative motion between them. This will result in a perceived Doppler shift. So, this option does not satisfy the condition.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I will use the principle of buoyancy and Archimedes' principle.

1. First, calculate the volume of the cube. The side length of the cube is 0.5 m, so the volume \( V \) is:
   \[
   V = (0.5)^3 = 0.125 \, \text{m}^3
   \]

2. Next, calculate the weight of the cube. The mass of the cube is 100 kg, so the weight \( W \) is:
   \[
   W = \text{mass} \times g = 100 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 980 \, \text{N}
   \]

3. The buoyant force acting on the cube is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the submerged portion of the cube. The density of the fluid is 1200 kg/m³, so the buoyant force \( F_b \) is:
   \[
   F_b = \text{density of fluid} \times g \times \text{volume submerged}
   \]

4. At equilibrium, the buoyant force equals the weight of the cube:
   \[
   F_b = W
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   1200 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \times V_{\text{submerged}} = 980 \, \text{N}
   \]

5. Solve for the submerged volume \( V_{\text{submerged}} \):
   \[
   V_{\text{submerged}} = \frac{980}{1200 \times 9.8} = \frac{1}{12} \, \text{m}^3
   \]

6. The fraction of the cube's volume that is submerged is:
   \[
   \text{Fraction submerged} = \frac{V_{\text{submerged}}}{V} = \frac{1/12}{0.125} = \frac{1}{9}
   \]

7. The fraction of the cube's volume that floats above the surface is:
   \[
   \text{Fraction above} = 1 - \text{Fraction submerged} = 1 - \frac{1}{9} = \frac{8}{9}
   \]

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze the forces acting on the person. The downward pull of gravity (weight) and the upward normal force are equal in magnitude when the person is stationary on a horizontal floor, as there is no net vertical motion.

Next, I need to determine if these forces form an action-reaction pair. Action-reaction pairs are forces that are equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and act on two different objects. Here, the gravitational force acts on the person due to the Earth, while the normal force acts on the person due to the floor. These forces do not act on two different objects, so they do not form an action-reaction pair.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Understand the motion of the particle in the electric field**: The particle experiences a force \( F = QE \) due to the electric field. This force causes an acceleration \( a = F/m = QE/m \). The distance \( d \) traveled by the particle is determined by the kinematic equation \( d = \frac{v^2}{2a} \), where \( v \) is the initial velocity and \( a \) is the acceleration.

2. **Substitute the expressions for \( a \) and \( d \)**: Using \( a = QE/m \), the distance becomes \( d = \frac{v^2}{2(QE/m)} = \frac{mv^2}{2QE} \).

3. **Analyze the new conditions**: If the velocity is doubled (\( v \to 2v \)) and the mass is halved (\( m \to m/2 \)), substitute these changes into the formula for \( d \):
   \[
   d' = \frac{(m/2)(2v)^2}{2QE} = \frac{(m/2)(4v^2)}{2QE} = \frac{2mv^2}{2QE} = 2d.
   \]

Thus, the particle travels twice the original distance. The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. In a linear, elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. These two conservation laws provide two equations that can be used to solve for unknowns.

2. The unknowns in this problem are the mass of the second object and the final velocities of the two objects after the collision. To determine the mass of the second object, we need enough information to solve the system of equations derived from the conservation laws.

3. If we know the initial speed of object 1 (b) and either the final speed of object 1 (a) or the final speed of object 2 (c), we can use the conservation equations to solve for the mass of the second object. However, knowing only one of these values (a, b, or c) is insufficient. Therefore, we need any two of the values (a, b, or c) to determine the mass of the second object.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. The photoelectric effect occurs when photons of light have enough energy to overcome the work function of a metal, ejecting electrons. The energy of a photon is given by \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the light.

2. The wavelength of the light in this case is 550 nm, which corresponds to visible light. If no photoelectrons are produced, it means the energy of the photons is less than the work function of the metal. Increasing the intensity of the light only increases the number of photons, not their energy.

3. Since the energy of individual photons is still insufficient to overcome the work function, no photoelectrons will be emitted, regardless of the intensity of the light.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will consider the principle of superposition and the conditions for constructive and destructive interference:

1. The resultant displacement of two waves is determined by the principle of superposition, which states that the displacements of the individual waves add algebraically.
2. For constructive interference (when the waves are in phase), the amplitudes add, giving a maximum displacement of \( 4 \, \text{cm} + 6 \, \text{cm} = 10 \, \text{cm} \).
3. For destructive interference (when the waves are out of phase), the amplitudes subtract, giving a minimum displacement of \( 6 \, \text{cm} - 4 \, \text{cm} = 2 \, \text{cm} \).
4. Therefore, the resultant displacement \( D \) can vary between \( 2 \, \text{cm} \) and \( 10 \, \text{cm} \), depending on the relative phase of the two waves.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each collision step by step:

1. **Collision A**: 
   - When two carts collide and bounce off each other, Newton's Third Law states that the force exerted by one cart on the other is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Therefore, the force experienced by each cart is the same.
   - The time of collision is the same for both carts because they are in contact for the same duration.
   - The change in linear momentum for each cart is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, as momentum is conserved in the system.
   - The change in kinetic energy is not necessarily the same for both carts because kinetic energy depends on the square of velocity, and the masses and velocities of the carts may differ.

2. **Collision B**:
   - When the ball sticks to the rod and the system begins to rotate, the torque experienced by the ball and the rod is the same because they are part of the same rigid system.
   - The time of collision is the same for both the ball and the rod because they interact during the same event.
   - The change in angular momentum is the same for the ball and the rod because angular momentum is conserved in the system.
   - The change in rotational kinetic energy is not necessarily the same for the ball and the rod because rotational kinetic energy depends on the moment of inertia and angular velocity.

From this analysis, the correct statement is:

"To solve this, I will consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: The object has a mass of 2 kg and is acted upon by three forces, each of magnitude 4 N. The net force depends on the directions of these forces. Using Newton's second law, \( F_{\text{net}} = ma \), the acceleration \( a \) can be calculated as \( a = F_{\text{net}} / m \).

2. **Determine the possible net forces**: The forces can combine in various ways depending on their directions. The maximum net force occurs when all three forces act in the same direction, giving \( F_{\text{net}} = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 \, \text{N} \). The minimum net force occurs when the forces cancel each other out, giving \( F_{\text{net}} = 0 \, \text{N} \). Intermediate values of \( F_{\text{net}} \) are possible depending on the angles between the forces.

3. **Calculate the possible accelerations**: Using \( a = F_{\text{net}} / m \), the maximum acceleration is \( a = 12 / 2 = 6 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and the minimum acceleration is \( a = 0 / 2 = 0 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). Any acceleration between 0 and 6 m/s² is possible.

4. **Analyze the choices**: The given choices are:
   - a) \( 0 \, \text{m/s}^2 \): This is possible if the forces cancel out.
   - b) \( 2 \, \text{m/s}^2 \): This is possible for a net force of \( F_{\text{net}} = 4 \, \text{N} \).
   - c) \( 4 \, \text{m/s}^2 \): This is possible for a net force of \( F_{\text{net}} = 8 \, \text{N} \).
   - d) \( 8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \): This is NOT possible because the maximum acceleration is \( 6 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Understand the relationship between force and acceleration**: According to Newton's second law, \( F = ma \), where \( F \) is the net force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration. Rearranging, we get \( m = \frac{F}{a} \). This means the slope of a graph of force (\( F \)) versus acceleration (\( a \)) represents the mass (\( m \)) of the object.

2. **Identify the type of mass measured**: The mass that relates force and acceleration in Newton's second law is the **inertial mass**, which quantifies an object's resistance to changes in motion.

3. **Eliminate incorrect options**: 
   - Gravitational mass (a) is related to the gravitational force and is not directly measured here.
   - Weight (b) is the gravitational force acting on an object and is not the slope of this graph.
   - Velocity (c) is unrelated to the slope of a force vs. acceleration graph.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I need to consider the factors that affect the frictional force. The frictional force is given by \( f = \mu N \), where \( \mu \) is the coefficient of friction and \( N \) is the normal force. The normal force is equal to the weight of the block, which depends on its mass.

1. The frictional force does not depend on the surface area of contact but rather on the normal force and the coefficient of friction. Changing the dimensions of the block (height and length) does not affect the weight or the normal force, as the material and density remain the same.

2. Since the block's material and weight remain unchanged, the normal force \( N \) and the coefficient of friction \( \mu \) remain constant.

3. Therefore, the frictional force experienced by the new block will be the same as the original block.

"To solve this, I will use the mirror equation:  
1/f = 1/v + 1/u,  
where f is the focal length, v is the image distance, and u is the object distance.  

Step 1: Assign the given values.  
The object distance u = -10 cm (negative because the object is in front of the mirror).  
The image distance v = -2 cm (negative because the image is behind the mirror).  

Step 2: Substitute the values into the mirror equation.  
1/f = 1/v + 1/u  
1/f = 1/(-2) + 1/(-10)  
1/f = -1/2 - 1/10.  

Step 3: Simplify the equation.  
Find a common denominator for -1/2 and -1/10, which is 10.  
1/f = -5/10 - 1/10  
1/f = -6/10  
1/f = -3/5.  

Step 4: Solve for f.  
f = -5/3 cm.  

Thus, the focal length of the mirror is -5/3 cm. The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to calculate the distance traveled by the body during the first second when it moves at a constant speed of 24 m/s. The distance is given by \( d = v \cdot t \), so \( d = 24 \cdot 1 = 24 \) meters.

Next, from \( t = 1 \) second to \( t = 11 \) seconds, the body experiences a constant acceleration of -6 m/s². The initial velocity at \( t = 1 \) second is 24 m/s. Using the kinematic equation \( x = v_0 \cdot t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \), where \( v_0 = 24 \) m/s, \( a = -6 \) m/s², and \( t = 10 \) seconds (from \( t = 1 \) to \( t = 11 \)), the displacement during this period is:

\[
x = 24 \cdot 10 + \frac{1}{2} (-6) \cdot (10)^2
\]
\[
x = 240 - 3 \cdot 100 = 240 - 300 = -60 \, \text{meters}.
\]

Finally, the total position of the body at \( t = 11 \) seconds is the sum of the displacement during the first second and the displacement during the next 10 seconds:
\[
x_{\text{total}} = 24 + (-60) = -36 \, \text{meters}.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I will use the principles of fluid dynamics, specifically the continuity equation and Bernoulli's equation.

1. **Continuity Equation**: The flow rate is constant, so \( A_1 V_1 = A_2 V_2 \), where \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the pipe. At Point 1, the area is \( A_1 = \pi (d/2)^2 \), and at Point 2, the area is \( A_2 = \pi (d/6)^2 \). Simplifying, \( A_2 = A_1 / 9 \). Therefore, \( V_2 = 9V_1 = 9V \).

2. **Bernoulli's Equation**: For a horizontal pipe with negligible viscosity, \( P_1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho V_1^2 = P_2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho V_2^2 \). Substituting \( V_2 = 9V \), we get:
   \[
   P_1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 = P_2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho (9V)^2
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   P_1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 = P_2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho (81V^2)
   \]

3. **Solve for \( P_2 - P_1 \)**: Rearrange to find the pressure difference:
   \[
   P_1 - P_2 = \frac{1}{2} \rho (81V^2 - V^2) = \frac{1}{2} \rho (80V^2)
   \]
   Thus, \( P_2 \) is less than \( P_1 \) by \( 40 \rho V^2 \).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. The maximum speed of the block in a spring-block oscillator occurs when the block passes through the equilibrium position. At this point, all the energy of the system is kinetic energy.

2. The total mechanical energy of the oscillator is given by \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), where \( k \) is the spring constant and \( A \) is the amplitude of oscillation.

3. At the equilibrium position, the total energy is entirely kinetic, so \( \frac{1}{2}mv_{\text{max}}^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). Simplifying, \( v_{\text{max}} = A\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).

4. From this equation, we see that the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) is directly proportional to the amplitude \( A \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, I will use the formula for gravitational force: \( F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \), where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses, and \( r \) is the radius.

1. The weight of the box on Earth is given as 80 N. This weight is proportional to the gravitational force on Earth, which depends on the Earth's mass and radius.
2. On the moon, the mass is \( \frac{1}{80} \) of the Earth's mass, and the radius is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the Earth's radius. The gravitational force on the moon will be proportional to \( \frac{1/80}{(1/4)^2} = \frac{1/80}{1/16} = \frac{1}{5} \) of the gravitational force on Earth.
3. Therefore, the weight of the box on the moon is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 80 = 16 \) N.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I will consider the effect of the mountain's height on the gravitational force acting on the textbook.

1. The weight of an object is determined by the gravitational force, which decreases with the square of the distance from the center of the Earth. At sea level, the textbook weighs 30 N, and the distance from the Earth's center is 6,400 km (6,400,000 m).

2. On the mountain peak, the distance from the Earth's center increases by 6,000 m, making the total distance 6,406,000 m. The weight of the textbook will be proportional to the inverse square of the distance.

3. The ratio of the textbook's weight on the mountain to its weight at sea level is:
   \[
   \left(\frac{6,400,000}{6,406,000}\right)^2
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \left(\frac{6,400}{6,406}\right)^2 \approx \left(1 - \frac{6}{6,400}\right)^2 \approx (1 - 0.0009375)^2 \approx 0.9981
   \]
   So, the textbook's weight on the mountain is approximately 99.81% of its weight at sea level:
   \[
   30 \times 0.9981 \approx 29.94 \, \text{N}.
   \]

4. Since 29.94 N is very close to 30 N, the best estimate for the textbook's weight on the mountain is 30 N.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. In free fall, the object is subject to two forces: gravity pulling it downward and a drag force opposing its motion. The drag force is proportional to the object's speed, meaning it increases as the object falls faster.

2. Initially, the object starts from rest, so its speed increases as it falls. However, as the speed increases, the drag force also increases, which reduces the net force acting on the object. Since acceleration is proportional to the net force, the acceleration decreases as the drag force grows.

3. The object does not reach terminal speed because it strikes the ground before that happens. Therefore, the motion is characterized by increasing speed but decreasing acceleration due to the growing drag force.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I will use the lens formula and magnification formula step by step:

1. **Determine the focal length of the lens**:  
   The lens maker's formula is:  
   \( \frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right) \),  
   where \( n \) is the refractive index of the lens material, and \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) are the radii of curvature of the two surfaces.  
   For a bi-convex lens, \( R_1 = 20 \, \text{cm} \) and \( R_2 = -20 \, \text{cm} \) (negative because the second surface is concave relative to the incoming light). Assuming \( n = 1.5 \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{f} = (1.5 - 1) \left( \frac{1}{20} - \frac{1}{-20} \right) = 0.5 \left( \frac{1}{20} + \frac{1}{20} \right) = 0.5 \times \frac{2}{20} = \frac{1}{20}.
   \]  
   So, \( f = 20 \, \text{cm} \).

2. **Use the lens formula to find the image distance**:  
   The lens formula is:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u},
   \]  
   where \( f = 20 \, \text{cm} \), \( u = -30 \, \text{cm} \) (negative because the object is on the same side as the incoming light), and \( v \) is the image distance.  
   Substituting:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{-30} \implies \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{30}.
   \]  
   Simplify:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{20} - \frac{1}{30} = \frac{3}{60} - \frac{2}{60} = \frac{1}{60}.
   \]  
   So, \( v = 60 \, \text{cm} \).

3. **Determine the nature and size of the image**:  
   The image is real because \( v > 0 \) (positive image distance).  
   The magnification \( M \) is given by:  
   \[
   M = -\frac{v}{u} = -\frac{60}{-30} = 2.
   \]  
   The height of the image is:  
   \[
   h' = M \cdot h = 2 \cdot 2 = 4 \, \text{cm}.
   \]  
   The image is inverted because the magnification is negative.

Thus, the image is **real, inverted, and has a height of 4 cm**. However, none of the given options match this result. Please verify the question or choices."
"First, I need to determine the total net charge of the system before the spheres come into contact. The total charge is (+5e) + (-6e) = -1e.

Next, when the spheres come into contact, charge will redistribute between them. The total charge of the system must remain conserved, meaning the sum of the charges on the two spheres after contact must still equal -1e.

Now, I evaluate the given options:
- For option a) +3e and -4e: The sum of these charges is (+3e) + (-4e) = -1e, which satisfies charge conservation. This is a valid combination.
- For option b) +1.5e and -2.5e: The sum of these charges is (+1.5e) + (-2.5e) = -1e, which also satisfies charge conservation. This is another valid combination.

Since both options a) and b) are valid, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's think step by step:

1. The circumference \( C \) of the balloon is related to its volume \( V \), and the volume of the balloon is proportional to the temperature \( T \) (assuming ideal gas behavior). Specifically, \( V \propto T \), and since \( V \propto C^3 \), it follows that \( C^3 \propto T \).

2. This means that \( C^3 \) and \( T \) are directly proportional, resulting in a linear relationship between \( C^3 \) and \( T \).

3. Based on this, the student should not expect a cubic relationship, an indirect relationship, or a maximum \( C^3 \) as \( T \) increases. However, if \( T \) were extrapolated to zero, \( C^3 \) would also approach zero, as the proportionality \( C^3 \propto T \) implies.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to recall that the charge on an oil drop is quantized and is always a multiple of the elementary charge, e = 1.6 × 10^-19 C. 

Next, I will check if each of the given charges is a multiple of 1.6 × 10^-19 C:
- For a) 6.4 × 10^-19 C: 6.4 ÷ 1.6 = 4, which is an integer, so this is valid.
- For b) 8.0 × 10^-19 C: 8.0 ÷ 1.6 = 5, which is an integer, so this is valid.
- For c) 4.8 × 10^-19 C: 4.8 ÷ 1.6 = 3, which is an integer, so this is valid.
- For d) 2.4 × 10^-19 C: 2.4 ÷ 1.6 = 1.5, which is not an integer, so this is not valid.

Finally, the measurement that should be rejected is d) 2.4 × 10^-19 C. 

{'sol': 'd'}"
"To solve this, I will consider the following steps:

1. The magnetic force acts perpendicular to the velocity of the proton, causing it to move in a helical path. However, the magnetic force does no work on the proton because it is always perpendicular to the velocity. This means the speed of the proton remains constant.

2. The initial speed of the proton is given as \( 1.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \). Since the magnetic field does not change the speed of the proton, the speed remains the same regardless of the time elapsed.

3. Therefore, the proton's speed 4 seconds after entering the magnetic field is still \( 1.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I will use Ohm's Law, which states that \( I = \frac{V}{R} \), where \( I \) is the current, \( V \) is the voltage, and \( R \) is the resistance.

1. Analyze the effect of increased voltage and increased resistance (choice a): Increasing \( V \) increases \( I \), but increasing \( R \) decreases \( I \). The net effect depends on the relative changes, so this does not always increase the current.

2. Analyze the effect of decreased voltage and decreased resistance (choice b): Decreasing \( V \) decreases \( I \), but decreasing \( R \) increases \( I \). Again, the net effect depends on the relative changes, so this does not always increase the current.

3. Analyze the effect of increased voltage and decreased resistance (choice c): Increasing \( V \) increases \( I \), and decreasing \( R \) also increases \( I \). Both changes work together to always increase the current.

4. Analyze the effect of decreased voltage and increased resistance (choice d): Decreasing \( V \) decreases \( I \), and increasing \( R \) also decreases \( I \). Both changes work together to always decrease the current.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Option a**: The centrifugal force is the action-reaction pair of the centripetal force.  
   This is incorrect. The centripetal force is the real force that acts toward the center of the circular path, keeping the object in motion. The centrifugal force is a fictitious force that appears in a rotating reference frame and is not part of an action-reaction pair.

2. **Option b**: The centripetal acceleration and velocity point in the same direction.  
   This is incorrect. The centripetal acceleration always points toward the center of the circular path, while the velocity is tangential to the path. They are perpendicular to each other.

3. **Option c**: The velocity of the object in motion changes whereas the acceleration of the object is constant.  
   This is incorrect. In uniform circular motion, the magnitude of the velocity remains constant, but its direction changes continuously. The centripetal acceleration also has a constant magnitude but changes direction as it always points toward the center.

4. **Option d**: A satellite undergoing uniform circular motion is falling toward the center in a circular path.  
   This is correct. A satellite in uniform circular motion is in free fall toward the center due to gravity, but its tangential velocity ensures it keeps moving in a circular orbit rather than spiraling inward.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, we observe that the cart is moving east but its speed decreases from 25 cm/s to 15 cm/s between t1 and t2. This indicates that the cart is slowing down, meaning there is a net force acting opposite to its direction of motion (east).

Next, according to Newton's second law, the net force is in the same direction as the change in momentum. Since the cart's momentum is decreasing, the net force must be directed opposite to the cart's motion (west).

Finally, the information provided is sufficient to determine the direction of the net force because the change in velocity (and thus momentum) is given, and the net force is directly related to this change.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the tension in the cables pulling the elevator, I need to consider the forces acting on the elevator. The tension in the cable must counteract the gravitational force (weight) and provide any additional force required for acceleration. 

1. The gravitational force is determined by the mass of the elevator and the acceleration due to gravity (g). 
2. If the elevator is accelerating, the tension must also account for the net force required for that acceleration, which depends on the mass and the acceleration of the elevator.
3. Velocity and height are not directly relevant to calculating the tension in this scenario.

Therefore, the values needed are the mass and acceleration of the elevator. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. For the resultant vector to be zero, the two vectors must cancel each other out completely. This means their magnitudes must be equal, and their directions must be opposite.
2. If the two vectors have equal magnitude but are pointed in the same direction, their sum would not be zero; it would result in a vector with twice the magnitude in the same direction.
3. If the two vectors have different magnitudes, they cannot cancel each other out, even if they are pointed in opposite directions.
4. It is indeed possible for the sum of two non-zero vectors to be zero, provided they have equal magnitude and opposite directions.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the properties of a solenoid. A solenoid generates a magnetic field along its axis when current flows through it. The magnetic field inside the solenoid is uniform and directed along the axis of the solenoid.

Next, I need to analyze the motion of the proton. A charged particle like a proton experiences a force due to a magnetic field, given by the Lorentz force: **F = q(v × B)**. Here, **q** is the charge of the proton, **v** is its velocity, and **B** is the magnetic field. Since the proton is moving along the axis of the solenoid, its velocity vector is parallel to the magnetic field vector. The cross product of two parallel vectors is zero, so the magnetic force on the proton is zero.

Finally, since there is no magnetic force acting on the proton, it will not deviate from its straight-line motion, nor will it slow down (assuming no other forces are acting on it). The proton will continue moving in a straight line at constant velocity.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"The speed of sound in air is determined by the properties of the medium (such as temperature, pressure, and composition) and is independent of the frequency of the sound wave. 

Step 1: Recall that the speed of sound in air is not affected by the frequency of the sound wave. It depends only on the medium's properties.

Step 2: Since the medium (air) remains the same, the speed of the sound wave will remain the same regardless of whether the frequency is f or 4f.

Step 3: Therefore, the speed of the sound wave with frequency 4f will still be v.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. The net electric flux through a closed surface is given by Gauss's law, which states that the net electric flux is proportional to the total charge enclosed within the surface, regardless of the distribution of the charge or the presence of external charges. Mathematically, it is expressed as:
   \[
   \Phi_E = \frac{Q_{\text{enclosed}}}{\epsilon_0}
   \]
   where \( Q_{\text{enclosed}} \) is the total charge enclosed by the surface, and \( \epsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space.

2. Gauss's law applies universally to any closed surface, regardless of the symmetry of the charge distribution or the presence of charges outside the surface. External charges do not contribute to the net flux through the surface because their field lines enter and exit the surface, canceling out their contributions.

3. Therefore, the net electric flux through a closed surface is always proportional to the enclosed charge, under any conditions.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the properties of light as it transitions between mediums. The frequency of light remains constant when it moves from one medium to another because it is determined by the source of the light.

Next, the speed of light changes when it enters a medium with a different refractive index. In this case, the speed of light decreases as it enters the glass from the air.

Finally, since the speed of light changes and the frequency remains constant, the wavelength must also change to maintain the relationship \( v = f \lambda \), where \( v \) is the speed, \( f \) is the frequency, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I will use the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \), where \( P \) is pressure, \( V \) is volume, \( n \) is the number of moles, \( R \) is the gas constant, and \( T \) is temperature.

1. Rearrange the ideal gas law to express \( V \) (volume) as a function of \( T \) (temperature):  
   \( V = \frac{nR}{P} T \).  
   Here, \( V \) is directly proportional to \( T \), and the slope of the graph is \( \frac{nR}{P} \).

2. The slope \( \frac{nR}{P} \) is linearly proportional to \( \frac{1}{P} \), meaning it is inversely proportional to the pressure \( P \).  

3. Since the ideal gas law does not include any constant term independent of \( T \), the y-intercept of the graph (volume when \( T = 0 \)) will be \( 0 \, \text{m}^3 \).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I will use Newton's Third Law of Motion, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means the force exerted by the car on the truck is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted by the truck on the car.

1. The force on both the car and the truck is the same in magnitude but opposite in direction. However, the acceleration depends on the mass of the object, as per Newton's Second Law: \( F = ma \), where \( a = F/m \).

2. Since the truck's mass is double the car's mass, the car will experience a greater acceleration because acceleration is inversely proportional to mass. Specifically, the car's acceleration will be double the truck's acceleration.

3. The direction of the car's acceleration will be opposite to the direction of the truck's acceleration because the forces are in opposite directions.

Thus, the car's acceleration is double the magnitude of the truck's acceleration and in the opposite direction.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the forces acting on the objects. Since the incline is extremely slick and there is negligible friction, the only force causing the objects to accelerate down the incline is the component of gravity along the incline.

Next, I note that the acceleration of an object sliding down a frictionless incline depends only on the angle of the incline and not on the shape or mass of the object. This is because the acceleration is given by \( a = g \sin(\theta) \), where \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity and \( \theta \) is the angle of the incline.

Finally, since all three objects (sphere, cube, and cylinder) have the same mass and are subject to the same gravitational force, they will all experience the same acceleration and reach the base of the incline at the same time.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to calculate the acceleration of the car. Since the car starts from rest, the initial velocity \( u = 0 \), the final velocity \( v = 20.0 \, \text{m/s} \), and the time \( t = 15.0 \, \text{s} \). Using the formula for acceleration \( a = \frac{v - u}{t} \), we get \( a = \frac{20.0 - 0}{15.0} = 1.33 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

Next, I use the formula for distance traveled under uniform acceleration: \( s = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \). Substituting \( u = 0 \), \( a = 1.33 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( t = 15.0 \, \text{s} \), we get \( s = 0 + \frac{1}{2} (1.33) (15.0)^2 = 0.665 \times 225 = 149.625 \, \text{m} \).

Finally, rounding to the nearest whole number, the distance traveled is approximately \( 150 \, \text{m} \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the relationship between range and maximum height**:  
   The horizontal range \( R \) of a projectile is given by:  
   \[
   R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
   \]  
   The maximum vertical displacement (height) \( H \) is given by:  
   \[
   H = \frac{v_0^2 \sin^2(\theta)}{2g}
   \]  
   We are tasked to find the angle \( \theta \) such that \( R = H \).

2. **Set \( R = H \) and simplify**:  
   Equating the two expressions:  
   \[
   \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} = \frac{v_0^2 \sin^2(\theta)}{2g}
   \]  
   Cancel \( v_0^2 \) and \( g \) from both sides:  
   \[
   \sin(2\theta) = \frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{2}
   \]  
   Use the trigonometric identity \( \sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta) \):  
   \[
   2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta) = \frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{2}
   \]  

3. **Solve for \( \theta \)**:  
   Divide through by \( \sin(\theta) \) (assuming \( \sin(\theta) \neq 0 \)):  
   \[
   2\cos(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{2}
   \]  
   Multiply through by 2:  
   \[
   4\cos(\theta) = \sin(\theta)
   \]  
   Divide both sides by \( \cos(\theta) \):  
   \[
   4 = \tan(\theta)
   \]  
   Therefore, \( \theta = \tan^{-1}(4) \).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this problem, I need to determine the angle at which the cannon should be pointed to maximize the range of the projectile. 

1. The range of a projectile is maximized when the angle of launch is 45° relative to the horizontal, assuming no air resistance and that the launch and landing occur at the same height. This is because the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity are balanced at this angle, maximizing the distance traveled.

2. The forward motion of the truck (5 m/s) adds to the horizontal velocity of the projectile, but it does not affect the optimal launch angle for maximum range. The physics of projectile motion remains the same, and the angle for maximum range is still 45°.

3. Therefore, the operator should point the cannon at an angle of 45° from the horizontal to achieve the maximum range.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I will analyze the situation step by step:

1. The net force between the two particles is 0 N. This means that the attractive or repulsive electric force between the charges is exactly balanced by the gravitational force between their masses.

2. The electric force depends on the charges and the distance between the particles, while the gravitational force depends on their masses and the distance. For the forces to balance, the charges and masses must be related in a specific way.

3. The particles do not necessarily need to have the same mass, as the gravitational force depends on the product of the two masses, not their equality. Similarly, the charges do not need to have the same sign, as the electric force can be attractive or repulsive depending on the signs of the charges.

4. If the distance between the particles changes, the balance of forces will no longer hold because the electric and gravitational forces depend differently on the distance (inverse square law).

5. Such a situation is not impossible; it is theoretically possible for the forces to balance under specific conditions.

The statement that is NOT true is: ""The particles must have the same mass.""

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. **Statement a**: ""The acceleration vector points opposite to the velocity vector on the way up and in the same direction as the velocity vector on the way down.""  
   This is incorrect because the acceleration due to gravity always points downward, regardless of whether the projectile is moving up or down. It does not change direction.

2. **Statement b**: ""The speed at the top of the trajectory is zero.""  
   This is incorrect because, at the top of the trajectory, the vertical component of the velocity is zero, but the horizontal component of the velocity remains constant (assuming no air resistance). Therefore, the total speed is not zero.

3. **Statement c**: ""The object's total speed remains constant during the entire flight.""  
   This is incorrect because the vertical component of the velocity changes due to gravity, which causes the total speed to vary throughout the flight.

4. **Statement d**: ""The vertical speed decreases on the way up and increases on the way down.""  
   This is correct because gravity acts downward, causing the vertical component of the velocity to decrease as the projectile moves upward and to increase as it moves downward.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to recall that the electric force between two charged objects is determined by Coulomb's law, which depends on the charges of the objects and the distance between them, not their masses. 

Next, since the problem states that the charges of the balls remain the same and the distance between them is unchanged, the electric force will not be affected by the change in mass of one of the balls.

Finally, the electric force remains the same as the original value of 50 μN because mass does not influence the electric force in this scenario.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Understand the collision**: The two carts stick together after the collision, meaning they move as a single object with the same velocity. This is a perfectly inelastic collision.

2. **Key property of inelastic collisions**: In a perfectly inelastic collision, the two objects stick together and move with the same velocity after the collision. However, their kinetic energy is not conserved, as some of it is converted into other forms of energy (e.g., heat or deformation). Their masses remain unchanged, and their individual linear momenta are not the same, but the total linear momentum of the system is conserved.

3. **Determine the correct answer**: Since the two carts stick together, they must have the same velocity immediately after the collision. This is the key property of a perfectly inelastic collision.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, I will use the kinematic equation for free fall: \( v^2 = u^2 + 2gh \), where:
- \( v \) is the final velocity (30 m/s),
- \( u \) is the initial velocity (0 m/s, since the rock is dropped),
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²),
- \( h \) is the height of the cliff.

Step 1: Substitute the known values into the equation: \( 30^2 = 0^2 + 2(9.8)h \).

Step 2: Simplify the equation: \( 900 = 19.6h \).

The closest answer is 45 m. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The car is moving up an incline with an angle θ, and we are neglecting friction and air resistance. The only force acting on the car is gravity, which has components along the incline and perpendicular to the incline.

2. The horizontal acceleration \( a_x \) is the component of the gravitational acceleration \( g \) along the horizontal direction. Since the incline is at an angle θ, the horizontal acceleration is \( a_x = g \sin \theta \). This means \( a_x \) is less than \( g \), but it is not zero.

3. The vertical acceleration \( a_y \) is the component of the gravitational acceleration \( g \) along the vertical direction. Gravity acts directly downward, so the vertical acceleration is \( a_y = g \). 

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which option increases the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor, let's analyze step by step:

1. The capacitance \( C \) of a parallel-plate capacitor is given by the formula:
   \[
   C = \frac{\varepsilon A}{d}
   \]
   where:
   - \( \varepsilon \) is the permittivity of the dielectric material between the plates,
   - \( A \) is the area of the plates,
   - \( d \) is the distance between the plates.

2. Option a) Using smaller plates: Reducing the plate area \( A \) decreases the capacitance because \( C \) is directly proportional to \( A \). This does not increase the capacitance.

3. Option b) Replacing the dielectric material with one that has a smaller dielectric constant: The dielectric constant \( \varepsilon \) is directly proportional to capacitance. Using a material with a smaller dielectric constant decreases \( C \). This does not increase the capacitance.

4. Option c) Decreasing the voltage between the plates: The voltage \( V \) does not directly affect the capacitance, as capacitance depends only on the physical properties of the capacitor (plate area, distance, and dielectric material). This does not increase the capacitance.

5. Option d) Moving the plates closer together: Decreasing the distance \( d \) increases the capacitance because \( C \) is inversely proportional to \( d \). This would increase the capacitance.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will analyze each option step by step to determine if it changes the angular momentum of the man-platform system.

1. Angular momentum is conserved in a closed system unless an external torque acts on it. The man-platform system is isolated, so we need to check if any external forces or torques are involved in each scenario.

2. Option a) The man catches a baseball thrown to him by a friend. Here, the baseball is an external object entering the system. When the man catches the baseball, the angular momentum of the system changes because the baseball brings in additional angular momentum. This involves an external interaction.

3. Option b) The man thrusts his arms out away from his body. This action redistributes the mass within the system but does not involve any external forces or torques. The angular momentum of the system remains conserved.

4. Option c) The man thrusts his arms out away from his body, and then quickly brings his arms back to his side again. Similar to option b, this action only redistributes the mass within the system. There are no external forces or torques, so the angular momentum remains conserved.

5. Option d) The man jumps straight up in the air and lands back on the platform. This action occurs entirely within the system, with no external forces or torques acting on it. The angular momentum remains conserved.

The only scenario where the angular momentum of the system changes is option a, due to the external interaction with the baseball.

"First, I recognize that this is an isothermal process, meaning the temperature remains constant. For an isothermal process, the relationship between pressure and volume is given by Boyle's Law: \( P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2 \).

Next, I substitute the given values into the equation. The initial pressure \( P_1 = 1 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \), the initial volume \( V_1 = 20 \, \text{cm}^3 \), and the final volume \( V_2 = 5 \, \text{cm}^3 \). I solve for the final pressure \( P_2 \):  
\[
P_2 = \frac{P_1 V_1}{V_2} = \frac{(1 \times 10^5)(20)}{5}.
\]

Finally, I calculate \( P_2 \):

"To determine which type of electromagnetic radiation has the longest wavelength, I need to consider the electromagnetic spectrum. 

1. Gamma rays have the shortest wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum, so they are not the answer.
2. Ultraviolet radiation has shorter wavelengths than visible light, so it is not the answer.
3. Blue light has a shorter wavelength than orange light within the visible spectrum.
4. Orange light has a longer wavelength than blue light and is part of the visible spectrum.

"First, I need to calculate the input power of the motor. The input power is given by multiplying the voltage and current: \( P_{input} = 120V \times 1.0A = 120W \).

Next, I calculate the output power of the motor using its efficiency. The efficiency is 75%, so the output power is \( P_{output} = 120W \times 0.75 = 90W \).

Now, I use the formula for power in terms of force and velocity: \( P = F \times v \). The force required to lift the 6 kg mass is equal to its weight, which is \( F = m \times g = 6 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 58.8 \, \text{N} \).

Rearranging the formula for velocity, \( v = \frac{P}{F} \), I substitute the values: \( v = \frac{90 \, \text{W}}{58.8 \, \text{N}} \approx 1.53 \, \text{m/s} \).

Therefore, the closest answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Lens formula and image formation**: The lens formula is \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u} \), where \( f \) is the focal length, \( u \) is the object distance, and \( v \) is the image distance. For a convex lens, when the object is outside the focal length (\( u > f \)), the image is real and inverted. When the object is within the focal length (\( u < f \)), the image is virtual, upright, and magnified.

2. **Initial position of the lens**: When the lens is 0.3 m above the coin, the object distance \( u = 0.3 \, \text{m} \). Since \( u > f = 0.2 \, \text{m} \), the image is real, inverted, and smaller than the object. As the lens moves closer to the coin, \( u \) decreases.

3. **Final position of the lens**: When the lens is 0.1 m above the coin, the object distance \( u = 0.1 \, \text{m} \). Since \( u < f = 0.2 \, \text{m} \), the image becomes virtual, upright, and magnified. During this transition, the image flips over when \( u = f \), as the image changes from real and inverted to virtual and upright.

Thus, the image flips over during the process. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to calculate the distance from the center of the Earth to the Space Shuttle. This is the sum of Earth's radius (6,400 km) and the altitude of the Space Shuttle (300 km), which equals 6,700 km or 6.7 × 10^6 meters.

Next, I use the formula for gravitational acceleration: \( g = G \cdot \frac{M}{r^2} \), where \( G \) is the gravitational constant (\( 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2 \)), \( M \) is Earth's mass (\( 5.972 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \)), and \( r \) is the distance from the center of the Earth to the object.

Finally, I calculate the gravitational acceleration relative to Earth's surface gravity (\( g_0 = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)) using the ratio \( g = g_0 \cdot \left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^2 \), where \( R \) is Earth's radius (6.4 × 10^6 m). Substituting \( r = 6.7 × 10^6 \, \text{m} \), \( g = 9.8 \cdot \left(\frac{6.4}{6.7}\right)^2 \approx 8.9 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

"To solve this, I will use the formula for weight, which is the gravitational force: \( W = \frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2} \), where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( m_1 \) is the mass of the astronaut, \( m_2 \) is the mass of the planet, and \( r \) is the radius of the planet.

1. On Earth, the astronaut's weight is 800 N. This weight is proportional to Earth's mass \( M \) and inversely proportional to the square of Earth's radius \( R \).

2. On the new planet, the mass is \( 2M \) (twice Earth's mass) and the radius is \( 2R \) (twice Earth's radius). The weight on the new planet will be proportional to \( \frac{2M}{(2R)^2} = \frac{2M}{4R^2} = \frac{1}{2} \) of the weight on Earth.

3. Since the astronaut weighs 800 N on Earth, his weight on the new planet will be \( 800 \times \frac{1}{2} = 400 \, \text{N} \).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider Newton's Third Law of Motion, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means the force exerted by the heavier person on the lighter person is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force felt by the heavier person.

Next, I need to calculate the accelerations of both individuals using Newton's Second Law of Motion, \( F = ma \). For the lighter person, the acceleration is \( a_1 = F / m_1 \), where \( m_1 = 50 \, \text{kg} \). For the heavier person, the acceleration is \( a_2 = F / m_2 \), where \( m_2 = 100 \, \text{kg} \).

Finally, comparing the magnitudes of the accelerations, \( a_1 / a_2 = (F / m_1) / (F / m_2) = m_2 / m_1 = 100 / 50 = 2 \). This shows that the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person is twice that of the heavier person.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor: \( U = \frac{1}{2} \frac{Q^2}{C} \), where \( U \) is the energy, \( Q \) is the charge, and \( C \) is the capacitance.

1. The charge \( Q \) is given as 6 millicoulombs, which is \( 6 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{C} \).
2. The capacitance \( C \) is given as 30 mF, which is \( 30 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{F} \).
3. Substituting these values into the formula:  
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} \frac{(6 \times 10^{-3})^2}{30 \times 10^{-3}}

   Simplify the numerator: \( (6 \times 10^{-3})^2 = 36 \times 10^{-6} \).  
   Divide by \( 30 \times 10^{-3} \):  
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} \frac{36 \times 10^{-6}}{30 \times 10^{-3}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{36}{30} \times 10^{-3}

   Simplify further: \( \frac{36}{30} = 1.2 \), so:  
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} \times 1.2 \times 10^{-3} = 0.6 \times 10^{-3} = 0.0006 \, \text{J} = 0.6 \, \text{J}.

"To determine which configuration creates the greatest current, I will analyze the relationship between voltage, resistance, and current using Ohm's Law (I = V/R).

1. **Step 1: Understand the effect of voltage.** A higher voltage battery will produce a greater current for the same resistance, as current is directly proportional to voltage. Therefore, configurations with a high voltage battery (choices a and b) are more likely to produce greater current than those with a low voltage battery (choices c and d).

2. **Step 2: Understand the effect of resistor arrangement.** Resistors in series add their resistances together, increasing the total resistance of the circuit. Resistors in parallel reduce the total resistance, as the equivalent resistance is less than the smallest individual resistance. Lower resistance results in higher current for the same voltage.

3. **Step 3: Combine the effects.** A high voltage battery with resistors in parallel (choice b) will maximize current because it combines the high voltage with the lowest possible resistance.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate the average force exerted by the floor on the ball step by step:

1. First, calculate the velocity of the ball just before it hits the floor using the equation for free fall: \( v = \sqrt{2gh} \), where \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) and \( h = 3.2 \, \text{m} \). Substituting the values, \( v = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.8 \cdot 3.2} \).

2. The velocity just before impact is \( v = 7.92 \, \text{m/s} \). Since the ball bounces back to nearly the same height, the velocity after the bounce is approximately \( v = 7.92 \, \text{m/s} \) in the opposite direction.

3. The change in velocity (\( \Delta v \)) is \( 7.92 - (-7.92) = 15.84 \, \text{m/s} \).

4. The impulse-momentum theorem states that \( F_{\text{avg}} \cdot \Delta t = m \cdot \Delta v \). Rearranging for \( F_{\text{avg}} \), we get \( F_{\text{avg}} = \frac{m \cdot \Delta v}{\Delta t} \).

5. Substituting the values: \( F_{\text{avg}} = \frac{0.08 \cdot 15.84}{0.04} = 31.68 \, \text{N} \).

"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

The sphere, on the other hand, rolls without slipping, meaning its potential energy is divided between translational kinetic energy and rotational kinetic energy.

2. **Compare the accelerations**: The block experiences a greater acceleration because all of its energy contributes to translational motion. The sphere, however, has a smaller acceleration because part of its energy is used for rotational motion, reducing the energy available for translational motion.

3. **Determine which object reaches the bottom first**: Since the block has a greater acceleration, it will reach the bottom of the ramp before the sphere.

"To determine which change would increase the widths of the fringes in a double-slit interference experiment, let's analyze step by step:

1. The fringe width in a double-slit experiment is given by the formula \( w = \frac{\lambda L}{d} \), where:
   - \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the light,
   - \( L \) is the distance between the slits and the screen,
   - \( d \) is the distance between the two slits.

2. To increase the fringe width \( w \), we need to increase \( \lambda \) or \( L \), or decrease \( d \).

3. Now, let's evaluate each option:
   - a) Using light of a shorter wavelength (\( \lambda \) decreases) would decrease the fringe width, not increase it.
   - b) Moving the screen closer to the slits (\( L \) decreases) would also decrease the fringe width.
   - c) Moving the slits closer together (\( d \) decreases) would increase the fringe width, as \( w \) is inversely proportional to \( d \).
   - d) Using light with a lower wave speed does not directly affect the fringe width, as the wavelength \( \lambda \) and speed are related through the frequency, which remains constant.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to calculate the velocity of the stone after 3 seconds. The formula for velocity under constant acceleration is: \( v = u + at \), where \( u \) is the initial velocity, \( a \) is the acceleration, and \( t \) is the time.

1. The initial velocity \( u \) is 5 m/s (upward). The acceleration \( a \) is due to gravity, which is \( -9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (negative because it acts downward). The time \( t \) is 3 seconds.

2. Substituting the values into the formula: 
   \[
   v = 5 + (-9.8)(3)
   \]
   \[
   v = 5 - 29.4
   \]
   \[
   v = -24.4 \, \text{m/s}

3. The negative sign indicates the velocity is downward. Rounding \( -24.4 \, \text{m/s} \) to the nearest whole number gives \( -25 \, \text{m/s} \).

Therefore, the velocity of the stone 3 seconds later is 25 m/s, downward. The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the position of stable equilibrium, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the equilibrium positions**: Equilibrium occurs where the force is zero, which corresponds to the derivative of the potential energy function \( U(x) \) with respect to \( x \) being zero. That is, solve \( \frac{dU}{dx} = 0 \).

2. **Check the stability of the equilibrium positions**: A position is stable if the second derivative of \( U(x) \), \( \frac{d^2U}{dx^2} \), is positive at that point.

### Step 1: Find equilibrium positions
The potential energy function is \( U(x) = (x - 2)^3 - 12x \). First, compute the first derivative:
\[
\frac{dU}{dx} = 3(x - 2)^2 - 12.
\]
Set \( \frac{dU}{dx} = 0 \) to find the equilibrium positions:
\[
3(x - 2)^2 - 12 = 0.
\]
Simplify:
\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4.
\]
Take the square root of both sides:
\[
x - 2 = \pm 2.
\]
Solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Check stability
To determine stability, compute the second derivative of \( U(x) \):
\[
\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 6(x - 2).
\]
Evaluate \( \frac{d^2U}{dx^2} \) at each equilibrium position:

- At \( x = 4 \):
\[
\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 6(4 - 2) = 12 > 0.
\]
This indicates \( x = 4 \) is a position of stable equilibrium.

- At \( x = 0 \):
\[
\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 6(0 - 2) = -12 < 0.
\]
This indicates \( x = 0 \) is a position of unstable equilibrium.

### Final Answer:
The position of stable equilibrium is \( x = 4 \).

"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Direction of the force on the electron due to the magnetic field**:  
   The force on a charged particle moving in a magnetic field is given by the Lorentz force:  
   \(\vec{F} = q(\vec{v} \times \vec{B})\).  
   Here, the charge of the electron is \(-e\), the velocity \(\vec{v}\) is upwards, and the magnetic field \(\vec{B}\) is into the plane of the page. Using the right-hand rule for \(\vec{v} \times \vec{B}\), the force on a positive charge would point to the left. However, since the electron has a negative charge, the force will point to the right.  

2. **Direction of the circular motion**:  
   The force acts as the centripetal force, causing the electron to move in a circular path. Since the force is to the right of the electron's velocity (upwards), the electron will rotate in a **clockwise** direction.

3. **Radius of the circular path**:  
   The centripetal force is provided by the magnetic force:  
   \[ F = \frac{mv^2}{r} = e v B \]  
   Solving for the radius \(r\):

"To solve this, I will analyze the factors affecting the period of a pendulum step by step:

1. The period of a simple pendulum is given by the formula \( T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} \), where \( T \) is the period, \( L \) is the length of the string, and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity. The formula shows that the period depends only on the length of the string and the acceleration due to gravity, not on the mass of the ball or the angle of release (for small angles).

2. Increasing or decreasing the mass of the ball (choices a and d) does not affect the period, as the mass does not appear in the formula.

3. Decreasing the length of the string (choice b) would decrease the period, as \( T \) is proportional to the square root of \( L \). A shorter string results in a shorter period.

4. Decreasing the angle of release (choice c) does not significantly affect the period for small angles, as the formula assumes small oscillations where the angle does not matter.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

2. As the object moves closer to the mirror (toward the center of curvature), the image also moves farther away from the mirror and becomes larger. When the object is at the center of curvature, the image is the same size as the object and is located at the center of curvature.

3. As the object moves even closer to the focal point, the image continues to move farther away from the mirror and becomes taller (larger). When the object is at the focal point, no image is formed because the reflected rays are parallel.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to calculate the angular displacement of the disk in 4.0 seconds. The angular displacement can be found using the formula for rotational motion:

Substituting the values:  
\(\theta = 0 + \frac{1}{2} (2.0) (4.0)^2 = \frac{1}{2} (2.0) (16) = 16 \, \text{rad}\).

Next, I calculate the total distance traveled by a point on the rim of the disk. The distance traveled is the arc length, which is given by:

Substituting the values:  
\(s = 0.1 \times 16 = 1.6 \, \text{m}\).

Therefore, the total distance traveled by a point on the rim of the disk is 1.6 m. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I need to calculate the time it takes for the stone to fall 80 m vertically under the influence of gravity.

1. The vertical motion of the stone is independent of its horizontal motion. The vertical distance \( y \) is given by the equation of motion: \( y = \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \), where \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (acceleration due to gravity) and \( t \) is the time in seconds.

2. Rearrange the equation to solve for \( t \): \( t = \sqrt{\frac{2y}{g}} \). Substituting \( y = 80 \, \text{m} \) and \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), we get:

"To determine the false statement, let's analyze each option step by step:

a) A charge moving along the direction of an electric field will experience a force, but a charge moving along the direction of a magnetic field will not experience a force.  
- This is true. A charge in an electric field experiences a force proportional to the field, regardless of its motion. However, in a magnetic field, the force depends on the velocity of the charge and is given by the cross product \( \vec{F} = q\vec{v} \times \vec{B} \). If the charge moves parallel to the magnetic field (\( \vec{v} \parallel \vec{B} \)), the cross product is zero, and no force is experienced.

b) All charges experience a force in an electric field, but only moving charges can experience a force in a magnetic field.  
- This is true. In an electric field, all charges experience a force \( \vec{F} = q\vec{E} \), regardless of whether they are stationary or moving. In a magnetic field, the force depends on the velocity of the charge, so stationary charges do not experience a force.

c) A positive charge moves in the direction of an electric field; a positive charge moves perpendicular to a magnetic field.  
- This is partially incorrect. A positive charge does move in the direction of the electric field due to the force \( \vec{F} = q\vec{E} \). However, in a magnetic field, the force is perpendicular to both the velocity of the charge and the magnetic field (\( \vec{F} = q\vec{v} \times \vec{B} \)), not necessarily the charge's motion.

d) All moving charges experience a force parallel to an electric field and perpendicular to a magnetic field.  
- This is false. While the force due to an electric field is parallel to the field, the force due to a magnetic field is perpendicular to both the velocity of the charge and the magnetic field. Thus, the statement is incorrect because it oversimplifies the nature of the magnetic force.

The false statement is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will use the formula for gravitational acceleration: \( g = \frac{G \cdot M}{r^2} \), where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M \) is the mass of the Earth, and \( r \) is the distance from the center of the Earth to the object.

1. The radius of the Earth is 6400 km, and the Space Shuttle orbits 300 km above the surface. Therefore, the total distance from the center of the Earth to the Space Shuttle is \( r = 6400 + 300 = 6700 \) km, which is \( 6700 \times 10^3 \) meters.

2. The acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface is \( g_0 = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and it decreases with the square of the distance from the Earth's center. The formula to find the acceleration at a distance \( r \) is:
   \[
   g = g_0 \cdot \left( \frac{R}{r} \right)^2
   \]
   where \( R \) is the Earth's radius (6400 km or \( 6400 \times 10^3 \) meters).

3. Substituting the values:
   \[
   g = 9.8 \cdot \left( \frac{6400}{6700} \right)^2
   \]
   First, calculate \( \frac{6400}{6700} \):
   \[
   \frac{6400}{6700} \approx 0.9552
   \]
   Then square this value:
   \[
   (0.9552)^2 \approx 0.9124
   \]
   Multiply by 9.8:
   \[
   g \approx 9.8 \cdot 0.9124 \approx 8.9 \, \text{m/s}^2

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the cyclical process**: In a cyclical process, the system returns to its initial state at the end of the cycle. This means that the change in internal energy (\( \Delta U \)) over the entire cycle is zero because internal energy is a state function.

2. **Work and heat in a cycle**: From the first law of thermodynamics, \( \Delta U = Q - W \), where \( Q \) is the heat added to the system and \( W \) is the work done by the system. Since \( \Delta U = 0 \) for a complete cycle, it follows that \( Q = W \). This means the total work done during the cycle is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the net heat transferred.

3. **Evaluating the options**:
   - (a) The change in internal energy of the gas is equal to the work done during the isobaric step. This is incorrect because the change in internal energy depends on the heat and work for all steps, not just the isobaric step.
   - (b) The change in internal energy of the gas is equal to the work done during the isobaric step minus the work done during the isothermal step. This is also incorrect because the internal energy change depends on the entire cycle, and for a full cycle, \( \Delta U = 0 \).
   - (c) The total work done during the cycle is positive. This is not necessarily true; the total work done can be positive, negative, or zero depending on the specific details of the cycle.
   - (d) The total work done during the cycle is equal but opposite to the net amount of heat transferred. This is correct because, for a cyclical process, \( Q = W \), and the total work done is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the net heat transferred.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The sphere is rolling without slipping, which means there is no relative motion between the point of contact of the sphere and the surface of the hill. This implies that the force responsible for the rolling motion must be static friction, as kinetic friction only acts when there is sliding.

2. Static friction acts at the point of contact between the sphere and the hill. This force provides the necessary torque to cause the sphere to rotate as it rolls down the incline.

3. The normal force and gravity do not directly provide torque about the center of the sphere because they act through the center of mass of the sphere. Only the static friction force, which acts tangentially at the point of contact, provides the torque.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the forces acting on the block. The block is dragged along the table, and the table exerts a normal force on the block. The normal force is the force exerted by a surface to support the weight of an object resting on it.

Next, the normal force is always perpendicular to the surface of contact. Since the block is on the table, the force exerted by the table on the block is perpendicular to the table.

Finally, I can conclude that the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the fundamental force responsible for the interaction between the table and the wooden block. The interaction occurs at the atomic level, where the outermost electrons of the atoms in the table and the wooden block come into contact.

Next, I consider the nature of the forces involved. The gravitational force is not responsible because it acts over large distances and is not strong enough to account for the repulsion between the table and the block. The strong nuclear force is also not responsible because it acts only within the nucleus of an atom and does not influence interactions between atoms.

Finally, the electric force is responsible for the interaction because the outer electrons in the atoms of the table and the wooden block repel each other due to their negative charges. This repulsion prevents the block from passing through the table and supports the block.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I will analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a: 1 J/(A*m^2)**  
   - A tesla (T) is defined as a unit of magnetic flux density. From the SI units, 1 tesla = 1 weber per square meter (Wb/m²).  
   - A weber (Wb) is equivalent to 1 joule per ampere (J/A).  
   - Therefore, 1 tesla = 1 J/(A*m²), so this option is correct.

2. **Option b: 1 kg/(C*s)**  
   - Using the relationship between force, charge, and magnetic field, we know that 1 tesla = 1 N/(C*m/s).  
   - A newton (N) is equivalent to 1 kg*m/s², so substituting this into the equation gives:  
     1 tesla = 1 (kg*m/s²)/(C*m/s) = 1 kg/(C*s).  
   - This matches the definition of a tesla, so this option is correct.

3. **Option c: 1 N/(A*m)**  
   - From the definition of a tesla, 1 tesla = 1 N/(A*m).  
   - This is a standard definition of the tesla, so this option is correct.

4. **Option d: 1 A*N/V**  
   - To check this, we analyze the units:  
     - A tesla involves units of force, current, and distance, but ""A*N/V"" does not align with the standard SI units for a tesla.  
   - This option does not match the definition of a tesla.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The toy cart's motion is influenced by the energy transformations occurring during its movement. The shove imparts the same initial kinetic energy to the cart in each trial, but the observed inconsistency in how high the cart goes up the ramp suggests that some of this energy is being dissipated or transformed differently in each trial.

2. The rubber band mechanism introduces variability. Depending on how the rubber band is wound, it could cause additional energy dissipation (e.g., through internal friction or deformation) or affect how energy is transferred between the cart's motion and the rubber band.

3. Friction is a key factor in energy dissipation. If friction varies between trials (e.g., due to differences in how the rubber band interacts with the axle or wheels), some of the cart's initial kinetic energy will be lost as heat, reducing the amount of energy available to be converted into gravitational potential energy as the cart moves up the ramp.

The most reasonable explanation is that some of the cart's initial kinetic energy is dissipated due to work done by friction, leading to variability in how high the cart goes up the ramp.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the motion of the object step by step:

1. The object is in free fall, so it is subject to constant acceleration due to gravity, \( g \). The distance fallen in time \( t \) is given by the equation:
   \[
   s = \frac{1}{2} g t^2
   \]
   where \( s \) is the distance fallen, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( t \) is the time.

2. During the first second (\( t = 1 \)), the distance fallen is:
   \[
   h = \frac{1}{2} g (1)^2 = \frac{1}{2} g
   \]

3. During the next second (from \( t = 1 \) to \( t = 2 \)), the total distance fallen after 2 seconds is:
   \[
   s_2 = \frac{1}{2} g (2)^2 = 2g
   \]
   The distance fallen during the second second is the difference between the total distance fallen after 2 seconds and the distance fallen after 1 second:
   \[
   \text{Distance during second second} = s_2 - h = 2g - \frac{1}{2} g = \frac{3}{2} g
   \]

4. Since \( h = \frac{1}{2} g \), the distance fallen during the second second is:
   \[
   \text{Distance during second second} = 3h
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Understand the collision type**: The problem states that the skaters stick together after the collision, which means it is an inelastic collision. In inelastic collisions, kinetic energy is not conserved, but linear momentum is conserved.

2. **Determine the forces acting on the system**: The skaters are moving on frictionless ice, and there are no external forces acting on the system during the collision. This means the net external force on the system is zero.

3. **Conservation of linear momentum**: Since the net external force on the system is zero, the linear momentum of the system is conserved during the collision. However, kinetic energy is not conserved because it is an inelastic collision.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will use Newton's law of gravitation, which states that the gravitational force \( F \) between two masses is given by:

\[
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
\]

where:
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant, approximately \( 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \),
- \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses of the two objects,
- \( r \) is the distance between the centers of the two objects.

Step 1: Write down the given values:
- \( m_1 = 5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the Earth),
- \( m_2 = 7.35 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the Moon),
- \( r = 3.84 \times 10^8 \, \text{m} \) (distance between Earth and Moon).

Step 2: Substitute the values into the formula:
\[
F = (6.67 \times 10^{-11}) \frac{(5.97 \times 10^{24})(7.35 \times 10^{22})}{(3.84 \times 10^8)^2}
\]

Step 3: Simplify the terms:
- Multiply the masses: \( 5.97 \times 10^{24} \times 7.35 \times 10^{22} = 43.87 \times 10^{46} \),
- Square the distance: \( (3.84 \times 10^8)^2 = 14.74 \times 10^{16} \),
- Divide the masses by the squared distance: \( \frac{43.87 \times 10^{46}}{14.74 \times 10^{16}} = 2.97 \times 10^{30} \),
- Multiply by \( G \): \( (6.67 \times 10^{-11}) \times (2.97 \times 10^{30}) = 1.98 \times 10^{20} \, \text{N} \).

Step 4: Approximate the result:
The gravitational force is approximately \( 10^{20} \, \text{N} \), which is closest to \( 10^{19} \, \text{N} \) in the given choices.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I will use the principle of buoyancy and Archimedes' principle.

1. First, I calculate the buoyant force acting on the object. Since the object floats, the buoyant force equals the weight of the object, which is 6 N.

2. Next, I calculate the volume of water displaced by the object. The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced water. The density of water is approximately 1000 kg/m³, and the gravitational acceleration is 9.8 m/s². Using the formula for weight (W = ρ × V × g), the displaced volume (V) is:
   V = W / (ρ × g) = 6 / (1000 × 9.8) = 6 / 9800 = 6.12 × 10^-4 m³.

3. Finally, I calculate the percentage of the object's volume that is above the water. The total volume of the object is 2 × 10^-3 m³, and the submerged volume is 6.12 × 10^-4 m³. The volume above the water is:
   Volume above = Total volume - Submerged volume = 2 × 10^-3 - 6.12 × 10^-4 = 1.388 × 10^-3 m³.
   The percentage above the water is:
   (Volume above / Total volume) × 100 = (1.388 × 10^-3 / 2 × 10^-3) × 100 ≈ 69.4%.

Thus, approximately 70% of the object's volume is above the surface of the water.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To find the acceleration of the object, I need to calculate the second derivative of the position function \( x(t) \) with respect to time \( t \), as acceleration is the second derivative of position.

1. The position function is given as \( x(t) = 2.0t^3 + 4.0t + 6.25 \). First, I calculate the first derivative (velocity):  
   \( v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = 6.0t^2 + 4.0 \).

2. Next, I calculate the second derivative (acceleration):  
   \( a(t) = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = \frac{dv}{dt} = 12.0t \).

3. To find the acceleration at \( t = 1.50 \, \text{s} \), I substitute \( t = 1.50 \) into \( a(t) \):  
   \( a(1.50) = 12.0 \times 1.50 = 18.0 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine if the normal force does work on the man, we need to analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Understand the concept of work**: Work is done by a force when there is a displacement in the direction of the force. Mathematically, work is given by \( W = F \cdot d \cdot \cos\theta \), where \( F \) is the force, \( d \) is the displacement, and \( \theta \) is the angle between the force and the displacement.

2. **Identify the direction of the normal force and displacement**: The normal force acts vertically upward, perpendicular to the floor of the elevator. As the elevator ascends, the man is displaced vertically upward as well. Therefore, the angle \( \theta \) between the normal force and the displacement is \( 0^\circ \), and \( \cos 0^\circ = 1 \).

3. **Determine if work is done**: Since the normal force and the displacement are in the same direction, the normal force does positive work on the man as the elevator ascends.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, I will use the kinematic equation for uniformly accelerated motion: \( s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \), where:
- \( s \) is the distance (200 m),
- \( u \) is the initial velocity (0 m/s, since the car starts from rest),
- \( a \) is the acceleration (5 m/s²),
- \( t \) is the time (what we need to find).

Step 1: Substitute the known values into the equation:
\( 200 = 0 \cdot t + \frac{1}{2}(5)t^2 \),
which simplifies to:
\( 200 = \frac{5}{2}t^2 \).

Step 2: Solve for \( t^2 \):
Multiply through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
\( 400 = 5t^2 \),
then divide by 5:
\( t^2 = 80 \).

Step 3: Solve for \( t \):
Take the square root of both sides:
\( t = \sqrt{80} \approx 8.94 \, \text{s} \).

The closest answer is 9.0 s.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the conditions for static equilibrium step by step:

1. **Condition I**: The vector sum of all torques on the object must equal zero.  
   This is a necessary condition for static equilibrium because if there is a net torque, the object would rotate, violating the static equilibrium condition.

2. **Condition II**: The vector sum of all forces on the object must equal zero.  
   This is also a necessary condition for static equilibrium because if there is a net force, the object would accelerate, violating the static equilibrium condition.

3. **Condition III**: The sum of the object’s potential and kinetic energies must be zero.  
   This is not a necessary condition for static equilibrium. The potential energy can have any value, and the kinetic energy must be zero for the object to remain static, but their sum does not need to be zero.

Thus, both conditions I and II are necessary for static equilibrium, but condition III is not.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The puck is initially pushed by the student, causing it to accelerate in the positive direction. However, after the student lets go, the only forces acting on the puck are friction (opposing the motion) and gravity. Gravity is balanced by the normal force from the table, so the net force is determined by friction.

2. The puck is moving in the positive direction but slowing down as it approaches rest at position x = 1.2 m. This indicates that the net force acting on the puck must be in the negative direction, opposing its motion.

3. The assertion that the net force is zero (choice d) is incorrect because the puck is decelerating, which means there is a net force acting on it. Similarly, the assertion that the net force is down (choice b) is incorrect because the vertical forces (gravity and the normal force) cancel each other out. The assertion that the net force is in the positive direction (choice c) is also incorrect because the puck is slowing down, not speeding up.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, the electric field is defined as the force per unit charge, \( E = F / q \). It is a property of the source producing the field and does not depend on the magnitude of the test charge used to measure it.

Next, if experimenter A uses a test charge \( q_0 \), the force experienced by the charge is \( F_A = q_0 \cdot E \). Similarly, if experimenter B uses a test charge \( 2q_0 \), the force experienced is \( F_B = 2q_0 \cdot E \). However, when calculating the electric field, both experimenters divide the force by their respective test charges, resulting in the same value for \( E \).

Finally, since the electric field is independent of the test charge used, both experimenters will measure the same electric field.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the forces acting on the objects step by step:

1. Initially, the gravitational force and the electrostatic force between the two objects are equal. The gravitational force is given by \( F_g = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \), and the electrostatic force is given by \( F_e = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \), where \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses, \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) are the charges, \( r \) is the distance between the objects, and \( G \) and \( k \) are constants. Since the forces are equal, we have:
   \[
   G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}.
   \]

2. Simplifying the equation, we get:
   \[
   G m_1 m_2 = k q_1 q_2.
   \]

3. If the mass of Object A (\( m_1 \)) is halved, the gravitational force will decrease. To maintain equilibrium, the electrostatic force must also decrease proportionally. Since the electrostatic force depends on the product of the charges (\( q_1 q_2 \)), we need to adjust one of the charges to compensate.

4. If the charge on Object B (\( q_2 \)) is halved, the product \( q_1 q_2 \) will decrease by the same factor as the gravitational force (due to the halving of \( m_1 \)). This will maintain equilibrium.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to determine the voltage of the battery. The charge \( Q \) on the original 2 μF capacitor is 600 μC, and the capacitance \( C \) is 2 μF. Using the formula \( Q = CV \), the voltage \( V \) of the battery is \( V = Q / C = 600 \, \mu C / 2 \, \mu F = 300 \, V \).

Next, I calculate the equivalent capacitance of the three 18 μF capacitors in series. For capacitors in series, the equivalent capacitance \( C_{eq} \) is given by:
\[
\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \frac{1}{C_3}
\]
Since all three capacitors have the same capacitance of 18 μF:
\[
\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{18} + \frac{1}{18} + \frac{1}{18} = \frac{3}{18} = \frac{1}{6}
\]
Thus, \( C_{eq} = 6 \, \mu F \).

Now, I calculate the total charge stored in the equivalent capacitance when connected to the 300 V battery. Using \( Q = C_{eq} V \):
\[
Q = 6 \, \mu F \cdot 300 \, V = 1800 \, \mu C
\]
This is the total charge stored in the series combination of capacitors.

Finally, I determine the charge on each individual capacitor. In a series connection, the charge on each capacitor is the same as the total charge stored in the series combination. Therefore, the charge on each capacitor is \( 1800 \, \mu C \).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will use the relationship between the rate of change of kinetic energy and force. 

1. The rate of change of kinetic energy is given as –6.0 J/s. The formula for the rate of change of kinetic energy is \( \frac{dK}{dt} = F \cdot v \), where \( F \) is the force and \( v \) is the velocity.
2. Rearrange the formula to solve for \( F \): \( F = \frac{\frac{dK}{dt}}{v} \).
3. Substitute the given values: \( \frac{dK}{dt} = -6.0 \, \text{J/s} \) (magnitude is 6.0 J/s) and \( v = 3.0 \, \text{m/s} \). Thus, \( F = \frac{6.0}{3.0} = 2.0 \, \text{N} \).

The magnitude of the force is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the forces acting on the car step by step:

1. The car is rounding a banked curve, so the centripetal force required for circular motion must point toward the center of the curve. This force is responsible for keeping the car in its circular path.

2. The forces acting on the car are:
   - The weight of the car, which acts vertically downward.
   - The normal force from the road, which acts perpendicular to the surface of the banked curve.
   - The friction force, which acts parallel to the surface of the road and can have a component toward the center of the curve.

3. The centripetal force is not provided by any single force in this case. Instead, it is the horizontal component of the normal force combined with the horizontal component of the friction force that provides the required centripetal force.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to calculate the vertical velocity of the stone after 4 seconds. The vertical velocity is given by \( v_y = g \cdot t \), where \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (acceleration due to gravity) and \( t = 4 \, \text{seconds} \). So, \( v_y = 9.8 \cdot 4 = 39.2 \, \text{m/s} \).

Next, the horizontal velocity remains constant throughout the motion because there is no air resistance. The horizontal velocity is \( v_x = 30 \, \text{m/s} \).

Finally, to find the total speed of the stone when it enters the water, I use the Pythagorean theorem: \( v_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} \). Substituting the values, \( v_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{30^2 + 39.2^2} = \sqrt{900 + 1536.64} = \sqrt{2436.64} \approx 49.36 \, \text{m/s} \).

The closest answer is 50 m/s. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I will use the formula for gravitational force: \( F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \), where \( F \) is the gravitational force, \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses of the two objects, and \( r \) is the distance between their centers.

1. Initially, the force is \( F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \).
2. If the mass of each object is doubled, the new masses become \( 2m_1 \) and \( 2m_2 \). Substituting these into the formula, the numerator becomes \( (2m_1)(2m_2) = 4m_1m_2 \).
3. If the distance between the centers is also doubled, the denominator becomes \( (2r)^2 = 4r^2 \).
4. The new force is \( F' = G \frac{4m_1m_2}{4r^2} \). Simplifying, \( F' = G \frac{m_1m_2}{r^2} \), which is the same as the original force.

Therefore, the gravitational force remains the same. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to use the formula for electrical power: Power (P) = Voltage (V) × Current (I). Rearranging the formula to solve for current, I = P / V.  
Next, substitute the given values: P = 60 W and V = 120 V. So, I = 60 / 120 = 0.5 A.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I will use the ideal gas law: \( PV = nRT \), where \( P \) is pressure, \( V \) is volume, \( n \) is the number of moles, \( R \) is the gas constant, and \( T \) is temperature.

1. Initially, the pressure \( P \) is proportional to \( T/V \) (since \( n \) and \( R \) are constants). If the temperature is increased by a factor of 2, \( T \) becomes \( 2T \). If the volume is increased by a factor of 8, \( V \) becomes \( 8V \).

2. Substituting these changes into the proportionality \( P \propto T/V \), the new pressure becomes proportional to \( (2T)/(8V) = T/(4V) \).

3. Comparing the new pressure to the original pressure, the pressure decreases by a factor of 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the properties of light as it transitions between mediums. The frequency of light remains constant when it moves from one medium to another because it is determined by the source of the light.

Next, the speed of light changes when it enters a medium with a different refractive index. In this case, the speed of light decreases as it enters the glass from the air.

Finally, since the speed of light changes and the frequency remains constant, the wavelength of the light must also change to maintain the relationship \( v = f \lambda \), where \( v \) is the speed, \( f \) is the frequency, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the situation. The process is isochoric, meaning the volume of the gas remains constant throughout the process. Therefore, any statement about the volume increasing would be incorrect.

Next, when the temperature of an ideal gas increases, the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, which also leads to an increase in the average speed of the molecules. This is consistent with the kinetic theory of gases.

Additionally, for an ideal gas in an isochoric process, an increase in temperature results in an increase in pressure, as described by the ideal gas law \( P \propto T \) when volume is constant.

Finally, since the volume does not change in an isochoric process, the statement ""The volume increases"" is NOT true.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. Standing waves occur when the length of the string is a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave. If standing waves are not observed, it means the condition for resonance is not satisfied. This suggests that the string length is not a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave.

2. The wave speed on the string is determined by the tension and linear mass density of the string, and it is fixed for a given setup. However, this does not directly explain why standing waves are not observed.

3. The frequency of 60 Hz being in the lowest range of audible sound is irrelevant to the formation of standing waves. The formation of standing waves depends on the relationship between the string length, wavelength, and frequency, not on whether the sound is audible.

4. The wavelength of the wave produced by the speaker is indeed equal to the wave speed divided by the frequency (v = fλ). However, this does not explain why standing waves are not formed. The key issue is the relationship between the string length and the wavelength.

The correct explanation is that the string length is not a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave.

{'sol': 'a'}"
"To solve this, let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the charge distribution**: The charge density ρ = ar varies linearly with radius r, and the charge distribution extends up to a radius R. For r > R, there is no charge distribution, so the electric field outside the sphere will behave as if all the charge is concentrated at the center (Gauss's law).

2. **Electric field inside the sphere (r < R)**: Using Gauss's law, the electric field at a distance r from the center depends on the enclosed charge. The enclosed charge Q_enc is obtained by integrating the charge density over the volume:
   \[
   Q_{\text{enc}} = \int_0^r \rho \cdot 4\pi r'^2 dr' = \int_0^r (a r') \cdot 4\pi r'^2 dr' = 4\pi a \int_0^r r'^3 dr' = 4\pi a \frac{r^4}{4} = \pi a r^4.
   \]
   The electric field is then:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{r^2} = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{\pi a r^4}{r^2} = \frac{a r^2}{4\epsilon_0}.
   \]
   This shows that the electric field increases non-linearly (quadratically) with r for r < R.

3. **Electric field outside the sphere (r > R)**: For r > R, the total charge Q_total is constant and equal to the charge enclosed within the sphere of radius R:
   \[
   Q_{\text{total}} = \pi a R^4.
   \]
   The electric field outside the sphere is:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{Q_{\text{total}}}{r^2} = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{\pi a R^4}{r^2}.
   \]
   This shows that the electric field decreases with \(1/r^2\) for r > R.

4. **Analyze the options**:
   - (a) ""It increases as r approaches infinity"": Incorrect, as the electric field decreases for r > R.
   - (b) ""It decreases linearly for r > R"": Incorrect, as the electric field decreases with \(1/r^2\), not linearly.
   - (c) ""It increases linearly for r > R"": Incorrect, as the electric field decreases for r > R.
   - (d) ""It increases non-linearly for r < R"": Correct, as the electric field increases quadratically (non-linearly) with r for r < R.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the Doppler effect, which describes the change in frequency of a wave in relation to an observer moving relative to the source of the wave. In this case, the alarm is moving away from the observer as it falls.

Next, when the source of the sound (the alarm) moves away from the observer, the observed frequency decreases because the sound waves are stretched out, leading to a lower pitch.

Finally, as the alarm continues to fall, its speed increases due to gravity, which causes the frequency to decrease further over time.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the geometric factors influencing the rate of heat transfer along the rod, we need to consider the formula for heat conduction. The rate of heat transfer \( Q \) through a material is given by Fourier's law:

\[
Q = \frac{k \cdot A \cdot \Delta T}{\ell}
\]

where:
- \( k \) is the thermal conductivity of the material,
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the rod,
- \( \Delta T \) is the temperature difference between the two ends,
- \( \ell \) is the length of the rod.

Step 1: Analyze the role of the cross-sectional area \( A \). The cross-sectional area of the rod is proportional to the square of its radius \( Q \) (\( A = \pi Q^2 \)). A larger area allows more heat to flow through the rod, increasing the rate of heat transfer.

Step 2: Analyze the role of the length \( \ell \). The length of the rod inversely affects the rate of heat transfer. A longer rod increases the distance over which heat must travel, reducing the rate of heat transfer.

Step 3: Combine the effects. Both the cross-sectional area and the length of the rod are geometric factors that influence the rate of heat transfer. Therefore, the correct answer is that both the length and area affect the heat transfer rate.

Final answer: {'sol': 'c'}"
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. The prescription of -5 diopters indicates a diverging lens, as negative diopters correspond to lenses that spread light rays apart. Diverging lenses create virtual images.

2. The focal length \( f \) of a lens is related to its power \( P \) in diopters by the formula \( f = \frac{1}{P} \), where \( f \) is in meters. For \( P = -5 \), \( f = \frac{1}{-5} = -0.2 \) meters, or -20 cm. The negative sign indicates that the focal point is on the same side as the object.

3. For distant objects (effectively at infinity), the image formed by a diverging lens will be a virtual image located at the focal point of the lens. Since the focal length is -20 cm, the image will be upright, virtual, and located 20 cm in front of the eyes.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The nonconducting sphere has a net positive charge, +Q. When it is brought near the neutral conducting sphere, the electric field from the charged sphere will cause the free electrons in the conducting sphere to redistribute. Specifically, the electrons in the conducting sphere will be attracted toward the side closer to the charged sphere, leaving the far side positively charged. This is called charge polarization.

2. Since the conducting sphere remains neutral overall (no net charge is added or removed), it does not develop a net charge of –Q. Instead, it has a separation of charges: the side closer to the charged sphere becomes negatively charged, and the far side becomes positively charged.

3. The interaction between the positively charged nonconducting sphere and the negatively charged side of the conducting sphere will result in an attractive force. This is because opposite charges attract, and the induced negative charges are closer to the charged sphere than the induced positive charges.

4. An electric field is not induced *within* the conducting sphere because the charges in a conductor redistribute themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero in electrostatic equilibrium.

Based on this reasoning:
- Option a) is incorrect because there is no electric field inside the conducting sphere.
- Option b) is incorrect because the conducting sphere does not develop a net charge of –Q; it remains neutral overall.
- Option c) is correct because the spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction due to charge polarization.
- Option d) is incorrect because the spheres will not repel; they attract due to the induced charges.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The magnetic force on a charged particle moving through a magnetic field is given by the formula:  
   \( F = qvB \sin\theta \),  
   where \( q \) is the charge, \( v \) is the velocity, \( B \) is the magnetic field strength, and \( \theta \) is the angle between the velocity and the magnetic field.

2. In this problem, the new particles have twice the charge (\( 2q \)), twice the velocity (\( 2v \)), and the magnetic field (\( B \)) and angle (\( \theta \)) remain unchanged. Substituting these changes into the formula:  
   \( F_{\text{new}} = (2q)(2v)B \sin\theta = 4(qvB \sin\theta) = 4F \).

3. The mass of the particle does not affect the magnetic force, so it does not influence the calculation.

Thus, the new force is 4 times the original force.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's proceed step by step:

1. **Understand the setup**: The electric dipole consists of two charges, +4.0 nC and -4.0 nC, separated by a distance of 2.0 cm. The point of interest is midway between the charges.

2. **Electric field due to a point charge**: The electric field due to a single point charge is given by \( E = \frac{k |q|}{r^2} \), where \( k = 9.0 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( q \) is the charge, and \( r \) is the distance from the charge to the point of interest.

3. **Distance to the midpoint**: Since the charges are separated by 2.0 cm, the distance from each charge to the midpoint is \( r = 1.0 \, \text{cm} = 0.01 \, \text{m} \).

4. **Calculate the electric field from each charge**: The magnitude of the electric field at the midpoint due to each charge is:
   \[
   E = \frac{(9.0 \times 10^9)(4.0 \times 10^{-9})}{(0.01)^2} = \frac{36.0 \times 10^0}{1.0 \times 10^{-4}} = 3.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{V/m}.
   \]

5. **Direction of the fields**: The electric field due to the positive charge points away from the charge, while the field due to the negative charge points toward the charge. At the midpoint, these fields are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, so they cancel each other out.

6. **Resultant field**: Since the fields cancel, the net electric field at the midpoint is zero.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, I will use Coulomb's law, which states that the magnitude of the electric force between two charges is given by:

\[ F = k \cdot \frac{|q_1 \cdot q_2|}{r^2} \]

1. The force on particle A due to particle B is the same as the force on particle B due to particle A because of Newton's third law (action-reaction forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction). Therefore, the magnitudes of the forces on A and B are equal.

2. Since the forces are equal in magnitude, the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on A to that on B is 1:1.

3. Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The energy of a wave is directly related to its amplitude (height). A higher wave height corresponds to more energy, while a smaller wave height corresponds to less energy.
2. As the wave travels across the pond, it loses energy due to factors like friction and spreading out over a larger area.
3. The observation that directly indicates a decrease in energy is the reduction in the wave's height, as energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the situation described. The tennis ball is dropped and falls 6 meters, and the velocity measured by the photogate is lower than the predicted velocity by 20%. This suggests that the ball is not accelerating as expected under ideal conditions.

Next, I analyze the choices. Option a) ""The ball changes its shape while falling"" is unlikely to cause a significant difference in velocity. Option b) ""The acceleration of gravity varies as the ball is falling"" is incorrect because the acceleration due to gravity is constant near the Earth's surface. Option c) ""Air resistance increases the acceleration of the ball"" is incorrect because air resistance opposes motion and decreases acceleration. Option d) ""The acceleration of the ball varies with the velocity"" is correct because air resistance depends on velocity and reduces the net acceleration as the ball speeds up.

Finally, I conclude that the most plausible explanation for the large percent difference is air resistance, which causes the acceleration of the ball to vary with velocity.

{'sol': 'd'}"
"To solve this, I will use Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period of a planet (in Earth years) is proportional to the cube of its average distance from the sun (in AU).

1. Mercury's orbital period is given as one-fifth of an Earth year, so \( T = 1/5 \) years.
2. According to Kepler's third law, \( T^2 = R^3 \), where \( R \) is the distance in AU. Substituting \( T = 1/5 \), we get:
   \[
   (1/5)^2 = R^3
   \]
   \[
   1/25 = R^3
   \]
3. To find \( R \), take the cube root of \( 1/25 \):
   \[
   R = \sqrt[3]{1/25}
   \]
   Approximating, \( R \) is closest to \( 1/9 \) AU.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the forces acting on a person in the Gravitron ride:

1. The person is pressed against the wall due to the centripetal force provided by the normal force \( F_N \) from the wall. The centripetal force is given by \( F_N = \frac{mv^2}{R} \), where \( m \) is the mass of the person, \( v \) is the tangential speed, and \( R \) is the radius of the ride.

2. The force of friction \( F_f \) between the person's clothing and the wall prevents the person from sliding down. The maximum frictional force is \( F_f = \mu F_N \), where \( \mu \) is the coefficient of friction.

3. For the person to not fall, the frictional force must balance the gravitational force \( F_g = mg \). Thus, \( F_f = mg \).

4. Substituting \( F_f = \mu F_N \) and \( F_N = \frac{mv^2}{R} \), we get:
   \[
   \mu \frac{mv^2}{R} = mg
   \]

5. Simplify to solve for \( m \), the mass of the person:
   \[
   m = \frac{\mu v^2}{Rg}
   \]

Thus, the greatest mass that a person can have to safely go on the ride is given by \( m = \frac{\mu v^2}{Rg} \).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. Initially, the satellite is in a circular orbit, meaning its speed is constant and perfectly balanced with the gravitational force providing the centripetal force. The orbit is stable.

2. When the meteor collides with the satellite, it increases the satellite's speed by 1%. This increase in speed disrupts the balance between the gravitational force and the centripetal force. The satellite now has more kinetic energy than required for a circular orbit at its current radius.

3. As a result, the satellite transitions to an elliptical orbit. In an elliptical orbit, the point where the speed was increased (point P) becomes the closest approach to Earth (the periapsis), because the satellite's increased speed at P causes it to move outward to a farther distance before slowing down and returning.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
