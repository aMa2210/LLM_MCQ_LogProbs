answer
"First, I need to calculate the total revenue generated in a year. If the limousine is rented for 2 hours a day at $245 per hour, the daily revenue is 2 * $245 = $490. Over a year (365 days), the total revenue is $490 * 365 = $178,850.

Next, I need to calculate the total costs for the year. The daily cost is $50, so the yearly cost is $50 * 365 = $18,250.

Now, I calculate the net profit for the year by subtracting the yearly costs from the yearly revenue: $178,850 - $18,250 = $160,600.

Finally, I calculate the yield on investment by dividing the net profit by the initial investment and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage: ($160,600 / $98,000) * 100 ≈ 164%.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. The merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory, which means the assets (inventory) are properly recorded and not understated. Therefore, there is no effect on assets.

2. However, the credit purchase was not recorded, which means the corresponding liability (accounts payable) was not recorded. This results in liabilities being understated.

3. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that there is no effect on assets, but liabilities are understated.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze the definitions of sampling risk and nonsampling risk. Sampling risk arises from the possibility that the sample selected is not representative of the population, leading to incorrect conclusions. Nonsampling risk arises from human error, such as failing to recognize a misstatement.

Next, I will evaluate each option:
a) This describes sampling risk, but it incorrectly attributes it to nonsampling risk. Therefore, this is incorrect.
b) This correctly describes nonsampling risk, as it arises from errors like failing to recognize misstatements. This is a valid statement.
c) Sampling risk is not about applying audit procedures to specific risks but about the representativeness of the sample. This is incorrect.
d) Sampling risk does not involve selecting inappropriate audit procedures; that would be a different type of error. This is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: Inspecting inventory items ordered before the year-end but arriving after the year-end is not directly related to identifying subsequent events. This procedure is more related to verifying inventory cutoff or completeness, not subsequent events.

2. **Option b**: Testing internal control activities previously reported as inadequate is not a procedure related to subsequent events. This would be part of evaluating the effectiveness of internal controls, not identifying events occurring after the balance sheet date.

3. **Option c**: Reviewing the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year-end is a procedure related to cash and bank reconciliations, not specifically to identifying subsequent events.

4. **Option d**: Comparing the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited is a common procedure to identify subsequent events. This comparison helps the auditor identify any significant changes or events that occurred after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of the audit report.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify the primary method by which the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) updates the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).  
Second, the FASB issues Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) to amend the ASC, which is the single source of authoritative GAAP for nongovernmental entities.  
Third, the other options, such as Emerging Issues Task Force Releases, Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, and Staff Technical Bulletins, are not the current mechanism for updating the ASC.  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To calculate the Net Present Value (NPV), I need to discount the future cash flows to their present value and subtract the initial investment.

1. The cash flows are $500 in year five and $500 in year ten. The discount rate is 10%. The formula for present value is PV = FV / (1 + r)^t, where FV is the future value, r is the discount rate, and t is the time in years.

2. For the cash flow in year five: PV = $500 / (1 + 0.10)^5 = $500 / (1.61051) ≈ $310.46.

3. For the cash flow in year ten: PV = $500 / (1 + 0.10)^10 = $500 / (2.59374) ≈ $192.31.

4. The total present value of the cash flows is $310.46 + $192.31 = $502.77.

5. Subtract the initial investment of $500: NPV = $502.77 − $500 = $2.77, which rounds to approximately $3.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Understanding the error**: Dean Co. used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method to amortize the bond premium. The straight-line method evenly spreads the premium amortization over the bond's life, while the effective interest method results in a decreasing amortization amount over time. This means that under the straight-line method, the bond carrying amount would be higher than it should be at the end of the bond's life (June 30, Year 12).

2. **Impact on bond carrying amount**: Since the straight-line method results in less premium amortization in earlier periods compared to the effective interest method, the bond carrying amount would be overstated at June 30, Year 12.

3. **Impact on retained earnings**: The error in amortization affects interest expense, which in turn affects net income and retained earnings. However, by the bond's maturity date (June 30, Year 12), the premium would have been fully amortized under both methods. Therefore, there would be no effect on retained earnings at this point.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To calculate the price of the bond, I will use the present value formula for each cash flow (coupons and face value) and discount them at the yield rate of 6%.

1. The bond pays annual coupons of 5% of the face value, which is $100. Therefore, the annual coupon payment is $5.
2. The bond matures in three years, so there are three coupon payments of $5 each and a face value repayment of $100 at the end of year 3.
3. The present value of each cash flow is calculated using the formula: PV = Cash Flow / (1 + yield)^n, where n is the year of the cash flow.

- For the first coupon: PV = $5 / (1 + 0.06)^1 = $5 / 1.06 ≈ $4.72.
- For the second coupon: PV = $5 / (1 + 0.06)^2 = $5 / 1.1236 ≈ $4.45.
- For the third coupon: PV = $5 / (1 + 0.06)^3 = $5 / 1.191016 ≈ $4.20.
- For the face value: PV = $100 / (1 + 0.06)^3 = $100 / 1.191016 ≈ $83.38.

4. Add up all the present values: $4.72 + $4.45 + $4.20 + $83.38 ≈ $96.71.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze each choice step by step:

1. **Choice a: It will be reclassified as an asset held for sale.**  
   When a company decides to sell an asset and meets the criteria for ""held for sale"" under accounting standards, the asset is reclassified as ""held for sale."" This is correct.

2. **Choice b: It will be classified as a current asset.**  
   Assets held for sale are typically classified as current assets because they are expected to be sold within one year. This is correct.

3. **Choice c: It will no longer be depreciated.**  
   Once an asset is classified as ""held for sale,"" depreciation stops because the asset is no longer being used in operations. This is correct.

4. **Choice d: It will be valued at historical cost.**  
   Assets held for sale are not valued at historical cost. Instead, they are valued at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. This statement is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to determine Carson's share of the corporation's taxable income if it were an S corporation. Since Carson owns 40% of the stock, Carson would report 40% of the $400,000 taxable income, which is $400,000 × 0.40 = $160,000.

Next, I need to consider the distributions. In an S corporation, distributions are not taxed separately because the income is already passed through to the shareholders. Therefore, the $70,000 in cash dividends does not affect Carson's reported income.

Finally, Carson would report only the $160,000 of pass-through income on Carson's individual tax return.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I will use the formula for the present value of a perpetuity, which is PV = C / r, where C is the annual cash flow and r is the discount rate.

Step 1: Identify the given values. The annual cash flow (C) is $10, and the discount rate (r) is 5% or 0.05.

Step 2: Substitute the values into the formula. PV = 10 / 0.05.

Step 3: Perform the calculation. 10 ÷ 0.05 = $200.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the amount of rental losses Smith may deduct, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Understand the passive activity loss rules**: Generally, rental real estate activities are considered passive activities, and losses from passive activities can only offset passive income. However, there is an exception for individuals who actively participate in rental real estate activities. Under this exception, up to $25,000 of rental real estate losses can be deducted against non-passive income if the taxpayer's AGI is $100,000 or less.

2. **Phase-out of the $25,000 allowance**: The $25,000 allowance is reduced by 50% of the amount by which the taxpayer's AGI exceeds $100,000. Smith's AGI is $120,000, which exceeds $100,000 by $20,000. The reduction is 50% of $20,000, which equals $10,000.

3. **Calculate the allowable deduction**: The $25,000 allowance is reduced by $10,000, leaving Smith with $15,000 of allowable rental real estate losses that can be deducted against non-passive income.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify which of the choices is directly related to a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures for accounting and auditing practices. 

Next, I recognize that quality control policies and procedures for CPA firms are designed to ensure that the firm complies with professional standards and regulatory requirements. These policies typically include elements such as leadership responsibilities, ethical requirements, acceptance and continuance of client relationships, human resources, engagement performance, and monitoring.

Among the choices, ""engagement performance"" is a key element of quality control policies, as it ensures that engagements are performed in accordance with professional standards and that the firm issues appropriate reports.

The other options, such as ""risk analysis,"" ""safeguarding of assets,"" and ""information processing,"" are not specific elements of a CPA firm's quality control policies for accounting and auditing practices.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To calculate the direct labor rate variance, I will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the actual hours worked**: The company produced 9,000 units, and each unit required 2.5 hours. So, the total actual hours worked = 9,000 units × 2.5 hours/unit = 22,500 hours.

2. **Calculate the difference in the wage rate**: The standard wage rate is $20/hour, and the actual wage rate is $21/hour. The difference in the wage rate = $21 - $20 = $1/hour.

3. **Compute the direct labor rate variance**: Multiply the difference in the wage rate by the total actual hours worked. Direct labor rate variance = $1/hour × 22,500 hours = $22,500.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to calculate the GDP gap, which is the difference between the full-employment GDP and the actual GDP. The GDP gap is $1.3 trillion - $1.2 trillion = $0.1 trillion, or $100 billion.

Next, I need to determine the spending multiplier. The formula for the spending multiplier is 1 / (1 - MPC), where MPC is the marginal propensity to consume. Substituting MPC = 0.8, the multiplier is 1 / (1 - 0.8) = 1 / 0.2 = 5.

Finally, to find the required increase in government expenditures, I divide the GDP gap by the spending multiplier. The required increase is $100 billion ÷ 5 = $20 billion.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the least reliable type of audit evidence, I will evaluate each option step by step:

1. **Receivable confirmations received from the client’s customers (a):** These are external confirmations directly obtained from third parties (the client’s customers). External evidence is generally considered highly reliable.

2. **Prenumbered receiving reports completed by the client’s employees (b):** These are internal documents prepared by the client’s employees. Internal evidence is less reliable than external evidence because it is subject to the client’s control and potential bias.

3. **Prior months’ bank statements obtained from the client (c):** While these are external documents, they are obtained indirectly through the client, which reduces their reliability compared to directly obtained external evidence.

4. **Municipal property tax bills prepared in the client’s name (d):** These are external documents prepared by a third party (the municipality). External evidence is generally reliable, even if obtained indirectly.

Comparing all options, **prenumbered receiving reports completed by the client’s employees (b)** provide the least assurance of reliability because they are internal documents subject to the client’s control.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the amount to be capitalized as software cost, I need to follow these steps:

1. Costs incurred before technological feasibility is established, such as the completion of detailed program design ($10,000) and coding/testing to establish technological feasibility ($15,000), are expensed as research and development costs. These are not capitalized.

2. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established, such as other coding and testing costs ($44,000), are capitalized as software costs.

3. Therefore, the amount to be capitalized is $44,000.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to determine the appropriate action when an accountant becomes aware of a material departure from GAAP during a compilation engagement. In a compilation engagement, the accountant does not express an opinion or assurance but must disclose material departures from GAAP.

Next, I need to evaluate the choices. Issuing an adverse or qualified opinion (choice a) is not applicable in a compilation engagement because the accountant does not provide an opinion. Restricting the distribution of the financial statements (choice b) is not the correct response to a GAAP departure. Explaining the purpose of historical cost (choice d) is not relevant to the situation.

Finally, the correct action is to add a separate paragraph to the compilation report that discloses the departure from GAAP and its effects on the financial statements (choice c).

{'sol': 'c'}"
"First, I need to understand the concept of the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose under the UCC. This warranty arises when the seller knows or has reason to know the particular purpose for which the buyer intends to use the goods and also knows that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods.

Next, I need to evaluate the choices:
- Choice (a) mentions the buyer's reliance on the seller's skill or judgment but does not specify that the seller knows the buyer's particular purpose.
- Choice (b) includes the buyer's purpose and the seller being a merchant, but being a merchant is not a requirement for this warranty to arise.
- Choice (c) correctly states that the seller must know the buyer's particular purpose and that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment.
- Choice (d) includes the seller being a merchant, which is not a requirement for this warranty.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: Significant differences between forecasted financial statements and audited financial statements may indicate issues with the accuracy of forecasting but do not necessarily raise questions about management's integrity. This could be due to errors or unforeseen circumstances rather than dishonesty.

2. **Option b**: If the CPA is not permitted access to sensitive information, such as senior management salaries, this could indicate a lack of transparency or an attempt to conceal information. This raises concerns about management's integrity.

3. **Option c**: Substantial inventory write-offs before year-end over multiple years could indicate poor inventory management or valuation issues. However, this does not directly suggest a lack of integrity unless there is evidence of intentional manipulation.

4. **Option d**: The existence of related party transactions is not inherently a sign of management's lack of integrity. Related party transactions are common in business and only raise concerns if they are not disclosed or are used for fraudulent purposes.

Based on the analysis, the condition most likely to raise questions about management's integrity is the lack of access to sensitive information (option b).

"First, I need to consider the requirements of an e-commerce environment, which demands continuous availability of IT systems to ensure uninterrupted operations. 

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) focuses on written source documents, which is less relevant in a real-time e-commerce environment. Option b) emphasizes maintaining redundant systems for instant availability, which aligns with the need for continuous operations. Option c) discusses business interruption insurance, which is more about financial recovery than operational continuity. Option d) involves off-site backups, which are important but do not directly address the need for instant availability.

Finally, the most critical aspect for an e-commerce environment is ensuring instant availability, which is best addressed by maintaining redundant systems.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate step by step:

1. **Determine the profit per unit sold**:  
   Selling price per unit = $200  
   Cost per unit = $125  
   Sales commission per unit = $25  
   Profit per unit = Selling price - (Cost + Commission) = $200 - ($125 + $25) = $50.

2. **Calculate the desired profit**:  
   Let the number of units sold be \( x \).  
   Total sales revenue = \( 200x \).  
   Desired profit = 10% of sales revenue = \( 0.1 \times 200x = 20x \).

3. **Set up the equation for total profit**:  
   Total profit = Total revenue - Total costs.  
   Total costs = Fixed costs + Variable costs.  
   Variable costs = (Cost per unit + Commission per unit) \(\times x = (125 + 25)x = 150x\).  
   Total costs = $3000 + $150x.  
   Total profit = Total revenue - Total costs = \( 200x - (3000 + 150x) \).  
   Set this equal to the desired profit:  
   \( 200x - (3000 + 150x) = 20x \).

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:  
   Simplify the equation:  
   \( 200x - 3000 - 150x = 20x \).  
   \( 50x - 3000 = 20x \).  
   \( 50x - 20x = 3000 \).  
   \( 30x = 3000 \).  
   \( x = 100 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the definitions of inherent risk, control risk, and detection risk. Inherent risk and control risk are risks that exist within the entity and its environment, and they are not influenced by the auditor. Detection risk, on the other hand, is the risk that the auditor's procedures will fail to detect a material misstatement.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option a is incorrect because inherent risk and control risk are not calculated by the client; they are assessed by the auditor. Option c is incorrect because inherent risk and control risk are not controlled by the auditor; they are inherent to the entity and its environment. Option d is incorrect because inherent risk and control risk do not result from the auditor's judgment about materiality.

Finally, option b is correct because inherent risk and control risk exist independently of the audit and are not influenced by the auditor's procedures.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS) using the LIFO method step by step:

1. **Determine the total units sold**: Ultra sold 50,000 units during January.

2. **Apply the LIFO method**: Under LIFO, the most recent purchases are sold first. The most recent purchase was on 1/23 (40,000 units at $17), and the next most recent purchase was on 1/20 (30,000 units at $15). We will allocate the 50,000 units sold accordingly:
   - First, 40,000 units are sold from the 1/23 purchase at $17/unit: 40,000 × $17 = $680,000.
   - Next, 10,000 units are sold from the 1/20 purchase at $15/unit: 10,000 × $15 = $150,000.

3. **Calculate the total COGS**: Add the costs from the two layers:
   - $680,000 (from 1/23 purchase) + $150,000 (from 1/20 purchase) = $830,000.

Thus, the cost of goods sold (COGS) for January is $830,000.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine if a contract was formed under the Sales Article of the UCC, I will analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Offer and Revocation Rules under the UCC**: Jackson made an offer to sell 500 electric fans at $10 per fan and promised not to revoke the offer. Under the UCC, a merchant's firm offer (an offer in writing with a promise not to revoke) is irrevocable for the time stated or, if no time is stated, for a reasonable time not exceeding three months. Since no expiration date was stated, the offer is irrevocable for a reasonable time.

2. **Timeline of Events**: Jackson mailed the offer on day 1, and Sands received it on day 3. Jackson mailed a revocation on day 4, which Sands received on day 6. Sands mailed an acceptance on day 7, and Jackson received it on day 9. Under the UCC, an acceptance is effective upon dispatch (the ""mailbox rule""), provided it is properly sent.

3. **Application of the Mailbox Rule**: Sands' acceptance was effective when mailed on day 7, before Sands received the revocation on day 6. Therefore, the revocation was ineffective because the acceptance was already dispatched.

Based on this analysis, a contract was formed on the day Sands mailed the acceptance to Jackson. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the vacation expense for the year**:  
   - Each employee earns vacation rights during the year. The first employee earns $600 per week and is entitled to 2 weeks of vacation, so their vacation expense is $600 × 2 = $1200.  
   - The second employee earns $800 per week and is also entitled to 2 weeks of vacation, so their vacation expense is $800 × 2 = $1600.  
   - Total vacation expense for the year = $1200 + $1600 = $2800.

2. **Determine the vacation liability at year-end**:  
   - The first employee took their 2 weeks of vacation, so there is no remaining liability for them.  
   - The second employee did not take any vacation, so their unused vacation liability is $800 × 2 = $1600.  
   - Total vacation liability at year-end = $1600.

3. **Match the liability and expense to the choices**:  
   - Liability = $1600, Expense = $2800.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze each statement to determine its accuracy regarding the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA).

a) This statement is incorrect because employees who resign are generally not eligible for unemployment benefits unless they can prove they had a valid reason for resigning (e.g., unsafe working conditions).

b) This statement is incorrect because the federal unemployment system is funded solely by employer taxes under FUTA, not by employee contributions.

c) This statement is incorrect because the Act is designed to assist workers who are temporarily unemployed and actively seeking work, not those who are permanently out of work.

d) This statement is correct because while FUTA establishes the framework for unemployment insurance, the system is administered by individual states through their own employment laws.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the proper tax treatment of the sale, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Initial Contribution and Built-in Gain**: When Acre contributed the land, its fair market value was $100,000, and its tax basis was $60,000. This means there was a built-in gain of $40,000 at the time of contribution. Under partnership tax rules, this built-in gain must be allocated to the contributing partner (Acre) when the property is sold.

2. **Sale of the Land**: The land was sold for $160,000. The total gain on the sale is calculated as the sale price ($160,000) minus the tax basis ($60,000), resulting in a total gain of $100,000.

3. **Allocation of the Gain**: The first $40,000 of the gain corresponds to the built-in gain and must be allocated to Acre. The remaining $60,000 of gain is shared equally among the three partners, as specified in the partnership agreement.

Thus, the correct tax treatment is that the first $40,000 of gain is allocated to Acre, and the remaining $60,000 is shared equally by all three partners.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a)** This option refers to ensuring personnel are adequately trained, which is related to staff competence and training policies, not specifically to client acceptance or continuation decisions. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.

2. **Option b)** This option addresses minimizing the likelihood of associating with clients whose management lacks integrity, which is a key purpose of quality control policies and procedures for client acceptance and continuation. This aligns with the objective of maintaining the firm's reputation and ensuring ethical standards.

3. **Option c)** This option refers to documenting matters required to be communicated to the audit committee, which is related to audit procedures and reporting, not client acceptance or continuation decisions. Thus, this is not the correct answer.

4. **Option d)** This option refers to enhancing the auditor's understanding of the client's business and industry, which is part of the planning phase of an audit, not specifically related to client acceptance or continuation decisions. Hence, this is not the correct answer.

"To determine Vital Corp.'s taxable income, we need to adjust the book income for items that are not taxable or deductible for federal income tax purposes. Let's go step by step:

1. **Start with the book income before federal income taxes**: $500,000.

2. **Adjust for the state franchise tax refund**: The $50,000 state franchise tax refund is taxable for federal income tax purposes. Since it is already included in the book income, no adjustment is needed.

3. **Adjust for municipal bond interest income**: The $7,500 municipal bond interest income is tax-exempt for federal income tax purposes. Therefore, we subtract $7,500 from the book income.

4. **Calculate taxable income**: $500,000 - $7,500 = $492,500.

Thus, the taxable income is $492,500.

"To determine the correct source of professional guidance, I will analyze the situation step by step:

1. The scenario involves a practitioner expressing an opinion on management's assertion about the square footage of a warehouse. This is not a financial statement audit or review but rather an attestation engagement where the practitioner evaluates and provides assurance on a specific assertion made by management.

2. Statements on Auditing Standards (SAS) apply to audits of financial statements, which is not the case here. Therefore, option (a) is not applicable.

3. Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) provide guidance for engagements where a practitioner is engaged to issue an examination, review, or agreed-upon procedures report on subject matter or an assertion about subject matter that is the responsibility of another party. This aligns with the scenario described, as the practitioner is expressing an opinion on management's assertion about the square footage.

4. Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS) apply to the preparation, compilation, and review of financial statements, which is not relevant to this situation. Thus, option (c) is not applicable.

5. Statements on Standards for Consulting Services (SSCS) apply to consulting engagements, which involve providing advice or assistance rather than assurance. This does not fit the scenario, so option (d) is not applicable.

Based on this analysis, the correct source of professional guidance is the Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE).

"To determine which segments require separate disclosure, we need to apply the quantitative thresholds for reportable segments under IFRS or US GAAP. These thresholds are based on revenue, profit or loss, and assets. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Revenue Test**: A segment's revenue must be at least 10% of the total revenue of all segments. Total revenue is $177, so 10% is $17.7. Segment A has $42, Segment B has $121, and Segment C has $14. Segments A and B meet this threshold, but Segment C does not.

2. **Profit or Loss Test**: A segment's absolute profit or loss must be at least 10% of the greater of (a) the total profits of all profitable segments or (b) the total losses of all loss-making segments. Total profit is $77 (A: $12 + B: $65), and total loss is $3 (C: -$3). The greater of these is $77, so 10% is $7.7. Segment A ($12) and Segment B ($65) meet this threshold, but Segment C (-$3) does not.

3. **Assets Test**: A segment's assets must be at least 10% of the total assets of all segments. Total assets are $1,350, so 10% is $135. Segment A has $470, Segment B has $800, and Segment C has $80. Segments A and B meet this threshold, but Segment C does not.

Based on these tests, only Segments A and B meet the criteria for separate disclosure.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the scenario where there is a change in accounting principles, but the effect on the comparability of the financial statements is not material. In such cases, the auditor's primary concern is whether the change is significant enough to warrant disclosure in the audit report.

Next, since the effect is not material, the auditor does not need to emphasize the change in the audit report. The change does not impact the overall fairness of the financial statements in a way that would require additional attention.

Finally, the auditor would not need to explicitly state whether the change conforms with GAAP unless the change is material or significant. Therefore, the auditor would not refer to the change in the report.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Agency and Incompetence**: When a principal (Frost) is declared incompetent in a judicial proceeding, the agency relationship typically terminates because the principal can no longer provide consent or direction. This means Long's authority to act on Frost's behalf would generally end upon Frost's incompetence.

2. **Long's Authority**: Long had express authority to place purchase orders on Frost's behalf. However, this authority would have been terminated when Frost was declared incompetent, even though Long and Grant were unaware of the incompetence.

3. **Liability to Grant**: Since Long's authority was terminated due to Frost's incompetence, neither Frost nor Frost's legal representative would be liable to Grant. The lack of knowledge by Long and Grant does not change the fact that the agency relationship had ended.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify the factor that directly relates to assessing an internal auditor's competence. Competence is typically associated with qualifications, skills, and experience.

Next, I analyze the choices:
- a) The reporting status of the internal auditor within the organization relates more to independence than competence.
- b) The educational level and professional experiences of the internal auditor directly relate to competence, as they reflect the auditor's qualifications and ability to perform their duties.
- c) Policies prohibiting the internal auditor from auditing areas where relatives are employed relate to independence and objectivity, not competence.
- d) Oversight of employment decisions by the board or audit committee relates to governance and independence, not directly to competence.

Finally, the factor most relevant to assessing competence is the educational level and professional experiences of the internal auditor.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the choices step by step:

1. **Choice a**: Confirming with the client's lawyer about litigation is typically done closer to the end of the audit or after the balance sheet date, as it involves assessing contingencies and subsequent events. This is not a procedure most likely performed *before* the balance sheet date.

2. **Choice b**: Obtaining an understanding of the client's internal control activities is a key step in the planning phase of the audit, which occurs before substantive testing and before the balance sheet date. This is a procedure most likely performed before the balance sheet date.

3. **Choice c**: Determining liens or encumbrances on assets pledged as collateral is part of substantive testing, which is typically performed closer to or after the balance sheet date. This is less likely to be performed *before* the balance sheet date.

4. **Choice d**: Considering the client's plans and ability to meet purchase commitments and cash flow obligations is part of going concern evaluation, which is typically done later in the audit process, closer to or after the balance sheet date.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to calculate the weights of Securities A and C in the portfolio. Since it is an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has a weight of 50%.

Next, I calculate the expected return of the portfolio by multiplying the weight of each security by its expected return and summing the results:
(50% * 7%) + (50% * 5%) = 3.5% + 2.5% = 6%.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the component cost of preferred stock, we use the formula:  
Cost of Preferred Stock = Dividend / Market Price  

Step 1: Identify the given values.  
The annual dividend is $10, and the current market price of the preferred stock is $96.  

Step 2: Plug the values into the formula.  
Cost of Preferred Stock = $10 / $96 = 0.1042 or 10.42%.  

Step 3: Match the closest option.  
The closest option to 10.42% is 10.4%.  

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The city made a payment of $5000 interest and $20000 principal on its general obligation bonds. These payments were made from the debt service fund.
2. The cash used for the payment was transferred earlier in the year from the general fund to the debt service fund. The general fund does not directly report the expenditures; instead, it reports the transfer of funds to the debt service fund.
3. The debt service fund is responsible for reporting the expenditures related to the payment of interest and principal on the bonds. Therefore, the debt service fund will report the total expenditure of $25000 ($5000 interest + $20000 principal).
4. The permanent fund is not involved in this transaction, so it will report $0.

Thus, the correct reporting is:
- General fund: $0 (only reports the transfer, not the expenditure),
- Debt service fund: $25000 (reports the total expenditure),
- Permanent fund: $0 (not involved).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to determine the gain on the exchange. The gain is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the asset received (machinery) and the book value of the asset given up (land).

Next, the book value of the land is its original cost, which is $20,000. The fair value of the machinery received is $55,000. The gain is calculated as $55,000 (fair value of machinery) - $20,000 (book value of land) = $35,000.

Since the transaction has commercial substance, the entire gain is recognized.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to calculate the present value (PV) of the $2 million that will be received in five years. The formula for PV is:  
PV = Future Value / (1 + discount rate)^number of years.  

Next, substituting the values:  
PV = $2,000,000 / (1 + 0.10)^5 = $2,000,000 / (1.61051) ≈ $1,242,000.  

Now, I subtract the initial investment cost of $1,000,000 from the PV to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV):  
NPV = $1,242,000 - $1,000,000 = $242,000.  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine Brown's liability on the note, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Understanding the role of a cosigner**: A cosigner, like Brown, guarantees the payment of the note if the primary obligor (Royal) fails to pay. The cosigner's liability is generally independent of the primary obligor's ability to pay or legal status.

2. **Effect of Royal's mental incompetency**: If Royal is adjudicated mentally incompetent, this may affect Royal's ability to fulfill the obligation. However, this does not automatically discharge the cosigner's liability. The cosigner (Brown) remains liable to the creditor (State Bank) unless there is a specific legal provision or agreement that states otherwise.

3. **Brown's liability**: As a cosigner, Brown is directly liable to pay the note when it becomes due, regardless of Royal's mental incompetency. State Bank does not need to first seek payment from Royal before pursuing Brown.

Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine when the recognition of rental expense should begin, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the nature of an operating lease**: Under an operating lease, rental expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, starting from when the lessee has the right to use the leased asset.

2. **Identify when the company gains control of the property**: The company receives control of the property on January 1, which is when it can begin making leasehold improvements. This is typically when the lease term begins, even if the space is not yet occupied or rental payments have not started.

3. **Determine the start of rental expense recognition**: Rental expense recognition begins when the lessee has control of the property and the lease term has commenced. In this case, the lease term begins on January 1, when the company gains control of the property.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate each choice to determine which circumstance would most likely cause an auditor to suspect material misstatements.

a) Unusual discrepancies between the entity's records and confirmation replies could indicate potential errors or fraud, which may lead to material misstatements. This is a strong indicator of potential issues.

b) Management enforcing strict budgetary controls over departmental supervisors is a sign of good internal control and would not typically lead to suspicion of material misstatements.

c) Cash transactions being electronically processed and recorded without a paper audit trail could pose challenges for auditing but does not directly indicate material misstatements.

d) Large outstanding checks in the monthly bank reconciliation are common and do not necessarily indicate material misstatements unless there are other red flags.

The most likely circumstance to cause suspicion of material misstatements is unusual discrepancies between records and confirmation replies. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the number of gifts made for gift tax purposes, let's analyze step by step:

1. The taxpayer owns the insurance contract and pays the premiums. When the taxpayer designates beneficiaries (in this case, the two children), the act of paying the premiums is considered a transfer of property for gift tax purposes.

2. Each premium payment is treated as a gift to the beneficiaries because the taxpayer is providing a benefit to them (the death benefit of the insurance policy).

3. Since there are two children designated as equal beneficiaries, each premium payment is considered two separate gifts—one to each child.

Thus, for each premium payment, two gifts of property are made for gift tax purposes. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct fund type for reporting the donated land, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Understand the nature of the donation and its purpose**: The land was donated to the city by a local farmer specifically for the construction of windmills, which are intended to generate electrical power. The utility revenues from the windmills will offset all associated expenses, indicating that the windmills will operate as a self-sustaining activity.

2. **Identify the appropriate fund type**: Since the windmills are intended to generate revenue and operate like a business, the activity aligns with the characteristics of an enterprise fund. Enterprise funds are used to account for operations that are financed and operated in a manner similar to private businesses, where the intent is to recover costs through user charges.

3. **Conclusion**: The donated land should be reported in the enterprise fund because it is directly associated with the windmill operations, which are intended to be self-sustaining through utility revenues.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to calculate the gain from the sale of the residence. The gain is the selling price minus the cost basis. The selling price is $500,000, and the cost basis is $200,000. Therefore, the gain is $500,000 - $200,000 = $300,000.

Next, I need to determine if Decker qualifies for the exclusion of gain on the sale of a principal residence. Since Decker owned and occupied the house as his principal residence for at least 2 of the last 5 years, he qualifies for the exclusion. As a single individual, Decker can exclude up to $250,000 of the gain.

Finally, I subtract the exclusion amount from the total gain to determine the recognized gain. The total gain is $300,000, and the exclusion is $250,000. Therefore, the recognized gain is $300,000 - $250,000 = $50,000.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the nature of cumulative preferred stock. Cumulative preferred stock ensures that if a company does not pay dividends in a given year, those unpaid dividends accumulate and must be paid out before any dividends can be paid to common stockholders.

Next, I need to evaluate the options:
a) Conversion of preferred stock into common stock is not a guaranteed right for cumulative preferred stockholders unless explicitly stated in the terms of the stock.
b) Voting rights are typically not granted to preferred stockholders unless specified, as preferred stockholders usually have limited or no voting rights.
c) Dividend carryovers from years in which dividends were not paid is a defining feature of cumulative preferred stock, ensuring that missed dividends are eventually paid.
d) Guaranteed dividends are not a feature of cumulative preferred stock, as dividends depend on the company's profitability and board decisions.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the key restriction placed on members of an issuer's audit committee by the SEC. The SEC prohibits audit committee members from accepting any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fees from the registrant, as this could compromise their independence.

Next, I will evaluate the choices:
a) Establishing procedures for employees to anonymously report fraud is a responsibility of the audit committee and is not prohibited.
b) Being responsible for the compensation of a registered public accounting firm is also a duty of the audit committee and is not prohibited.
c) Accepting consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fees from the registrant is prohibited by the SEC to maintain independence.
d) Engaging independent counsel as deemed necessary is allowed and is part of the audit committee's responsibilities.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, a rational and risk-averse investor prefers higher returns and lower risks. This means that for two points, the one with a higher return and/or lower risk is more favorable.

Next, let's analyze the given points:
- (2,2): Risk = 2, Return = 2
- (2,3): Risk = 2, Return = 3 (higher return than (2,2) for the same risk, so more favorable)
- (4,2): Risk = 4, Return = 2 (higher risk than (2,2) for the same return, so less favorable)

Finally, ordering the points from least to most favorable:
1. (4,2) (highest risk for the same return as (2,2))
2. (2,2) (lower risk but lower return than (2,3))
3. (2,3) (highest return for the same risk as (2,2))

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Determine the cash-basis income**: Under the cash basis, income is recognized when cash is received. Sussman collected $1,900 in January from credit sales. This is the cash-basis income.

2. **Adjust for credit sales**: Under the accrual basis, income is recognized when earned, not when cash is received. Sussman had $5,600 in credit sales for January. This means an additional $5,600 - $1,900 = $3,700 of income needs to be added to restate to the accrual basis.

3. **Adjust for accrued salaries**: Under the accrual basis, expenses are recognized when incurred, not when paid. Sussman accrued $1,200 in salaries for January. This amount needs to be subtracted from the cash-basis income.

4. **Calculate the net increase**: The net increase in income when restating to the accrual basis is $3,700 (credit sales adjustment) - $1,200 (accrued salaries adjustment) = $2,500.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to identify the steps involved in an effective approach to monitoring internal control according to COSO. COSO emphasizes establishing a foundation for monitoring, designing and executing monitoring procedures based on risks, and assessing and reporting results, including corrective actions.

Next, I need to evaluate the choices. Option a) is a valid step as it involves establishing a foundation for monitoring. Option c) is also valid as it focuses on designing and executing risk-based monitoring procedures. Option d) is valid as it involves assessing and reporting results.

Finally, option b) does not directly describe a step in the monitoring process but rather an outcome or objective of internal control. Therefore, it is not a step in the COSO monitoring approach.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the bond interest expense for the year ended December 31, year 1, we need to consider the following:

1. The bond was issued on June 1, year 1. This means the bondholder starts accruing interest from this date.
2. The bond has interest payment dates of April 1 and October 1. The interest expense for the year will be based on the time the bond was outstanding during the year.
3. From June 1 to December 31, year 1, the bond is outstanding for seven months (June, July, August, September, October, November, and December).

Thus, the bond interest expense for the year ended December 31, year 1, is for a period of seven months.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a)** Tests of details typically provide a low level of assurance.  
   - This is incorrect because tests of details are designed to provide a high level of assurance about specific assertions in the financial statements.

2. **Option b)** Analytical procedures are an inefficient means of obtaining assurance.  
   - This is incorrect because analytical procedures are often efficient and effective, especially when used in the planning and review stages of an audit.

3. **Option c)** The procedures to be applied on a particular engagement are a matter of the auditor’s professional judgment.  
   - This is correct because the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures depend on the auditor's professional judgment, considering factors such as the risk of material misstatement and the effectiveness of internal controls.

4. **Option d)** The use of tests of controls should be considered without regard to the level of assurance required.  
   - This is incorrect because the decision to use tests of controls depends on the level of assurance required and the auditor's assessment of control risk.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. A partnership is considered terminated for tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interest in partnership capital and profits within a 12-month period.
2. In this case, Stone sold his entire 35% interest to Taylor on April 9. This sale does not constitute a termination because it is less than 50% of the total partnership interest.
3. Since no other events are mentioned that would lead to a termination, the partnership continues to exist for tax purposes.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the key principles of the just-in-time (JIT) approach. JIT focuses on reducing waste by producing only what is needed, when it is needed, and in the quantity needed. This often results in maintaining low inventory levels.

Next, I need to consider the traditional manufacturing approach, which typically involves maintaining higher inventory levels to ensure production is not disrupted by supply chain issues or demand fluctuations.

Finally, I compare the options provided. Option d) correctly highlights the major difference between JIT and traditional approaches, as JIT operates with low inventory levels while traditional approaches may operate with high inventory levels.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate the depreciation expense for each component of the equipment separately, as required under IFRS, and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate depreciation for the two major components (80% of $100 million):**
   - Total cost of these two components = 80% of $100 million = $80 million.
   - Useful life = 20 years.
   - Depreciation per year for these two components = $80 million ÷ 20 = $4 million.

2. **Calculate depreciation for the first smaller component ($10 million, 4-year useful life):**
   - Depreciation per year = $10 million ÷ 4 = $2.5 million.

3. **Calculate depreciation for the second smaller component ($10 million, 5-year useful life):**
   - Depreciation per year = $10 million ÷ 5 = $2 million.

4. **Sum up the depreciation expenses:**
   - Total depreciation = $4 million (major components) + $2.5 million (first smaller component) + $2 million (second smaller component) = $8.5 million.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, the committee should consider the long-term benefits of integrating the fixed asset process into the new enterprise-wide system, as integration can improve efficiency, accuracy, and data consistency across the organization. 

Next, while the current spreadsheet process may seem to work properly, it is not scalable, lacks robust controls, and may pose risks such as data loss or errors. A more robust solution would align with the organization's long-term goals.

Finally, adopting the fixed asset module of the new system would ensure seamless integration with other processes, reduce manual work, and provide better reporting and control capabilities.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a)** ""Auditor suspects that management fraud has occurred during the year.""  
   - Stratifying the population is not directly related to detecting fraud. Stratification is used to divide the population into subgroups to improve sampling efficiency, not specifically for fraud detection. This option is unlikely to be correct.

2. **Option b)** ""Desired assessed level of control risk is less than the prior year.""  
   - Control risk assessment is related to the auditor's evaluation of internal controls, not directly to the stratification of a population for substantive testing. This option is also unlikely to be correct.

3. **Option c)** ""Technique to be used is attribute sampling.""  
   - Attribute sampling is typically used for tests of controls, not substantive tests. Stratification is more relevant for substantive tests to focus on specific subgroups, such as large or high-risk items. This option is not correct.

4. **Option d)** ""Auditor plans to give greater representation to large recorded amounts.""  
   - Stratification is often used in substantive testing to give more attention to significant or high-value items in the population. This improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the audit by focusing on items that are more likely to contain material misstatements. This option is correct.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. A shareholder's right to inspect corporate books and records is not absolute. It is subject to certain conditions, such as the purpose of the inspection. Therefore, option (a) is incorrect.

2. There is no requirement that a shareholder must own a specific monetary value of stock (e.g., $5000) to exercise the right to inspect corporate records. Thus, option (b) is incorrect.

3. A shareholder's right to inspect corporate books and records generally requires that the demand to inspect is made for a proper purpose, such as investigating potential mismanagement or protecting shareholder interests. This makes option (c) a valid statement.

4. The right to inspect does not exist solely when fraud or illegality is alleged. Shareholders may have other proper purposes for inspection, such as evaluating the value of their shares or ensuring proper corporate governance. Therefore, option (d) is incorrect.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the nature of a CPA's review engagement for a nonissuer. A review engagement involves limited assurance and primarily consists of inquiries and analytical procedures, rather than extensive testing or evaluation.

Next, I need to evaluate each option:
a) Making inquiries of management concerning restrictions on the availability of cash balances aligns with the procedures of a review engagement, as it involves inquiry.
b) Communicating deficiencies in internal control is typically part of an audit, not a review engagement.
c) Examining trend analysis to assess detection risk is related to audit procedures, not review engagements.
d) Evaluating management's plans for dealing with financial difficulties is not a standard procedure in a review engagement.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the cash disbursements for June purchases, we need to calculate the purchases for June and then adjust for changes in accounts payable. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Calculate the cost of purchases for June**:  
   The formula for purchases is:  
   Purchases = Cost of Goods Sold + Ending Inventory - Beginning Inventory.  
   Substituting the given values:  
   Purchases = $300,000 + $180,000 - $150,000 = $330,000.

2. **Adjust for changes in accounts payable**:  
   Cash disbursements = Purchases - Increase in Accounts Payable (or + Decrease in Accounts Payable).  
   The accounts payable decreased from $85,000 to $75,000, so the decrease is $10,000.  
   Cash disbursements = $330,000 + $10,000 = $340,000.

3. **Final calculation and selection of the correct answer**:  
   The cash disbursements for June purchases are $340,000.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the amount of West's AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax) tax preference items, we need to analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Long-term capital gain**: Long-term capital gains are not considered AMT tax preference items. Therefore, the $15,000 long-term capital gain does not contribute to the AMT tax preference items.

2. **Percentage depletion in excess of property's adjusted basis**: The excess of percentage depletion over the adjusted basis of the property is considered an AMT tax preference item. In this case, the amount is $9,000.

3. **Dividends from publicly-held companies**: Dividends from publicly-held companies are not considered AMT tax preference items. Therefore, the $10,000 in dividends does not contribute to the AMT tax preference items.

4. **Total AMT tax preference items**: Adding up the amounts that qualify as AMT tax preference items, we only have the $9,000 from the percentage depletion.

Thus, the total amount of West's AMT tax preference items is **$9,000**.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this:

1. Under IFRS, errors identified in prior periods must be corrected retrospectively. This means the financial statements for prior periods should be adjusted as if the error had never occurred.
2. The $40,000 loss accrual relates to a year 1 event, so it should be recognized in the December 31, year 1, IFRS statement of financial position.
3. The $50,000 loss accrual relates to a year 2 event, so it will not be included in the year 1 statement of financial position but will be recognized in year 2.

Therefore, the correct amount of loss accrual to report in the December 31, year 1, IFRS statement of financial position is $40,000.

{'sol': 'b'}"
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. The present value of cash flows represents the value of future cash flows discounted to the present time. This is a key concept in evaluating the profitability of a project.
2. A project is considered acceptable if it generates more value than it costs. This means the present value of cash flows should be greater than the initial investment.
3. If the present value of cash flows is less than or equal to the initial investment, the project would not generate a positive return or profit.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total tax basis of the distribution received by Gulde**: Gulde received $12,000 in cash and land with an adjusted basis of $10,000. The total tax basis of the distribution is $12,000 (cash) + $10,000 (land) = $22,000.

2. **Compare the total tax basis of the distribution to Gulde’s tax basis in the partnership**: Gulde’s tax basis in the partnership was $26,000. Since the total tax basis of the distribution ($22,000) is less than Gulde’s tax basis in the partnership ($26,000), there is no gain or loss recognized. The remaining basis of $26,000 - $22,000 = $4,000 will be allocated to the land.

3. **Calculate Gulde’s basis in the land**: The adjusted basis of the land to Chyme was $10,000, but Gulde’s basis in the land will be adjusted to reflect the remaining partnership basis. Gulde’s basis in the land is $10,000 (adjusted basis of the land) + $4,000 (remaining partnership basis) = $14,000.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the net cash used in investing activities, we need to consider the classification of the purchases:

1. The Otra Co. bonds are classified as available-for-sale securities. Purchases of such securities are considered investing activities. Therefore, the $200,000 spent on these bonds will be included in the cash flows from investing activities.

2. The U.S. Treasury bills are classified as cash equivalents. Purchases of cash equivalents are not considered investing activities because they are part of cash and cash equivalents. Therefore, the $50,000 spent on Treasury bills will not be included in the cash flows from investing activities.

3. Adding up the amounts, only the $200,000 spent on the Otra Co. bonds is reported as net cash used in investing activities.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to consider the responsibilities of a successor auditor when communicating with the predecessor auditor. The successor auditor is required to obtain information that may affect the audit, including matters related to management integrity, disagreements, and reasons for the change of auditors.

Next, I need to evaluate each option. Option a) involves disagreements about accounting policies, which is relevant for understanding potential issues in the audit. Option b) involves understanding the reasons for the change, which is also critical for assessing risks. Option c) involves facts about management integrity, which is essential for evaluating the reliability of management representations. Option d) involves consistency in financial reporting, which is more related to audit procedures rather than initial communication.

Finally, the most comprehensive and relevant information the successor auditor would request includes disagreements, reasons for the change, and facts about management integrity. Among the choices, the most appropriate and specific request is option c), as it directly addresses management integrity, a key factor in audit risk assessment.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Line of Credit**: The company has drawn $250,000 from a $1,000,000 line of credit, which matures in one year. Since it matures within one year, the $250,000 is classified as a current liability.

2. **Secured Note**: The $750,000 secured note is due in five annual installments. This means $750,000 ÷ 5 = $150,000 is due within the next year, which is classified as a current liability. The remaining $750,000 - $150,000 = $600,000 is classified as a long-term liability.

3. **Balloon Note**: The $300,000 three-year balloon note matures in three years. Since it is not due within the next year, the entire $300,000 is classified as a long-term liability.

4. **Total Classification**:
   - Current liabilities: $250,000 (line of credit) + $150,000 (current portion of secured note) = $400,000.
   - Long-term liabilities: $600,000 (long-term portion of secured note) + $300,000 (balloon note) = $900,000.

Thus, the correct classification is **current liabilities of $400,000 and long-term liabilities of $900,000**.

"To solve this, I will calculate the production budget for the first quarter step by step:

1. **Determine the desired ending inventory for the first quarter**:  
   The ending inventory for the first quarter should equal 30% of the second quarter's budgeted sales.  
   Second quarter sales = 40,000 units.  
   Desired ending inventory = 30% of 40,000 = 12,000 units.

2. **Calculate the total units required for the first quarter**:  
   Total units required = First quarter sales + Desired ending inventory.  
   First quarter sales = 30,000 units.  
   Total units required = 30,000 + 12,000 = 42,000 units.

3. **Subtract the beginning inventory**:  
   Beginning inventory for the first quarter = 9,000 units.  
   Units to be produced = Total units required - Beginning inventory.  
   Units to be produced = 42,000 - 9,000 = 33,000 units.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Johnson's salary is $100,000, which is already part of his gross income.
2. The group term life insurance provided as a fringe benefit is twice Johnson's salary, so the coverage amount is 2 * $100,000 = $200,000.
3. The IRS allows the first $50,000 of group term life insurance coverage to be excluded from gross income. Therefore, the taxable portion of the coverage is $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.
4. The annual IRS established uniform cost of insurance is $2.76 per $1,000 of coverage. For $150,000 of taxable coverage, the cost is ($150,000 ÷ $1,000) * $2.76 = 150 * $2.76 = $414.
5. Adding this taxable fringe benefit to Johnson's salary, the total gross income is $100,000 + $414 = $100,414.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Vale's share of the partnership's taxable income**:  
   - The partnership reported $80,000 of tax-exempt interest income and $12,000 of dividend income.  
   - Tax-exempt interest income is not included in adjusted gross income (AGI), so it is excluded from the calculation.  
   - Dividend income is taxable and included in AGI. Vale is a 50% partner, so Vale's share of the dividend income is 50% of $12,000 = $6,000.

2. **Consider the cash distribution**:  
   - The $10,000 nonliquidating cash distribution to Vale does not affect Vale's AGI because it is a return of capital and not taxable income.

3. **Calculate the total gross income from Ball to be included in Vale's AGI**:  
   - The only taxable income from Ball is Vale's share of the dividend income, which is $6,000.

Thus, the total amount of gross income from Ball to be included in Vale's year 1 AGI is **$6,000**.

The correct answer is: {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze the situation. The substantial increase in sales in December, year 1, followed by a corresponding decrease in January, year 2, could indicate that sales were recorded prematurely to inflate revenue for year 1. This is a common red flag for financial reporting fraud.

Next, I need to consider the nature of the potential fraud. The issue does not directly suggest theft, embezzlement, or misappropriation of assets, as it pertains to the timing of revenue recognition rather than the misappropriation of physical or monetary assets.

Finally, the most appropriate conclusion is that this situation broadly indicates the potential for financial reporting fraud, as it involves the manipulation of sales revenue to misstate financial performance.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to calculate the intrinsic value of the warrant. The intrinsic value is the difference between the market price of the stock and the exercise price of the warrant. 

Next, the market price of the stock is $30, and the exercise price is $20. The intrinsic value is $30 - $20 = $10.

Finally, since the intrinsic value is $10 and there are no other factors mentioned that would affect the theoretical value, the theoretical value of the warrant is $10.

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the question step by step:

1. The question highlights that the internal auditor has identified missing minimum control requirements in the end-user computing (EUC) files. This implies that there is a risk associated with the use of these files, particularly if they are incorrect or unreliable.

2. The key risk of using potentially incorrect EUC files is that management might unknowingly rely on these files for decision-making, assuming they are as accurate and reliable as files generated from more controlled systems like mainframe systems.

3. Among the options provided, the most relevant risk is that management places the same degree of reliance on EUC files as they do on files generated from mainframe systems, which could lead to incorrect decisions based on flawed data.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: Insuring the lives of key executives and listing the entity as beneficiary is a common business practice and does not necessarily indicate a related party transaction. This is a standard risk management strategy.

2. **Option b**: Selling real estate at a price that differs significantly from its appraised value could indicate a related party transaction. Such a transaction might occur if the buyer or seller has a close relationship with the entity, leading to terms that are not at arm's length.

3. **Option c**: Making a loan with specific scheduled terms for repayment of the funds is a standard financial transaction and does not inherently suggest a related party transaction unless the loan terms are unusual or the borrower is a related party.

4. **Option d**: Granting stock options to key executives at favorable prices is a common compensation practice and does not necessarily indicate a related party transaction. It is part of executive compensation plans.

The most likely indicator of a related party transaction is **option b**, as selling real estate at a price significantly different from its appraised value could suggest a transaction influenced by a relationship between the parties.

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a: Prior years’ depreciation expenses were erroneously understated.**  
   If prior years' depreciation expenses were understated, the correction would typically involve adjusting retained earnings or prior period adjustments, not debiting accumulated depreciation in the current year. This is unlikely to explain significant debits to accumulated depreciation.

2. **Option b: Current year’s depreciation expense was erroneously understated.**  
   If the current year's depreciation expense was understated, the correction would involve increasing the depreciation expense account, not debiting accumulated depreciation. This option does not explain the debits to accumulated depreciation.

3. **Option c: The estimated remaining useful lives of plant assets were revised upward.**  
   Revising the estimated useful lives of assets upward would reduce the depreciation expense going forward, but it would not involve debiting accumulated depreciation. This option does not explain the debits to accumulated depreciation.

4. **Option d: Plant assets were retired during the current year.**  
   When plant assets are retired, the accumulated depreciation account is debited to remove the depreciation associated with the retired assets. This is the most likely explanation for significant debits to accumulated depreciation.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. The indirect method for preparing the statement of cash flows starts with the change in net assets (or net income for for-profit entities) and adjusts for non-cash expenses, changes in working capital, and other non-operating items.
2. Depreciation is a non-cash expense that reduces net assets but does not involve an actual cash outflow. Therefore, it must be added back to the change in net assets to determine net cash provided (used) by operating activities.
3. The other options (purchase of equipment, payment on long-term debt, and decrease in accounts payable) are either investing or financing activities or adjustments to working capital, not non-cash expenses to be added back.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the impact of the new system on each of the listed exposures. The system includes an identification number, a clock-in/clock-out button, and a video camera capturing the employee's image.

1. Fraudulent reporting of employees’ own hours: The system can reduce this exposure because the video camera and identification number make it harder for employees to falsify their own hours.

2. Errors in employees’ overtime computation: This exposure is related to the accuracy of calculations, which is not directly addressed by the new system. The system focuses on recording attendance, not on the computation process.

3. Inaccurate accounting of employees’ hours: The system can reduce this exposure because it ensures that employees' clock-in and clock-out times are recorded accurately with verification through the video camera.

4. Recording of other employees’ hours: The system can reduce this exposure because the identification number and video camera make it difficult for one employee to clock in or out for another.

Based on this analysis, the exposure least likely to be changed by the new system is errors in employees’ overtime computation.

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Understand the context**: A CPA prepared a tax return involving a tax shelter transaction. Tax shelter transactions are subject to stricter standards, and penalties may apply if the CPA does not meet specific requirements.

2. **Review the penalty standards**: For disclosed tax shelter transactions, the CPA must meet a higher standard than just having a ""reasonable basis"" for the position. The position must either have ""substantial authority"" or it must be ""reasonable to believe that the position would more likely than not be upheld.""

3. **Evaluate the choices**:
   - **a) There was substantial authority for the position**: This is a valid standard for avoiding penalties in tax shelter cases.
   - **b) It is reasonable to believe that the position would more likely than not be upheld**: This is also a valid standard for avoiding penalties in tax shelter cases.
   - **c) There was a reasonable possibility of success for the position**: This is not a recognized standard for avoiding penalties in tax shelter cases.
   - **d) There was a reasonable basis for the position**: This is a lower standard and is insufficient for avoiding penalties in tax shelter cases.

"To solve this, I will calculate the weighted average number of shares outstanding, subtract the preferred dividends from net income, and then divide the adjusted net income by the weighted average shares to find the earnings per share (EPS).

1. **Calculate the weighted average number of shares outstanding**:
   - From January 1 to March 31 (3 months), 120,000 shares were outstanding.
   - From April 1 to December 31 (9 months), 120,000 + 40,000 = 160,000 shares were outstanding.
   - Weighted average shares = (120,000 × 3/12) + (160,000 × 9/12) = 30,000 + 120,000 = 150,000 shares.

2. **Adjust net income for preferred dividends**:
   - Preferred dividends = 10,000 shares × $5 = $50,000.
   - Adjusted net income = $480,000 - $50,000 = $430,000.

3. **Calculate earnings per share (EPS)**:
   - EPS = Adjusted net income ÷ Weighted average shares = $430,000 ÷ 150,000 = $2.87.

"To solve this, I will use the double-declining balance method of depreciation. 

1. First, calculate the double-declining rate. The straight-line depreciation rate is 1/3 (since the asset has a 3-year life), so the double-declining rate is 2/3 or approximately 66.67%.

2. Next, calculate the depreciation for the first year. The asset was purchased on May 1, so it is used for 8 months in the first year (May to December). The depreciation for the first year is calculated as:
   Depreciation = (Cost of the asset × Double-declining rate) × (8/12)
   Depreciation = ($12,000 × 66.67%) × (8/12) = $8,000 × (8/12) = $5,333.

3. The depreciation expense for the year ended December 31 is $5,333.

"First, I need to consider the nature of the engagement. A review engagement provides limited assurance and does not involve expressing an opinion like in an audit. Therefore, issuing an adverse opinion (choice a) is not appropriate for a review engagement.

Next, I need to evaluate whether the accountant can express any assurance. Since the accountant is aware of a material departure from GAAP, they cannot provide unmodified assurance but can still disclose the issue in the report. Thus, expressing no assurance at all (choice b) is not correct.

Then, I consider whether emphasizing limited use (choice c) is relevant. This is not the primary issue here, as the problem is the material departure from GAAP, not the intended use of the financial statements.

Finally, I consider disclosing the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph (choice d). This is the correct approach in a review engagement when there is a material departure from GAAP, as it allows the accountant to modify the report appropriately while still providing limited assurance.

"To solve this, I will calculate the weighted average cost of goods sold step by step:

1. **Determine the total cost and total units available for sale:**
   - Beginning inventory: 200 units at a total cost of $1250.
   - Purchases on May 4: 20 units at $5.80 each, total cost = $116.
   - Purchases on May 17: 80 units at $5.50 each, total cost = $440.
   - Total units available = 200 + 20 + 80 = 300 units.
   - Total cost = $1250 + $116 + $440 = $1806.

2. **Calculate the weighted average cost per unit:**
   - Weighted average cost per unit = Total cost ÷ Total units available.
   - Weighted average cost per unit = $1806 ÷ 300 = $6.02 per unit.

3. **Calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS) for the 10 units sold:**
   - COGS = Weighted average cost per unit × Number of units sold.
   - COGS = $6.02 × 10 = $60.20.

The weighted average cost of goods sold for May is **$60.20**.

"To determine the liability Dash Co. should report as of June 30, we need to calculate the portion of the utility bills that has been incurred but not yet paid by that date.

1. The utility bill for the period May 16 – June 15 is $6,000, and it was paid on July 1. Since this bill covers a period ending before June 30, the entire $6,000 is a liability as of June 30.

2. The utility bill for the period June 16 – July 15 is $8,000, and it was paid on August 1. As of June 30, only the portion of this bill that pertains to June (June 16 – June 30) is a liability. This period is 15 days, which is half of the billing period (30 days). Therefore, the liability for this period is $8,000 × 15/30 = $4,000.

3. Adding these amounts together, the total liability as of June 30 is $6,000 + $4,000 = $10,000.

"To determine the correct filing status for the surviving spouse in year 2, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Understand the situation**: The spouse passed away on December 31, year 1. The couple had no dependents. This means the surviving spouse is not eligible to file as ""Qualifying widow(er)"" because that status requires having a dependent child.

2. **Evaluate the filing status options**:
   - ""Married filing jointly"" is not an option for year 2 because the spouse is no longer alive.
   - ""Head of household"" is not applicable because the surviving spouse has no dependents.
   - The only remaining option is ""Single,"" which is the correct filing status for a surviving spouse without dependents in the year following the spouse's death.

"To determine the cost per equivalent whole unit, we need to calculate the total costs and the equivalent units of production. Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total costs:**
   - Direct materials cost = $114,000
   - Direct labor cost = $38,000
   - Manufacturing overhead = 50% of direct materials = 0.5 × $114,000 = $57,000
   - Total costs = $114,000 + $38,000 + $57,000 = $209,000

2. **Determine the equivalent units of production:**
   - Completed units = 9,000
   - Ending work-in-process (WIP) inventory = 10,000 started - 9,000 completed = 1,000 units
   - Materials are 100% complete for WIP, so equivalent units for materials = 1,000
   - Conversion is 50% complete for WIP, so equivalent units for conversion = 1,000 × 50% = 500
   - Total equivalent units = Completed units + Equivalent units for WIP
     - For materials: 9,000 + 1,000 = 10,000
     - For conversion: 9,000 + 500 = 9,500

3. **Calculate the cost per equivalent whole unit:**
   - Cost per equivalent unit for materials = Total materials cost ÷ Equivalent units for materials = $114,000 ÷ 10,000 = $11.40
   - Cost per equivalent unit for conversion = (Direct labor + Manufacturing overhead) ÷ Equivalent units for conversion = ($38,000 + $57,000) ÷ 9,500 = $95,000 ÷ 9,500 = $10.00
   - Total cost per equivalent unit = $11.40 + $10.00 = $21.40

3. **Option c**: Tracing the authorization for the options granted to the board of directors' approval is a substantive test that ensures the granting of stock options was properly authorized, which is a key aspect of the audit.

4. **Option d**: Reviewing public records of the SEC to determine whether the options were properly reported is more related to compliance and disclosure, not directly related to substantive testing of the granting process.

The most appropriate substantive test in this context is to trace the authorization of the options to the board of directors' approval.

"To determine the least likely procedure an accountant would perform during a review engagement for a nonissuer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: Making inquiries of management about actions taken at board of directors' meetings is a common procedure in a review engagement. It helps the accountant understand significant events or decisions that could impact the financial statements. This is a likely procedure.

2. **Option b**: Studying the relationships of financial statement elements expected to conform to predictable patterns is part of analytical procedures, which are a key component of a review engagement. This is also a likely procedure.

A review engagement does not involve obtaining an understanding of internal controls or testing their effectiveness. This is the least likely procedure.

4. **Option d**: Comparing the financial statements with anticipated results in budgets and forecasts is part of analytical procedures, which are commonly performed in a review engagement. This is a likely procedure.

Therefore, the least likely procedure is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand what a compilation of financial statements entails under the Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS). A compilation involves presenting financial information in the form of financial statements without providing any assurance on them.

Next, I need to identify the key characteristic of a compilation. It is limited to presenting information that is the representation of management, without performing any audit or review procedures.

Finally, I compare the choices. The correct answer aligns with the definition of a compilation, which is presenting information in the form of financial statements that is the representation of management.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I will use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) formula:  
Required return = Risk-free rate + Beta × (Market return − Risk-free rate).

Step 1: Calculate the required return for Stock A.  
The beta for Stock A is 0.8, the risk-free rate is 7%, and the market return is 10%.  
Required return for Stock A = 7% + 0.8 × (10% − 7%) = 7% + 0.8 × 3% = 7% + 2.4% = 9.4%.

Step 2: Calculate the required return for Stock B.  
The beta for Stock B is 1.4, the risk-free rate is 7%, and the market return is 10%.  
Required return for Stock B = 7% + 1.4 × (10% − 7%) = 7% + 1.4 × 3% = 7% + 4.2% = 11.2%.

Step 3: Match the calculated returns to the given choices.  
The required returns for Stocks A and B are 9.4% and 11.2%, respectively.  

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the ratios**:  
   - The current ratio is 3-to-1, meaning current assets are 3 times the current liabilities.  
   - The quick ratio is 1-to-1, meaning quick assets (current assets minus inventory and prepaid expenses) are equal to current liabilities.

2. **Calculate current assets**:  
   Using the current ratio formula:  
   \[
   \text{Current Assets} = \text{Current Liabilities} \times 3
   \]  
   Substituting the given current liabilities of $322,000:  
   \[
   \text{Current Assets} = 322,000 \times 3 = 966,000
   \]

3. **Calculate quick assets**:  
   Using the quick ratio formula:  
   \[
   \text{Quick Assets} = \text{Current Liabilities} \times 1
   \]  
   Substituting the given current liabilities of $322,000:  
   \[
   \text{Quick Assets} = 322,000
   \]

4. **Find inventory and prepaid expenses**:  
   Inventory and prepaid expenses are the difference between current assets and quick assets:  
   \[
   \text{Inventory and Prepaid Expenses} = \text{Current Assets} - \text{Quick Assets}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \text{Inventory and Prepaid Expenses} = 966,000 - 322,000 = 644,000
   \]

Thus, the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses is $644,000. The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's analyze the characteristics of information in the statistical tables and financial statements step by step:

1. **Statistical tables** in a comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR) often include data covering financial trends over multiple years. This is a key feature of statistical tables, as they provide a broader historical perspective.

2. **Financial statements**, on the other hand, typically focus on a single fiscal year and provide detailed information about the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for that specific year.

3. Based on this distinction, statistical tables include data covering financial trends (Yes), while financial statements focus on a single fiscal year (No).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the document that the FASB typically issues as part of its due-process activities for amending the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  
Second, the FASB issues a ""proposed accounting standards update"" (ASU) to solicit feedback from stakeholders before finalizing changes to the Codification.  
Third, the other options (statement of position, accounting research bulletin, and staff accounting bulletin) are not part of the FASB's due-process activities for amending the Codification.  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The functional currency is defined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates. This is the currency in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash.

2. Option a) ""In which the subsidiary maintains its accounting records"" is incorrect because the functional currency is not determined by the accounting records but by the economic environment.

3. Option b) ""Of the country in which the subsidiary is located"" is also incorrect because the functional currency is not necessarily tied to the subsidiary's physical location.

4. Option c) ""Of the country in which the parent is located"" is incorrect because the functional currency is determined by the subsidiary's operations, not the parent's location.

5. Option d) ""Of the environment in which the subsidiary primarily generates and expends cash"" is correct because it aligns with the definition of the functional currency.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the purpose of each COSO component. The control environment sets the tone of the organization, risk assessment identifies and analyzes risks, information and communication ensure relevant information is shared, and monitoring ensures that internal controls are functioning as intended.

Next, I need to identify which component specifically focuses on ensuring the ongoing effectiveness of internal controls. Monitoring involves regular evaluations and assessments to ensure that controls are operating effectively over time.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the intrinsic value of the call option at the time of initial investment, I will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the intrinsic value of a call option**: The intrinsic value of a call option is the difference between the market price of the stock and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of shares, but only if the market price is higher than the exercise price. If the market price is less than or equal to the exercise price, the intrinsic value is zero.

2. **Calculate the intrinsic value**: The market price of Gin Co. stock is $10 per share, and the exercise price of the call option is $9 per share. The difference is $10 - $9 = $1 per share. Since the call option is for 100 shares, the intrinsic value is $1 × 100 = $100.

3. **Verify the result**: The intrinsic value is $100, which matches the calculation above. The initial investment of $200 is irrelevant to the intrinsic value calculation.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: Failure to sign a prepared tax return as a tax preparer.  
   The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) imposes penalties on tax return preparers for failing to sign a prepared tax return. This is a requirement under the regulations, and penalties can be assessed for noncompliance.

2. **Option b**: Failure to provide a copy of a prepared tax return to the taxpayer.  
   Tax return preparers are required to provide a copy of the prepared tax return to the taxpayer. Failure to do so can result in penalties under the IRC.

3. **Option c**: Failure to notify a taxpayer about an inadvertent error on a tax return filed 10 years ago.  
   The IRC and regulations do not impose penalties on tax return preparers for failing to notify a taxpayer about an error on a tax return filed many years ago. There is no specific requirement for preparers to monitor or notify taxpayers about past errors beyond the scope of their engagement.

4. **Option d**: Failure to retain copies of prepared tax returns or a list of taxpayers for whom such returns were prepared for the last three years.  
   Tax return preparers are required to retain copies of prepared tax returns or maintain a list of taxpayers for whom such returns were prepared for at least three years. Failure to comply with this requirement can result in penalties.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the purpose of an emphasis-of-matter paragraph. It is used to draw attention to a matter that is fundamental to users' understanding of the financial statements but does not affect the auditor's opinion.

Next, I need to determine the correct placement of the emphasis-of-matter paragraph in the audit report. According to auditing standards, the emphasis-of-matter paragraph should be included immediately after the opinion paragraph.

Finally, I need to confirm that this placement aligns with the choices provided. The correct choice is the one that specifies the emphasis-of-matter paragraph is included immediately after the opinion paragraph.

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Understanding fraudulent issuance of an unqualified opinion**: If a CPA fraudulently issues an unqualified opinion on materially misstated financial statements, the CPA knowingly misrepresents the financial condition of the corporation. Fraudulent actions make the CPA liable to any party that relies on the financial statements and suffers a loss as a result.

2. **Liability to corporate shareholders**: Shareholders rely on the financial statements to make investment decisions. If the CPA's fraudulent opinion causes them to suffer financial losses, the CPA can be held liable to the shareholders.

3. **Liability to corporate bondholders**: Similarly, bondholders also rely on the financial statements to assess the corporation's creditworthiness. If the CPA's fraudulent opinion leads to financial losses for the bondholders, the CPA can also be held liable to them.

Thus, the CPA is liable to both corporate shareholders and corporate bondholders in the case of fraud.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: ""$3,000 of suspended losses can be utilized each year against portfolio income.""  
   This is incorrect because suspended passive activity losses cannot be used against portfolio income. They can only be used to offset passive income or when the activity is disposed of in a taxable transaction.

2. **Option b**: ""Suspended losses can be carried forward, but not back, until utilized.""  
   This is correct. Suspended passive activity losses are carried forward indefinitely until they can be utilized against passive income or upon the disposition of the activity. They are not carried back.

3. **Option c**: ""Suspended losses must be carried back three years and forward seven years.""  
   This is incorrect. Suspended passive activity losses are not subject to a carryback or a specific forward period like net operating losses (NOLs). They are carried forward indefinitely.

4. **Option d**: ""A maximum of 50% of the suspended losses can be used each year when an election is made to forgo the carryback period.""  
   This is incorrect. There is no provision allowing for 50% of suspended passive activity losses to be used each year, nor is there a carryback period for these losses.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the amount to be expensed as research and development (R&D) costs, I will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the nature of the costs**: 
   - Labor and material costs incurred in producing a prototype ($100,000) are considered R&D costs because they are part of the development process before production begins.
   - The cost of testing the prototype ($40,000) is also considered R&D because it is part of the development phase.
   - Legal costs to file a patent ($5,000) are not considered R&D costs; they are capitalized as an intangible asset.

2. **Identify the costs to be expensed as R&D**:
   - Add the prototype production costs ($100,000) and the prototype testing costs ($40,000).
   - Exclude the patent filing costs ($5,000).

3. **Calculate the total R&D costs**:
   - $100,000 + $40,000 = $140,000.

Thus, the amount to be expensed as R&D costs is $140,000.

"First, I need to consider the situation where unexpected errors in accounts receivable have been found, leading to a change in risk assessment. This indicates an increase in the assessed risk of material misstatement.

Next, I need to evaluate the appropriateness of each response:
a) Moving detailed analytical procedures to interim would not address the increased risk effectively, as it does not provide direct evidence of the accuracy of accounts receivable.
b) Increasing the dollar threshold of vouching customer invoices would reduce the scope of testing, which is not appropriate when risk has increased.
c) Sending negative confirmations instead of positive confirmations is less effective in obtaining evidence, as negative confirmations rely on non-responses, which may not address the increased risk.
d) Using more experienced audit team members for year-end testing is a valid response, as it ensures that the increased risk is addressed with greater expertise and scrutiny.

Finally, the most appropriate response to the increased risk is to use more experienced audit team members for year-end testing.

"First, I need to understand the context of the question. The auditor is concerned about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern due to financial difficulties such as negative cash flows and working capital deficiencies. 

Next, I need to evaluate the choices. The auditor's primary responsibility in this situation is to assess how these financial difficulties might impact the financial statements and whether additional disclosures or modifications to the audit report are necessary.

Finally, the most relevant concern for the auditor would be the possible effects of these financial difficulties on the entity's financial statements, as this directly relates to the auditor's opinion and the users of the financial statements.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The statement of activities in the government-wide financial statements is designed to provide information about the overall financial activities of the government, including governmental activities, business-type activities, and discretely presented component units. This suggests that separate columns for these categories are included.

2. The statement of activities does not focus on individual funds (major or nonmajor governmental funds), as it is a government-wide statement and not a fund-based statement. Therefore, options b and c are incorrect.

3. The statement of activities does include a section that distinguishes between program revenues (directly associated with specific functions or programs) and general revenues (not directly associated with specific functions). This is a key feature of the statement.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a**: A statement that the practitioner performed an examination of prospective financial statements.  
   - This is incorrect because agreed-upon procedures engagements are not examinations. They involve performing specific procedures agreed upon by the parties, not an overall examination.

2. **Option b**: A statement of scope limitation that will qualify the practitioner’s opinion.  
   - This is incorrect because in an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the practitioner does not provide an opinion or assurance, so there is no need for a scope limitation or qualification.

3. **Option c**: A statement referring to standards established by the AICPA.  
   - This is correct because the practitioner’s report on agreed-upon procedures should include a statement that the engagement was conducted in accordance with standards established by the AICPA.

4. **Option d**: A statement of negative assurance based on procedures performed.  
   - This is incorrect because agreed-upon procedures engagements do not provide assurance (positive or negative). The practitioner simply reports the findings from the procedures performed.

- b) A heuristic program for accessing remote locations is unrelated to tracking or documenting transaction activities.
- c) Hardware security modules store sensitive data but do not provide a record of transaction activities.
- d) Computer activity logs that indicate failed transactions are essential for tracking and documenting issues in the transaction process, which is a key component of an audit trail.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to calculate the company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). The formula for EBIT is:  
EBIT = Income after tax + Interest expense + Tax expense.  

Next, I calculate the tax expense. Since the tax rate is 40%, the tax expense is:  
Tax expense = Income after tax ÷ (1 - Tax rate) × Tax rate = $5.4 million ÷ 0.6 × 0.4 = $3.6 million.  

Now, I calculate EBIT:  
EBIT = $5.4 million + $1 million (interest expense) + $3.6 million (tax expense) = $10 million.  

Finally, the times-interest-earned ratio is calculated as:  
Times-interest-earned ratio = EBIT ÷ Interest expense = $10 million ÷ $1 million = 10.  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of responsibility accounting. Responsibility accounting focuses on holding managers accountable for the costs and revenues they can control within their specific areas of responsibility.

Next, I will evaluate the choices:
a) This aligns with the essence of responsibility accounting, as it emphasizes creating performance reports based on controllable costs and revenues.
b) While allocating service department costs is important, it is not the primary focus of responsibility accounting.
c) Responsibility accounting is not about assigning blame but about accountability and control.
d) Investigating all variances is not the essence of responsibility accounting, as it focuses on controllable factors.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, during a period of inflation, the LIFO method assumes that the most recent (and higher-cost) inventory items are sold first, leaving the older (and lower-cost) inventory items in ending inventory. This results in a lower ending inventory value compared to FIFO.

Second, because LIFO results in higher cost of goods sold (COGS) during inflation, the taxable income will be lower, leading to lower income tax payable compared to FIFO.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Goodwill is an intangible asset that arises when a company acquires another business for a price higher than the fair value of its net identifiable assets. It is not recognized when costs are incurred in developing goodwill internally, as internally generated goodwill is not recorded under accounting standards. Therefore, option a) is incorrect.

2. Goodwill is recognized only when it is acquired through the purchase of a business. This is because it represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business. Therefore, option b) is correct.

3. The expectation of future benefits from goodwill does not lead to its recognition unless it is acquired through a business combination. Therefore, option c) is incorrect.

4. The fair market value of a company’s assets exceeding the book value does not directly result in the recognition of goodwill. Goodwill is specifically tied to the acquisition of another business. Therefore, option d) is incorrect.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. According to U.S. federal tax law, an individual generally has a time limit to file a claim for a refund of federal income taxes. This time limit is typically the later of:
   - Three years from the date the tax return was filed, or
   - Two years from the date the tax was paid.

2. In this case, the individual did not file a tax return for that year, so the three-year rule does not apply. Instead, the two-year rule applies, which means the individual must file the claim for refund within two years from the date the taxes were paid.

3. Since the taxes were paid 27 months ago, which is more than two years, the individual is outside the allowable time frame to file a claim for a refund.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Acceptance of a client relationship**: This is a key element of a CPA firm's quality control policies. It involves evaluating whether the firm should accept or continue a relationship with a client, considering factors such as the client's integrity and the firm's ability to perform the engagement competently.

2. **Professional skepticism of management**: While professional skepticism is an important concept in auditing, it is not specifically an element of a CPA firm's quality control policies. It is more of an auditor's mindset during the audit process.

3. **Computer information processing**: This refers to the use of technology in auditing but is not directly related to the firm's quality control policies.

4. **Efficiency of organizational structures**: While organizational efficiency is important, it is not a specific element of a CPA firm's quality control policies.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Understand the statute of limitations for tax adjustments**: Generally, the IRS has a three-year statute of limitations to assess additional tax from the date the return was filed. However, this period can be extended to six years if the taxpayer omits more than 25% of gross income. In this case, the agent does not find the error to be fraudulent or substantial, so the standard three-year statute of limitations applies.

2. **Determine the years under examination**: The adjustment proposed by the agent affects years 1 through 5. Since the returns were filed on the original due date, the statute of limitations for years 1 and 2 has likely expired by year 6, as more than three years have passed. Therefore, adjustments to those years would generally be improper unless an exception applies.

3. **Evaluate the choices**:
   - **a)** Incorrect. An agent can propose adjustments to prior years if they are within the statute of limitations or if an exception applies.
   - **b)** Incorrect. There is a statute of limitations for improperly claiming personal expenses as business expenses, and it does not fall under the ""no statute of limitations"" category unless fraud is involved.
   - **c)** Incorrect. This adjustment does not relate to a change in accounting method, so this exception does not apply.
   - **d)** Correct. The statute of limitations has expired for several years of the adjustment (years 1 and 2), making the adjustment improper for those years.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate the depreciation for each year using the double-declining balance method and determine the carrying amount at the end of the second year.

1. **Determine the depreciation rate**: The straight-line depreciation rate is 1/8 = 12.5%. The double-declining balance rate is 2 × 12.5% = 25%.

2. **Calculate depreciation for the first year**: The initial cost of the machine is $140,000. Depreciation for the first year is 25% of $140,000 = $35,000. The carrying amount at the end of the first year is $140,000 - $35,000 = $105,000.

3. **Calculate depreciation for the second year**: Depreciation for the second year is 25% of the carrying amount at the beginning of the year ($105,000). Depreciation = 25% × $105,000 = $26,250. The carrying amount at the end of the second year is $105,000 - $26,250 = $78,750.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The problem states that the city does not use the modified approach to account for roads. This means the city uses the depreciation approach, where the cost of the roads is allocated over their useful life as an expense each year.

2. The total cost of the roads is $800,000, and the useful life is 20 years. To calculate the annual depreciation expense, divide the total cost by the useful life:  
   $800,000 ÷ 20 = $40,000.

3. Since the question asks for the expense related to the new roads for the current year, the amount to report is the annual depreciation expense, which is $40,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the amortization expense, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the useful life for amortization**: Although the legal life of the copyright is the life of the author plus 50 years, Corbet expects to sell the book for only 5 years. Therefore, the useful life for amortization purposes is 5 years.

2. **Calculate the annual amortization expense**: The cost of the copyright is $20,000, and it will be amortized over 5 years. The annual amortization expense is $20,000 ÷ 5 = $4,000.

3. **Determine the amortization expense for the current year**: Since the copyright was purchased near the beginning of the year, the full annual amortization expense of $4,000 will be reported for the current year.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the gain the shareholder must recognize, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Determine the amount realized by the shareholder**: The amount realized includes the liability relief. Since the equipment is subject to a $12,000 liability, the shareholder is relieved of this liability, which is treated as part of the amount realized.

2. **Compare the amount realized to the basis of the equipment**: The basis of the equipment is $6,000. The amount realized is $12,000 (the liability relief). The difference between the amount realized and the basis is $12,000 - $6,000 = $6,000.

3. **Determine if the gain is recognized**: In this case, the shareholder must recognize the gain because the liability relief exceeds the basis of the equipment.

Thus, the gain the shareholder must recognize is $6,000.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine Carter's working capital, I need to calculate the difference between current assets and current liabilities.

1. First, I identify the current assets. These include:
   - Cash and cash equivalents: $200,000
   - Short-term investments: $100,000
   - Accounts receivable: $400,000
   - Inventories: $600,000  
   Total current assets = $200,000 + $100,000 + $400,000 + $600,000 = $1,300,000.

2. Next, I note the current liabilities, which are given as $640,000.

3. Finally, I calculate the working capital by subtracting current liabilities from current assets:
   Working capital = $1,300,000 - $640,000 = $660,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the context of the question. A CPA (Certified Public Accountant) conducting an audit has a duty of care to follow professional standards. If the CPA recklessly departs from these standards, it indicates a lack of reasonable care.

Next, I need to evaluate the legal terms provided in the choices. Strict liability typically applies to cases involving inherently dangerous activities, not professional services. Breach of contract applies when there is a failure to fulfill the terms of a contract, which is not the case here since the question involves third parties unknown to the CPA. Gross negligence involves a severe lack of care, but recklessness is generally categorized under negligence rather than gross negligence.

Finally, negligence is the failure to exercise reasonable care, which aligns with the CPA's reckless departure from due care. Under the law of negligence, the CPA can be held liable to third parties who are unknown to them.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To calculate the net present value (NPV), I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the present value (PV) of each cash inflow**: Use the formula \( PV = \frac{C}{(1 + r)^t} \), where \( C \) is the cash inflow, \( r \) is the discount rate (10% or 0.10), and \( t \) is the year. Sum the PVs for all five years.
   - Year 1: \( PV = \frac{3000}{(1 + 0.10)^1} = \frac{3000}{1.10} = 2727.27 \)
   - Year 2: \( PV = \frac{3000}{(1 + 0.10)^2} = \frac{3000}{1.21} = 2479.34 \)
   - Year 3: \( PV = \frac{3000}{(1 + 0.10)^3} = \frac{3000}{1.331} = 2253.94 \)
   - Year 4: \( PV = \frac{3000}{(1 + 0.10)^4} = \frac{3000}{1.4641} = 2049.41 \)
   - Year 5: \( PV = \frac{3000}{(1 + 0.10)^5} = \frac{3000}{1.61051} = 1853.92 \)

2. **Sum the present values**: Add the PVs from all five years.
   - Total PV = \( 2727.27 + 2479.34 + 2253.94 + 2049.41 + 1853.92 = 11363.88 \)

3. **Calculate the NPV**: Subtract the initial investment ($11,000) from the total PV.
   - NPV = \( 11363.88 - 11000 = 363.88 \), which rounds to approximately $370.

"First, I need to evaluate each option to determine which one would most likely heighten an auditor's concern about the risk of fraudulent financial reporting.

1. Option a) The audit committee's approval of the initial selection of accounting principles is a standard governance practice and does not inherently indicate a heightened risk of fraud.
2. Option b) A lack of competition in the entity's industry accompanied by increasing profit margins may indicate favorable market conditions but does not directly suggest fraudulent financial reporting.
3. Option c) Management's disclosure of unresolved litigation and contingent liabilities demonstrates transparency and does not necessarily heighten the risk of fraud.
4. Option d) Year-end adjustments by the entity that significantly affect financial results could indicate potential manipulation of financial statements to meet targets or expectations, which is a red flag for fraudulent financial reporting.

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Inspection of in-process goods**: This technique focuses on identifying defects during the production process. While it helps in detecting quality issues, it does not directly measure improvements in product quality as a result of internal failure costs.

2. **Recording the number of products returned over time**: This measures external failure costs (e.g., customer returns) rather than internal failure costs. It does not directly address improvements in product quality due to internal failures.

3. **Tracking the number of products reworked**: Rework is a direct result of internal failure costs. By tracking the number of products reworked, one can measure improvements in product quality, as a reduction in rework indicates fewer internal failures.

4. **Tracking warranty expenses over time**: Warranty expenses are associated with external failure costs, not internal failure costs. This option does not directly measure improvements in product quality due to internal failures.

"First, I need to consider the CPA's responsibility when preparing a tax return. A CPA is expected to exercise due diligence in ensuring that the information provided by the client is accurate and supported by documentation.

Next, I need to evaluate the potential consequences of the CPA's failure to inquire about documentation. If the CPA does not verify the existence of documentation for business travel expenses, they may be considered negligent in their duties.

Finally, I analyze the choices. The CPA's lack of inquiry could lead to a tax return preparer penalty for failing to exercise due diligence. However, this does not necessarily mean the CPA prepared a fraudulent return, nor does it absolve the client of penalties if the expenses are disallowed.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to determine the proper accounting treatment for equipment used in research and development (R&D) activities that will have alternative future uses. 

Next, if the equipment has alternative future uses, it is not solely dedicated to the R&D project. Therefore, the cost of the equipment should not be expensed entirely in the year the R&D project starts. Instead, it should be capitalized.

Finally, the equipment should be depreciated over its estimated useful life, as it will be used beyond the R&D project. This aligns with proper accounting principles.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to calculate the total liabilities of both King and Simmon before any adjustments. King’s liabilities are $450,000, and Simmon’s liabilities are $200,000, so the combined total is $450,000 + $200,000 = $650,000.

Next, I need to eliminate the intercompany liability. Simmon’s $100,000 note payable to King is an intercompany transaction, so it should not be included in the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, I subtract $100,000 from the combined total liabilities.

Finally, the adjusted total liabilities to be reported in the consolidated financial statements are $650,000 - $100,000 = $550,000.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the choices step by step:

1. **Choice a: Customers who have credit or zero balances with the client.**  
   This is unlikely to be categorized as an ""exception"" because credit or zero balances are not unusual and do not necessarily indicate an issue with the accounts receivable confirmation.

2. **Choice b: Responses that were mailed rather than faxed to the auditor.**  
   The method of response (mail or fax) does not inherently create an ""exception."" The content of the response is what matters, not the delivery method.

3. **Choice c: Accounts receivable that have been classified as uncollectible.**  
   Uncollectible accounts are typically written off and would not be part of the accounts receivable confirmation process. Therefore, this is not likely to be the reason for an ""exception.""

4. **Choice d: Payments mailed to the client that have not been recorded.**  
   This is a likely reason for an ""exception"" because the customer may confirm a lower balance than what is recorded in the client's books due to a payment that has not yet been recorded by the client. This discrepancy would be flagged as an exception during the confirmation process.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will analyze the definitions of accruals and deferrals step by step:

1. Accruals refer to revenues earned or expenses incurred that have not yet been received or paid in cash. They are concerned with expected future cash receipts and payments for transactions that have already occurred.
2. Deferrals refer to cash received or paid in advance for revenues or expenses that will be recognized in the future. They are concerned with past cash receipts and payments for transactions that will occur later.
3. Based on these definitions, accruals deal with expected future cash flows, while deferrals deal with past cash flows.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the role of the accountant in a compilation engagement. In a compilation, the accountant assists in presenting financial information without providing assurance on the financial statements. However, if the financial statements contain significant misapplications of accounting principles and unreasonable estimates, the accountant must evaluate whether continuing the engagement is appropriate.

Next, since management is unwilling to revise the financial statements and the accountant believes that modifying the standard compilation report is not sufficient to address the deficiencies, the accountant must consider professional and ethical responsibilities. The accountant cannot be associated with financial statements that are misleading or materially misstated.

Finally, under these circumstances, the accountant's best course of action is to withdraw from the engagement. This ensures that the accountant does not associate their name with financial statements that contain significant deficiencies and that cannot be adequately addressed through report modifications.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which of the options cannot be amortized for tax purposes, let's analyze each step:

1. **Incorporation costs**: These are typically considered organizational costs and can be amortized over a specific period for tax purposes.
2. **Temporary directors’ fees**: These are generally considered compensation expenses and are not classified as organizational costs. Therefore, they cannot be amortized for tax purposes.
3. **Stock issuance costs**: These are capitalized and reduce the proceeds from the stock issuance but are not amortized for tax purposes.
4. **Organizational meeting costs**: These are part of organizational costs and can be amortized over a specific period for tax purposes.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the definitions of the options provided.  
- Measuring the performance gap refers to identifying the difference between current performance and desired performance.  
- Standard measurement involves setting a fixed standard for comparison.  
- Benchmarking is the process of comparing a business's products, services, or processes against the best practices or standards in the industry.  
- Variance management focuses on identifying and addressing deviations from expected outcomes.  

Next, I need to identify which option aligns with the process of evaluating performance relative to the best possible levels. Benchmarking specifically involves comparing against the best practices or top performers, making it the most suitable choice.  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate step by step:

1. The contribution margin is 20% of the selling price. This means the contribution margin per unit is 20% of $19.00, which is $19.00 × 0.20 = $3.80.

2. The contribution margin is the selling price minus all variable costs (variable manufacturing costs + variable selling and distribution costs). Therefore, the total variable costs per unit must be $19.00 - $3.80 = $15.20.

3. The variable selling and distribution costs are $3.00 per unit. Subtracting this from the total variable costs gives the target variable manufacturing cost: $15.20 - $3.00 = $12.20.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to adjust the pretax income for the errors. An overstated ending inventory increases income, so I need to subtract $30,000 from the reported pretax income. 

Next, an understated depreciation expense decreases income, so I need to subtract $64,000 from the reported pretax income as well.

Finally, I calculate the correct pretax income by subtracting both adjustments from the reported pretax income of $152,500: $152,500 - $30,000 - $64,000 = $58,500.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Due care**: This is a valid defense in a negligence case. If the CPA can demonstrate that they exercised due care and followed professional standards, they may not be found negligent.

2. **Ignorance of the law**: This is not a valid defense. Ignorance of the law is generally not an acceptable excuse for negligence.

3. **Lack of intent**: Negligence does not require intent; it is based on a failure to exercise reasonable care. Therefore, lack of intent is not a valid defense.

4. **Lack of mental capacity**: This is not a typical defense in a negligence case involving a CPA. Mental capacity is not usually relevant unless it directly impacts the CPA's ability to perform their duties.

The most likely successful defense is **due care**.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the MACRS depreciation system and the sale timing**:  
   - Baker purchased the equipment on May 1 of the prior year, so the first year of depreciation (20%) was taken in the prior year.  
   - In the current year, Baker sold the equipment on March 1, which is before the end of the second year. Under MACRS, a mid-year convention is applied, meaning only half of the second year's depreciation (32%) can be deducted in the year of sale.

2. **Calculate the full second-year depreciation**:  
   - The cost of the equipment is $10,000.  
   - The second-year depreciation rate is 32%.  
   - Full second-year depreciation = $10,000 × 32% = $3,200.

3. **Apply the mid-year convention**:  
   - Since the equipment was sold in the middle of the year, only half of the second-year depreciation can be deducted.  
   - Depreciation for the current year = $3,200 ÷ 2 = $1,600.

Thus, the amount of depreciation Baker can deduct in the current year is **$1,600**.

"To solve this:

1. The accountant is engaged to review financial statements under Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS). SSARS allows financial statements to be prepared on a comprehensive basis of accounting other than GAAP, as long as it is disclosed.
2. The accountant would not withdraw from the engagement (choice a) because using another comprehensive basis of accounting is permissible under SSARS.
3. The accountant would not require adjustments to conform to GAAP (choice b) because the engagement allows for other comprehensive bases of accounting.
4. The accountant would modify the review report (choice c) to disclose that the financial statements are prepared on another comprehensive basis of accounting, as required by SSARS.
5. While management may justify the use of the other basis (choice d), the primary action is to modify the report to reflect this basis.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine how the city of Cobb should report each trust fund, let's analyze the characteristics of each fund:

1. Trust fund A: Only the earnings (interest) can be expended, while the principal must remain intact. This aligns with the definition of a **Permanent Fund**, which is used to report resources that are restricted to the extent that only earnings, and not principal, may be used for purposes that support the reporting government's programs.

2. Trust fund B: Both the principal and interest can be expended. This does not meet the criteria for a Permanent Fund. Instead, it aligns with a **Special Revenue Fund**, which is used to account for specific revenue sources that are restricted or committed to expenditure for specified purposes.

Thus, the correct reporting is:
- Trust fund A: Permanent Fund
- Trust fund B: Special Revenue Fund

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate the inventory levels before and after the improvement in inventory turnover and determine the change in funds.

1. Inventory turnover (IT) is calculated as IT = COGS / Average Inventory. Rearranging, Average Inventory = COGS / IT.
   - Initially, IT = 5, so Average Inventory = $800,000 / 5 = $160,000.
   - After improvement, IT = 8, so Average Inventory = $800,000 / 8 = $100,000.

2. The change in inventory is the difference between the initial and improved inventory levels.
   - Change in Inventory = $160,000 - $100,000 = $60,000.

3. Since the inventory level decreased, $60,000 is released.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a**: ""Management is responsible for reporting to us any inadequate provisions for the safeguarding of assets.""  
   - This is not a typical statement in an auditor's engagement letter. While management is responsible for safeguarding assets, the engagement letter usually focuses on the auditor's responsibilities and management's responsibilities related to financial reporting, not specifically on reporting inadequate provisions.

2. **Option b**: ""We will identify internal controls relevant to specific assertions that may prevent or detect material misstatements.""  
   - While auditors do consider internal controls as part of their audit process, this statement is too specific and not typically included in an engagement letter. Engagement letters generally outline the scope of the audit and responsibilities, not detailed procedures.

3. **Option c**: ""Management agrees to correct all deficiencies in internal control activities identified by us.""  
   - This is not a standard statement in an engagement letter. Auditors may report deficiencies to management, but it is not their role to require management to agree to correct them.

4. **Option d**: ""Management is responsible for making all financial records and related information available to us.""  
   - This is a standard statement in an auditor's engagement letter. It outlines management's responsibility to provide the auditor with access to all necessary financial records and information, which is essential for conducting the audit.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate each option to determine which factor would most likely cause a CPA not to accept a new audit engagement.  
- Option a: Management's reputation for failing to provide schedules to prior auditors on time may raise concerns but does not necessarily prevent the CPA from accepting the engagement.  
- Option b: The inability to review the predecessor auditor's working papers could be a challenge but is not a definitive reason to decline the engagement.  
- Option c: Management's unwillingness to make all financial records available is a significant issue because it impairs the CPA's ability to perform the audit and obtain sufficient evidence.  
- Option d: A lack of understanding of the entity's operations and industry can be addressed through research and preparation, so it is not a valid reason to decline the engagement.  

The most critical factor is management's unwillingness to provide access to financial records, as it directly impacts the CPA's ability to perform the audit.  

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the elements required to prove an accountant liable for common law fraud:

1. Common law fraud involves intentional deception. The client must prove ""scienter,"" which means the accountant knowingly made a false statement or acted with reckless disregard for the truth.
2. The client must also demonstrate ""justifiable reliance,"" meaning they reasonably relied on the accountant's misrepresentation.
3. Other options, such as breach of contract or privity, are not elements of fraud but may relate to other legal claims.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: In periods of rising prices, the LIFO method results in a lower cost of sales and higher taxable income, when compared to the FIFO method.  
   - This is incorrect. In periods of rising prices, LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) results in higher cost of sales because the most recent (and more expensive) inventory is used first. This leads to lower taxable income compared to FIFO.

2. **Option b**: The taxpayer is required to receive permission each year from the Internal Revenue Service to continue the use of the LIFO method.  
   - This is incorrect. While the taxpayer must initially receive permission from the IRS to adopt the LIFO method, they do not need to request permission every year to continue using it.

3. **Option c**: The LIFO method can be used for tax purposes even if the FIFO method is used for financial statement purposes.  
   - This is incorrect. The IRS requires that if a taxpayer uses the LIFO method for tax purposes, they must also use it for financial reporting purposes. This is known as the ""LIFO conformity rule.""

4. **Option d**: Under the LIFO method, the inventory on hand at the end of the year is treated as being composed of the earliest acquired goods.  
   - This is correct. Under the LIFO method, the most recent inventory is sold first, leaving the oldest inventory as the ending inventory.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold, let's calculate step by step:

1. **Initial purchase**: Lemon purchased 2000 shares at $10.50 per share. The total cost basis for these shares is 2000 × $10.50 = $21,000.

2. **5% stock dividend in year 4**: A 5% stock dividend means Lemon received an additional 5% of 2000 shares, which is 2000 × 0.05 = 100 shares. After the dividend, Lemon now owns 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The total cost basis remains $21,000, but the per-share basis is adjusted: $21,000 ÷ 2100 = $10.00 per share.

3. **2-for-1 stock split in year 5**: A 2-for-1 stock split doubles the number of shares Lemon owns. After the split, Lemon owns 2100 × 2 = 4200 shares. The total cost basis is still $21,000, but the per-share basis is further adjusted: $21,000 ÷ 4200 = $5.00 per share.

4. **Selling 800 shares in the current year**: The basis for the 800 shares sold is 800 × $5.00 = $4,000.

"First, I need to identify which characteristic is most likely to increase the risk of material misstatements due to fraudulent financial reporting. Fraudulent financial reporting often involves intentional misstatements or omissions to deceive users of financial statements.

Next, I will evaluate each option:
a) Declining customer demand in the entity's industry could pressure management to manipulate financial results to appear more favorable, increasing the risk of fraudulent reporting.
b) Employees not being bonded relates more to misappropriation of assets (fraudulent activities like theft) rather than fraudulent financial reporting.
c) In-transit deposits in bank reconciliations are a normal part of operations and do not directly indicate a heightened risk of fraudulent financial reporting.
d) Selling equipment at a loss before full depreciation may indicate poor asset management but does not directly suggest fraudulent financial reporting.

Finally, the characteristic most likely to heighten concern about fraudulent financial reporting is declining customer demand, as it creates pressure on management to manipulate financial results.

"First, I need to determine the context of the question. The auditor is testing internal control activities related to the proper approval of purchase orders. If a voided purchase order is selected, the auditor needs to decide whether to replace it with another purchase order.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. If the voided purchase order has been properly voided in the normal course of business, it does not provide relevant evidence for testing the control activity. Therefore, the auditor would replace it with another purchase order.

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the question step by step:

1. The scenario involves an agreed-upon procedures engagement, where the CPA (Mill) is engaged to perform specific procedures and report findings based on those procedures. In such engagements, the CPA does not provide an opinion or assurance but instead reports the results of the procedures performed.

2. The report for an agreed-upon procedures engagement typically includes a description of the procedures performed and the findings resulting from those procedures. The sufficiency of the procedures is determined by the specified parties, not the CPA.

3. Based on the choices:
   - a) A disclaimer of opinion about the fair presentation of financial statements is not relevant here because this is not an audit or review engagement.
   - b) A list of the procedures performed and the findings is a key component of an agreed-upon procedures report.
   - c) An opinion about the effectiveness of internal control is not provided in an agreed-upon procedures engagement.

"To determine the recognized gain or loss, I need to consider the basis rules for gifted property. 

1. When a gift is made, the recipient's basis depends on whether the property is sold for a gain or a loss. If the property is sold for more than the donor's basis, the gain is calculated using the donor's basis. If the property is sold for less than the fair market value (FMV) at the time of the gift, the loss is calculated using the FMV. If the sale price falls between the donor's basis and the FMV, there is no gain or loss.

2. In this case, the donor's basis is $40,000, and the FMV at the time of the gift is $30,000. The child sells the stock for $36,000, which falls between the donor's basis ($40,000) and the FMV ($30,000).

3. Since the sale price is between the donor's basis and the FMV, there is no recognized gain or loss.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which investment Goll Co. should account for using the equity method, I need to consider the following:

1. The equity method is typically used when an investor has significant influence over the investee. Significant influence is generally presumed when the investor owns 20% to 50% of the voting stock of the investee, unless evidence suggests otherwise.

2. Goll Co. has a 25% interest in Rose Co., which falls within the range where significant influence is presumed. However, the problem explicitly states that Goll does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over Rose Co.'s operating and financial policies. Therefore, the equity method would not apply to Rose Co.

3. Goll Co. has an 18% interest in Jave Co., which is below the 20% threshold for presumed significant influence. Additionally, the problem states that Goll does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over Jave Co. Thus, the equity method would not apply to Jave Co either.

4. Since Goll does not have significant influence over either Rose Co. or Jave Co., neither investment should be accounted for using the equity method.

2. Accord and satisfaction (b) is a mutual agreement to accept different performance, which also does not occur by operation of law.
3. Anticipatory repudiation (c) occurs when one party indicates they will not perform, but this does not discharge duties by operation of law; it allows the other party to seek remedies.

1. **Option a**: Examining a cutoff bank statement for deposits recorded in the books but not by the bank is more related to verifying cash balances and reconciling timing differences, not specifically searching for unrecorded liabilities.

2. **Option b**: Reviewing details of accounts receivable confirmations classified as ""exceptions"" pertains to verifying accounts receivable balances and ensuring proper revenue recognition, not liabilities.

3. **Option c**: Files of purchase requisitions for items ordered just before year-end may indicate potential liabilities, but purchase requisitions alone do not confirm that a liability exists, as they are not evidence of receipt or obligation.

"To calculate Merritt's weighted-average cost of capital (WACC), I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the after-tax cost of debt**: The pretax cost of debt is 5%, and the tax rate is 21%. The after-tax cost of debt is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{After-tax cost of debt} = \text{Pretax cost of debt} \times (1 - \text{Tax rate}) = 5\% \times (1 - 0.21) = 5\% \times 0.79 = 3.95\%.
   \]

2. **Determine the weights of equity and debt**: The capital structure is 20% common equity and 80% debt. Thus, the weight of equity (\(w_e\)) is 0.20, and the weight of debt (\(w_d\)) is 0.80.

3. **Calculate the WACC**: The WACC formula is:
   \[
   \text{WACC} = (w_e \times \text{Cost of equity}) + (w_d \times \text{After-tax cost of debt}).
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{WACC} = (0.20 \times 10\%) + (0.80 \times 3.95\%) = 2\% + 3.16\% = 5.16\%.

"First, I need to calculate the initial basis of Greene in Seagull, which is $15,000 at the beginning of the year.  

Next, I adjust the basis for the income and losses. The ordinary loss of $5,000 reduces the basis, and the municipal bond interest of $2,000 increases the basis. So, the adjusted basis is $15,000 - $5,000 + $2,000 = $12,000.  

Finally, I account for the cash distribution of $6,000, which reduces the basis further. The final basis is $12,000 - $6,000 = $6,000.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The error relates to a failure to report $40,000 of depreciation in the prior year. This is an accounting error that needs to be corrected retrospectively, not as a current-year expense. The correction should adjust the accumulated depreciation account directly.

2. The tax rate is 20%, but this does not affect the amount of accumulated depreciation. The tax impact would be reflected in retained earnings, not in the accumulated depreciation account.

3. The correct adjustment is to increase accumulated depreciation by the full $40,000, as this reflects the amount of depreciation that was missed in the prior year.

"First, I need to evaluate each option to determine which factor would most likely cause an accountant not to accept the engagement.

1. Option a) A lack of segregation of duties in the entity's accounting and payroll departments: This is a common internal control weakness, but it does not necessarily prevent an accountant from accepting a compilation engagement, as the accountant is not required to audit or review internal controls in a compilation.

2. Option b) Indications that reports of asset misappropriation are not investigated by management: This could indicate a significant ethical or fraud issue. If the accountant believes that management lacks integrity or is involved in fraudulent activities, they may decide not to accept the engagement.

3. Option c) The entity's intention to omit from the financial statements substantially all of the disclosures required by GAAP: This is allowed in a compilation engagement as long as the omission is disclosed in the accountant's report and the omission is not intended to mislead users.

4. Option d) Management's acknowledgement that the financial statements will be included in a written personal financial plan: This does not prevent the accountant from accepting the engagement, as it is simply a use of the financial statements.

Based on the analysis, the most likely factor that would cause an accountant not to accept the engagement is b), as it raises concerns about management's integrity and ethical behavior.

"To solve this, I will analyze each option step by step to determine which one correctly illustrates the doctrine of substantial performance:

1. **Option a**: Blair ordered blue chairs, but Kyle delivered red chairs. This is not substantial performance because the delivered product (red chairs) is entirely different from what was ordered (blue chairs). This would likely be considered a breach of contract.

2. **Option b**: Leslie painted an entire room but failed to put the electrical outlet covers back on. This could be an example of substantial performance because the main obligation (painting the room) was completed, and the failure to replace the outlet covers is a minor, non-material issue that does not defeat the purpose of the contract.

3. **Option c**: A contract required hair styling to Toby's satisfaction, but Toby was dissatisfied in good faith. This does not illustrate substantial performance because the contract explicitly required Toby's satisfaction, and Toby was not satisfied. The doctrine of substantial performance does not apply when satisfaction is a condition of the contract.

4. **Option d**: A dentist extracted the wrong tooth. This is not substantial performance because the dentist failed to fulfill the primary obligation of the contract, which was to extract the correct tooth. This would be a significant breach.

"To solve this, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. Option a) suggests that deviations from controls do not affect the risk of material misstatement. This is incorrect because deviations from controls can increase the risk of material misstatement.

2. Option b) states that deviations from controls at a given rate usually result in misstatements at a lower rate. This is correct because not all control deviations lead to misstatements, but they do indicate a potential risk.

3. Option c) claims that a high degree of assurance allows for a high level of sampling risk. This is incorrect because a high degree of assurance requires a low level of sampling risk.

4. Option d) suggests that increasing the sample size increases the tolerable rate of deviations. This is incorrect because the tolerable rate of deviations is determined by the auditor's judgment and the importance of the control, not the sample size.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To calculate the beta of Stock A, we use the formula:

Beta = Covariance(Stock A, Market) / Variance(Market)

Step 1: The covariance between Stock A and the market index is given as 88. The standard deviation of the market index is 14%, so the variance of the market is (14%)² = 0.14² = 0.0196.

Step 2: Plug the values into the formula for beta:
Beta = 88 / 0.0196.

Step 3: Perform the division:
Beta = 88 ÷ 0.0196 = 4,489.8.

This result seems incorrect, as the beta value is unusually high. Upon reviewing the problem, it appears there may be a misunderstanding in the units of covariance or standard deviation. Please clarify the units or confirm the data provided."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the rules for Code Sec. 1244 stock losses**: Code Sec. 1244 allows individuals to deduct losses on qualifying small business stock as ordinary losses, up to $50,000 per year for single taxpayers. Any excess loss is treated as a capital loss.

2. **Determine the carryover from the net operating loss (NOL)**: Summer had a $20,000 NOL from three years ago, of which three-fourths ($15,000) was attributable to a Code Sec. 1244 stock loss. This $15,000 retains its character as an ordinary loss under Code Sec. 1244 when carried forward to the current year.

3. **Calculate the current year's Code Sec. 1244 stock loss**: In the current year, Summer sustains another $50,000 loss on Code Sec. 1244 stock. The total potential ordinary loss for the current year is the sum of the carried-over $15,000 and the current year's $50,000 loss, which equals $65,000.

4. **Apply the $50,000 annual limit for ordinary losses**: Code Sec. 1244 limits the deduction of ordinary losses to $50,000 per year for single taxpayers. Therefore, Summer can deduct $50,000 as an ordinary loss. The remaining $15,000 ($65,000 - $50,000) is treated as a capital loss.

Thus, the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss that Summer can deduct for the current year is **$50,000 ordinary loss**.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the situation**: Stark Co. is involved in a lawsuit, and its legal counsel believes it is ""reasonably possible"" (not ""probable"") that there will be an unfavorable outcome. The potential damages range from $100,000 to $150,000.

2. **Accounting rules for contingencies**: According to accounting standards (e.g., ASC 450 in U.S. GAAP), a contingent liability should be accrued (recorded in the financial statements) only if the loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated. If the loss is only ""reasonably possible"" (not probable), it should not be accrued but should instead be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

3. **Application to this case**: Since the outcome is ""reasonably possible"" and not ""probable,"" Stark should not accrue any amount for the contingent liability. However, Stark should disclose the range of possible damages ($100,000 to $150,000) in the notes to the financial statements.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the amount of revenues Best County should report in its capital projects fund, let's analyze the receipts step by step:

1. **Transfer from the general fund ($100,000):** Transfers from other funds are not considered revenues. They are classified as ""other financing sources."" Therefore, this amount is excluded from the revenue calculation.

2. **Federal capital grant ($75,000):** Grants received for capital projects are considered revenues. Thus, this amount is included in the revenue calculation.

3. **Special assessment for capital improvements ($300,000):** Special assessments for capital improvements are also considered revenues. Therefore, this amount is included in the revenue calculation.

4. **Total revenues:** Adding the federal capital grant ($75,000) and the special assessment ($300,000), the total revenues are $75,000 + $300,000 = $375,000.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to determine the primary responsibility of an accountant before compiling financial statements for a nonissuer. Compilation engagements do not require the accountant to verify the accuracy of the information provided or perform audit-like procedures.

Next, I need to evaluate each option. Option a involves verifying financial information, which is not required in a compilation. Option b involves analytical procedures, which are not part of a compilation. Option c involves inquiries about adjusting and closing procedures, which are not necessary for a compilation. Option d involves understanding specialized financial reporting frameworks, which is essential for preparing accurate financial statements.

Finally, based on the requirements of a compilation engagement, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the situation where the client has a valid reason for not confirming a specific account receivable. The auditor must address this situation by performing alternative procedures to verify the account balance.

Next, alternative procedures typically involve inspecting supporting documentation, such as the client's bank statements and cash receipt records, to verify the existence and accuracy of the account balance.

Finally, the auditor should not simply select another account for confirmation or rely solely on management's representation. The auditor also does not need to disclaim an opinion solely based on this request if alternative procedures can provide sufficient evidence.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the amount of contingent liability Dari Inc. should accrue, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the range of probable loss**: Dari Inc. has determined that it is probable it will be required to pay between $150,000 and $200,000. This means the loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, which are the criteria for accruing a liability under accounting standards.

2. **Determine the amount to accrue**: When no amount within the range is more likely than any other, the minimum amount in the range ($150,000) should be accrued as the liability. This is in accordance with accounting guidance (e.g., U.S. GAAP ASC 450).

3. **Conclusion**: Dari Inc. should accrue $150,000 as the contingent liability in its December 31 balance sheet.

"First, I need to identify the problem described in the question. The manager is dealing with limited capacity for the operation of a critical machine, which is a bottleneck in the process.

Next, I need to evaluate the decision-making techniques provided in the choices:
- Theory of constraints focuses on identifying and managing bottlenecks to improve overall system performance.
- Economic order quantity is related to inventory management and does not address capacity issues.
- Balanced scorecard is a strategic management tool for tracking performance metrics, not specifically for addressing bottlenecks.
- Cost-variance analysis is used to compare actual costs to budgeted costs, which does not directly address capacity constraints.

Finally, the most appropriate technique for addressing the bottleneck and increasing profitability is the theory of constraints.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

"To solve this, let's analyze step by step:

1. The cost of equity is influenced by the inflation premium. If the inflation rate decreases, the inflation premium in the required rate of return (cost of equity) will also decrease. This means the cost of equity will likely decrease.

2. A lower cost of equity reduces the discount rate used in valuing the stock. Since the stock price is inversely related to the discount rate, a lower cost of equity will likely lead to an increase in the stock price.

3. Therefore, the correct answer is that the cost of equity will likely decrease as a result of the change in the inflation premium.

"To solve this, I will use the formula for the standard deviation of a two-asset portfolio:

1. The formula for the portfolio standard deviation is:
   \[
   \sigma_p = \sqrt{w_A^2 \sigma_A^2 + w_B^2 \sigma_B^2 + 2 w_A w_B \rho \sigma_A \sigma_B}
   \]
   where:
   - \(w_A\) and \(w_B\) are the weights of Stocks A and B in the portfolio,
   - \(\sigma_A\) and \(\sigma_B\) are the standard deviations of Stocks A and B,
   - \(\rho\) is the correlation between Stocks A and B.

2. Since the portfolio is equally weighted, \(w_A = w_B = 0.5\). Substituting the given values:
   - \(\sigma_A = 6\% = 0.06\),
   - \(\sigma_B = 18\% = 0.18\),
   - \(\rho = 0.2\).

3. Substituting into the formula:
   \[
   \sigma_p = \sqrt{(0.5)^2 (0.06)^2 + (0.5)^2 (0.18)^2 + 2 (0.5)(0.5)(0.2)(0.06)(0.18)}
   \]

4. Simplify each term:
   - \((0.5)^2 (0.06)^2 = 0.25 \times 0.0036 = 0.0009\),
   - \((0.5)^2 (0.18)^2 = 0.25 \times 0.0324 = 0.0081\),
   - \(2 (0.5)(0.5)(0.2)(0.06)(0.18) = 0.5 \times 0.2 \times 0.06 \times 0.18 = 0.00108\).

5. Add these terms:
   \[
   \sigma_p^2 = 0.0009 + 0.0081 + 0.00108 = 0.01008

"To determine the foreign currency gain Mentor should recognize in its income statement, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the difference between remeasurement and translation**: 
   - Remeasurement gains or losses occur when the financial statements of a foreign subsidiary are converted into the functional currency (Swiss franc in this case) using historical exchange rates for non-monetary items and current exchange rates for monetary items. These gains or losses are recognized in the income statement.
   - Translation gains or losses occur when the financial statements of a foreign subsidiary are translated from the functional currency (Swiss franc) to the reporting currency (U.S. dollar). These gains or losses are reported in other comprehensive income (OCI), not in the income statement.

2. **Identify the relevant amounts**:
   - The remeasurement resulted in a $25,000 gain, which is recognized in the income statement.
   - The translation resulted in a $40,000 gain, which is reported in OCI and not in the income statement.

3. **Determine the amount to recognize in the income statement**:
   - Only the remeasurement gain of $25,000 is recognized in the income statement. The translation gain of $40,000 is excluded from the income statement.

Thus, the foreign currency gain Mentor should recognize in its income statement is $25,000.

"First, I need to calculate the cost of production in U.S. dollars. The product costs 116.50 pesos to produce, and 0.1099 U.S. dollars are required to buy one peso. So, the cost in U.S. dollars is 116.50 * 0.1099 = 12.80 dollars.

Next, I need to calculate the revenue in U.S. dollars. The product sells for 20 euros, and 0.8928 U.S. dollars are required to buy one euro. So, the revenue in U.S. dollars is 20 * 0.8928 = 17.86 dollars.

Finally, I calculate the profit by subtracting the cost from the revenue: 17.86 - 12.80 = 5.06 dollars.

"First, I need to determine the unrealized gain or loss by comparing the fair value of the securities to their cost basis. The fair value is $30,000, and the cost basis is $24,000, so the unrealized gain is $30,000 - $24,000 = $6,000.

Next, I need to consider how unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities are reported. Unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities are not recognized in the income statement; instead, they are reported in other comprehensive income (OCI).

Since unrealized gains or losses are not recognized in the income statement, the amount to be recognized in the income statement is $0.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the key differences between equity (stocks) and bonds. Equity represents ownership in a company, while bonds are debt instruments issued by a company or government.

Next, I analyze the options:
- a) Both equity and bonds can be issued by firms, so this is not unique to equity.
- b) Dividends (equity payouts) are made after corporation tax has been deducted, while bond interest (coupon payments) is typically tax-deductible and paid before corporation tax. This is true for equity but not for bonds.
- c) This is true for bonds, not equity, as bond interest is paid before corporation tax.
- d) Both equity and bonds can be traded on the secondary market, so this is not unique to equity.

"To determine Strom's basis in Ace, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the initial basis of the contributed property**: Strom's adjusted basis in the land is $16,000. This is the starting point for determining his basis in the partnership.

2. **Adjust for the mortgage assumed by the partnership**: The $24,000 mortgage on the land is assumed by Ace Partnership. Under partnership tax rules, the partner's basis is reduced by the amount of the liability assumed by the partnership. However, Strom is still responsible for his share of the partnership's liabilities. Since Strom owns a 25% interest in Ace, he is allocated 25% of the $24,000 mortgage, which is $6,000. Therefore, the net reduction to Strom's basis is $24,000 - $6,000 = $18,000.

3. **Calculate Strom's final basis**: Start with the adjusted basis of $16,000, then subtract the net reduction of $18,000. This results in a basis of $16,000 - $18,000 = **$0**. A partner's basis cannot be negative, so the final basis is $0.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

"To solve this, I will calculate the contribution margin for both products, determine the weighted average contribution margin based on the sales mix, and then calculate the break-even point in terms of DVD players.

1. **Calculate the contribution margin for each product**:
   - For DVD players: Selling price = $200, Variable cost = $160, Contribution margin = $200 - $160 = $40.
   - For home entertainment systems: Selling price = $600, Variable cost = $460, Contribution margin = $600 - $460 = $140.

2. **Determine the sales mix and weighted average contribution margin**:
   - The company sells 1 home entertainment system for every 4 DVD players. This means the sales mix is 4 DVD players : 1 home entertainment system.
   - Total contribution margin for 4 DVD players and 1 home entertainment system = (4 × $40) + (1 × $140) = $160 + $140 = $300.
   - Weighted average contribution margin per unit = $300 ÷ (4 + 1) = $300 ÷ 5 = $60.

3. **Calculate the break-even point in terms of total units and DVD players**:
   - Break-even point in total units = Fixed costs ÷ Weighted average contribution margin = $90,000 ÷ $60 = 1,500 total units.
   - Since 4 out of every 5 units sold are DVD players, the number of DVD players sold = (4/5) × 1,500 = 1,200 DVD players.

"To solve this, I will follow these steps:

1. The formula for return on total assets (ROA) is:  
   ROA = Net Income / Total Assets.  
   Given ROA is 8% and Total Assets are $300,000, we can calculate Net Income:  
   Net Income = ROA × Total Assets = 0.08 × $300,000 = $24,000.

2. The formula for net profit margin is:  
   Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Sales.  
   Given Net Profit Margin is 5% and Net Income is $24,000, we can calculate Sales:  
   Sales = Net Income / Net Profit Margin = $24,000 / 0.05 = $480,000.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the stock dividend**: A 30% stock dividend means the company will issue 30% more shares based on the current outstanding shares. Since there are 1,000 shares outstanding, the company will issue 1,000 × 30% = 300 new shares.

2. **Determine the par value of the new shares**: The par value of each share is $1. Therefore, the total par value of the 300 new shares is 300 × $1 = $300.

3. **Record the stock dividend**: When a stock dividend is declared, retained earnings are debited for the total par value of the new shares issued. In this case, retained earnings will be debited for $300.

Thus, the correct adjustment is that retained earnings is debited for $300.

"To determine the most difficult internal control issue for an auditor to detect, I will evaluate each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: If the accounting staff neglects the control due to increased transactions, this could be identified through audit procedures such as reviewing transaction logs, observing processes, or interviewing staff. This is not the most difficult to detect.

2. **Option b**: If the technology department writes a program that does not properly implement the control, this could be identified through IT audits, testing of the program, or reviewing the program's design and implementation. While it may require specialized knowledge, it is still detectable.

3. **Option c**: If two employees from different departments collude to circumvent an internal control, this would be very difficult to detect because collusion undermines segregation of duties and often leaves no clear audit trail. Auditors rely on the assumption that controls are followed, and collusion can bypass these controls without obvious evidence.

4. **Option d**: If someone erroneously disables edit checks in a software program, this could be detected through IT audits, system testing, or reviewing system change logs. While it may not be immediately obvious, it is still detectable with proper audit procedures.

Based on this analysis, the most difficult internal control issue for an auditor to detect is **option c**, as collusion between employees is inherently designed to bypass controls and is challenging to uncover without direct evidence or whistleblowing.

"To determine the most likely indicator of possible illegal acts, I will evaluate each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: Related party transactions, although properly disclosed, were pervasive during the year.  
   - Related party transactions are not inherently illegal if they are properly disclosed and conducted at arm's length. While pervasive related party transactions might raise concerns about governance or conflicts of interest, proper disclosure reduces the likelihood of illegal acts.  

2. **Option b**: The entity prepared several large checks payable to cash during the year.  
   - Large checks payable to cash are unusual and could indicate potential illegal acts, such as embezzlement, money laundering, or other fraudulent activities. This would raise significant concerns during an audit.  

3. **Option c**: Material internal control weaknesses previously reported to management were not corrected.  
   - While uncorrected internal control weaknesses are a serious issue, they do not directly indicate illegal acts. Instead, they increase the risk of errors or fraud but are not themselves evidence of illegal activity.  

4. **Option d**: The entity was a campaign contributor to several local political candidates during the year.  
   - Campaign contributions are not inherently illegal unless they violate campaign finance laws or are improperly disclosed. Without additional context, this does not directly suggest illegal acts.  

Based on the analysis, the most likely indicator of possible illegal acts is **option b**, as large checks payable to cash are unusual and could signify fraudulent or illegal activities.

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. The existence assertion focuses on verifying that the property, plant, and equipment (PPE) recorded in the financial statements actually exist. This typically involves physical inspection or vouching to supporting documentation.

2. Option a) involves obtaining a listing of current-year additions, vouching significant additions to original invoices, and determining that they have been placed in service. This procedure directly tests the existence of PPE by verifying that the additions are supported by documentation and are physically in use.

3. Option b) involves ensuring items are appropriately capitalized, which relates more to the valuation and classification assertions rather than existence.

4. Option c) involves verifying that items are recorded in the proper period, which primarily addresses the cutoff assertion rather than existence.

5. Option d) involves ensuring depreciation methods are applied consistently, which relates to the valuation and allocation assertion rather than existence.

Based on the analysis, the procedure in option a) is most aligned with testing the existence assertion.

"First, I need to determine the basis for the child when the securities are gifted. When a gift is made, the basis depends on whether the fair market value (FMV) at the time of the gift is less than the donor's adjusted basis. Here, the FMV ($9,000) is less than the parent's adjusted basis ($10,000).

Next, for determining the gain or loss when the child sells the securities, the basis is calculated as follows:
- If the securities are sold for more than the donor's adjusted basis, the basis is the donor's adjusted basis.
- If the securities are sold for less than the FMV at the time of the gift, the basis is the FMV.
- If the securities are sold for an amount between the FMV and the donor's adjusted basis, there is no gain or loss.

Finally, since the child sold the securities for $7,000, which is less than the FMV of $9,000, the child's basis for determining the loss is the FMV of $9,000.

"First, I need to evaluate the relationship between NPV (Net Present Value) and IRR (Internal Rate of Return) when comparing investment projects. NPV is sensitive to changes in the market rate, while IRR is the discount rate that makes the NPV equal to zero.

Next, I consider that the ranking of projects by NPV can change with variations in the market rate, as NPV depends on the discount rate. This makes option a incorrect.

Then, I analyze the IRR metric. IRR does not always agree with NPV, especially in cases of non-conventional cash flows or mutually exclusive projects. This makes option b incorrect.

Additionally, IRR can sometimes lead to different rankings of projects compared to NPV, particularly when projects have different scales or timing of cash flows. This makes option c incorrect.

Finally, while NPV is generally preferred for decision-making, relying on a single metric like NPV or IRR may not always provide a complete picture. This makes option d incorrect as well.

   Total relevant costs per unit = $60 + $10 + $40 = $110.

2. **Exclude irrelevant costs**: Fixed costs (fixed overhead of $30 per unit and the fixed licensing fee of $50,000) are not relevant because they do not change with the special order.

3. **Determine the lowest price**: The lowest price Match should accept is the total relevant costs per unit, which is $110.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the amount Pine Co. should capitalize as the cost of the completed factory building, I will follow these steps:

1. The cost of the land, including the purchase price, razing the old building, and title insurance/legal fees, is not part of the building cost. These costs are related to the land and should not be included in the building capitalization.

2. The costs directly related to the building include the architect's fees and the new building construction cost. These are the costs that should be capitalized as the cost of the completed factory building.

3. Add the architect's fees ($95,000) to the new building construction cost ($1,850,000) to determine the total cost to capitalize for the building.

The total cost to capitalize for the building is $95,000 + $1,850,000 = $1,945,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, under the revaluation model, any decrease in fair value below the original cost is recognized in profit or loss unless it reverses a previous revaluation surplus. In year 1, the $10,000 decrease (from $100,000 to $90,000) was recognized in profit or loss.

Next, in year 2, the fair value increased from $90,000 to $105,000, a total increase of $15,000. Of this increase, $10,000 reverses the previous decrease recognized in profit or loss, so it is recognized in profit or loss.

Finally, the remaining $5,000 increase (from $100,000 to $105,000) is recognized in other comprehensive income as a revaluation surplus.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the target selling price, we need to calculate the total variable costs and then use the target contribution margin to find the selling price.

1. First, calculate the total variable costs per unit:
   - Manufacturing variable cost = $12
   - Selling & admin variable cost = $3
   - Total variable costs = $12 + $3 = $15

2. The contribution margin is defined as (Selling Price - Variable Costs) / Selling Price. The target contribution margin is 20%, so:
   Contribution Margin = 20% = (Selling Price - $15) / Selling Price

3. Solve for the Selling Price:
   0.20 = (Selling Price - $15) / Selling Price  
   0.20 * Selling Price = Selling Price - $15  
   0.20 * Selling Price - Selling Price = -$15  
   -0.80 * Selling Price = -$15  
   Selling Price = $15 / 0.80 = $18.75

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, I will use the formula for the price of a stock under the Gordon Growth Model (a growing perpetuity):  
Price = Dividend * (1 + Growth Rate) / (Required Return - Growth Rate).  

Step 1: Rearrange the formula to solve for the growth rate (g).  
The formula becomes:  
Growth Rate = (Required Return - Dividend / Price) / (1 + Dividend / Price).  

Step 2: Plug in the given values.  
The last dividend (D₀) = $3, the required return (r) = 12% or 0.12, and the price (P) = $75.  
The formula simplifies to:  
Growth Rate = r - (D₀ / P).  

Step 3: Calculate the growth rate.  
Growth Rate = 0.12 - (3 / 75) = 0.12 - 0.04 = 0.08 or 8%.  

Thus, the dividend growth rate should be 8%.

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the requirements for financial statements prepared by a voluntary health and welfare nongovernmental not-for-profit organization:

1. **Functional Classification**: These organizations are required to report expenses by functional classification, which includes program services and supporting services (e.g., management and general, fundraising). This is essential to show how resources are used to achieve the organization's mission.

2. **Natural Classification**: They are also required to report expenses by natural classification, which includes categories such as salaries, rent, utilities, and supplies. This provides detailed information about the nature of the expenses.

3. **Requirement**: The financial statements must present expenses in both functional and natural classifications, either in the statement of activities, a separate statement, or in the notes to the financial statements.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which of the options would typically be classified as a capital asset for federal income tax purposes, let's analyze each choice step by step:

1. **Accounts receivable**: These are amounts owed to the business for goods or services provided. They are not considered capital assets because they are part of the ordinary operations of the business.

2. **Marketable securities**: These are investments such as stocks and bonds that are held for investment purposes. For federal income tax purposes, marketable securities are generally classified as capital assets.

3. **Machinery and equipment used in a business**: These are tangible assets used in the operation of the business. They are not considered capital assets because they are classified as property used in a trade or business.

4. **Inventory**: This includes goods held for sale in the ordinary course of business. Inventory is not considered a capital asset because it is part of the business's ordinary operations.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the most effective method to transmit a message of ethical behavior throughout an organization according to COSO:

1. COSO emphasizes the importance of leadership and tone at the top in fostering an ethical culture. Demonstrating ethical behavior by example is a direct and impactful way to communicate the importance of ethics.

2. Strengthening internal audit’s ability to deter and report improper behavior is important for monitoring and enforcement but is not the primary method for transmitting ethical behavior.

3. Removing pressures to meet unrealistic targets can help reduce unethical behavior but does not directly transmit a message of ethical behavior.

4. Specifying competence levels and requisite knowledge and skills is related to job performance but does not directly address the transmission of ethical behavior.

The most effective method is demonstrating appropriate behavior by example. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to determine how the insurance expense should be allocated under the accrual basis. The $240,000 insurance policy covers four years, so the annual expense is $240,000 ÷ 4 = $60,000 per year.

Next, since the policy was purchased in January of the prior year, one year of the policy has already expired, meaning $60,000 should be recognized as insurance expense for the prior year. The remaining $180,000 ($240,000 - $60,000) should be reported as a prepaid insurance asset.

Finally, the adjustment to switch from the cash basis to the accrual basis requires recognizing the $60,000 prior-year expense as a reduction to retained earnings, while recording the $180,000 prepaid insurance as an asset.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a) Disaster recovery capabilities and documented recovery procedures**: This concern is not unique to SaaS, as disaster recovery is a critical aspect of any IT system, whether in-house or SaaS.

2. **Option b) User credential setup and control over the actions that employees can perform**: This is also not unique to SaaS, as user credential management is required for both in-house applications and SaaS solutions.

3. **Option c) Allocation of software expenses and overhead charged to departments**: This is a general concern for any software solution, whether SaaS or in-house, as organizations need to allocate costs appropriately.

4. **Option d) Ownership of processed data and costs of data migrations**: This concern is unique to SaaS because, in a SaaS model, the data is stored and processed on the provider's infrastructure. This raises questions about data ownership and the potential costs of migrating data to or from the SaaS provider.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate each situation to determine if it impairs objectivity, integrity, or independence. 

a) Taking the client’s audit committee to Las Vegas for the weekend could impair independence as it involves a significant personal relationship and potential undue influence.  
b) A client taking the audit engagement team out to dinner at a renowned local restaurant is a common business courtesy and does not typically impair independence if it is reasonable and not excessive.  
c) Providing box seats for the season at a major league baseball franchise is a significant gift and could impair independence due to its value and potential influence.  
d) A two-day ski trip provided by the client could impair independence as it is a substantial benefit and could create a sense of obligation.

The situation that would not impair objectivity, integrity, or independence is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to consider the role of a service organization in the audit process. When an audit client uses a service organization, the user auditor typically relies on the service auditor's report to assess the controls at the service organization.

Next, I need to evaluate the options. Option (a) suggests reviewing the service auditor’s report, which is a standard and efficient approach. Option (b) adds outlining the accounting system in a memo, which is not a necessary step for efficiency. Option (c) involves auditing the service organization’s controls directly, which is not efficient as it duplicates the service auditor’s work. Option (d) also involves testing the service auditor’s work, which is unnecessary unless there are specific concerns.

Finally, the most efficient procedure is to review the service auditor’s report on controls placed in operation, as this provides sufficient evidence without duplicating efforts.

"To determine Vinton's basis in the apartment building, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount realized by Vinton in the exchange**:  
   Vinton's land had a fair market value (FMV) of $420,000, and the other party assumed Vinton's $100,000 mortgage. Therefore, the total amount realized by Vinton is $420,000 + $100,000 = $520,000.

2. **Determine the adjusted basis of the property given up**:  
   Vinton's land had an adjusted basis of $300,000.

3. **Calculate the gain realized in the exchange**:  
   The gain realized is the amount realized ($520,000) minus the adjusted basis of the land ($300,000). Thus, the gain realized is $520,000 - $300,000 = $220,000.

4. **Determine the basis of the apartment building received**:  
   In a like-kind exchange, the basis of the property received is generally the adjusted basis of the property given up, increased by any gain recognized and decreased by any money received (or liabilities assumed by the other party).  
   Vinton assumed the other party's $230,000 mortgage, which is treated as money received. Therefore, the basis of the apartment building is:  
   $300,000 (basis of land) + $230,000 (liabilities assumed by Vinton) - $100,000 (liabilities assumed by the other party) = $430,000.

Thus, Vinton's basis in the apartment building is **$430,000**.

"First, I need to determine the best method for obtaining evidence about the operating effectiveness of a control when there is no written documentation. 

Next, I consider that inquiry and observation are common methods used by auditors to evaluate controls when documentation is lacking. Inquiry involves asking personnel about the control, and observation involves watching the control in action.

Finally, I evaluate the other options. Mailing confirmations, analytical procedures, and recalculating balances are not directly related to assessing the operating effectiveness of a control without documentation.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To calculate Lake Trust's distributable net income (DNI), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total income**: Add the dividend income, taxable interest income, and capital gains. However, capital gains are allocable to corpus and are not included in DNI unless distributed. So, we only include the dividend income and taxable interest income:
   $2,500 (dividend income) + $2,000 (taxable interest income) = $4,500.

2. **Subtract allocable expenses**: Subtract the accounting fees and trustee fees, as they are allocable to income:
   $4,500 - $500 (accounting fees) - $750 (trustee fees) = $3,250.

3. **Exclude capital gains**: Since the capital gains are allocable to corpus and not distributed, they are not included in the DNI calculation.

Thus, Lake's distributable net income is $3,250.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a: The auditor lacks independence with respect to the entity.**
   - If the auditor lacks independence, they are prohibited from issuing any opinion, including a qualified opinion. Instead, they must disclaim an opinion. Therefore, this option is correct.

2. **Option b: Management prevents the auditor from observing the entity's inventory.**
   - If management prevents the auditor from observing inventory, this constitutes a scope limitation. The auditor may issue a qualified opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, depending on the materiality and pervasiveness of the limitation. Thus, this option does not apply.

3. **Option c: The entity omits the statement of cash flows from its financial statements.**
   - If the entity omits the statement of cash flows, the auditor may issue a qualified opinion due to a departure from GAAP. Therefore, this option does not apply.

4. **Option d: The auditor's report refers to the work of an actuary.**
   - Referring to the work of a specialist, such as an actuary, does not preclude the issuance of a qualified opinion. The auditor may still issue an unmodified or qualified opinion depending on the circumstances. Thus, this option does not apply.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a: The ineffectiveness of the entity's audit committee.**  
   While an ineffective audit committee can weaken internal controls, it is not considered an inherent limitation. Inherent limitations are those that exist regardless of how well the internal control system is designed or implemented.

2. **Option b: Collusion of employees in circumventing internal controls.**  
   Collusion is a classic example of an inherent limitation of internal control. Even the best-designed internal control systems can be bypassed if employees conspire to override them.

3. **Option c: The lack of resources to monitor internal controls.**  
   This is a resource issue rather than an inherent limitation. It reflects a management decision or constraint rather than a fundamental limitation of internal control systems.

4. **Option d: The complexity of the entity's electronic order processing system.**  
   While complexity can pose challenges, it is not inherently a limitation of internal control. Properly designed controls can address complexity.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the compensating balance requirement**:  
   The compensating balance is 15% of the total credit line of $500,000.  
   Compensating balance = 0.15 × $500,000 = $75,000.  

2. **Determine the usable funds**:  
   If the firm borrows $200,000, it must maintain the $75,000 compensating balance. Therefore, the usable funds are:  
   Usable funds = $200,000 - $75,000 = $125,000.  

3. **Calculate the interest on the borrowed amount**:  
   The interest rate on the borrowed amount is 10%.  
   Interest = 0.10 × $200,000 = $20,000.  

4. **Calculate the commitment fee on the unused portion**:  
   The unused portion of the credit line is $500,000 - $200,000 = $300,000.  
   Commitment fee = 0.01 × $300,000 = $3,000.  

5. **Determine the total cost of borrowing**:  
   Total cost = Interest + Commitment fee = $20,000 + $3,000 = $23,000.  

6. **Calculate the effective annual interest cost**:  
   The effective annual interest cost is the total cost divided by the usable funds:  
   Effective annual interest cost = $23,000 ÷ $125,000 = 0.184 or 18.4%.  

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct treatment of the $100,000 acquisition costs, I will analyze the options step by step:

1. Acquisition costs related to the purchase of net assets are not included in the cost of the acquired assets or goodwill under current accounting standards (e.g., ASC 805 for U.S. GAAP). Instead, these costs are treated as expenses.
2. Allocating the costs to nonmonetary assets (option a) is incorrect because acquisition costs are not part of the asset valuation.
3. Capitalizing the costs as part of goodwill (option b) is also incorrect because acquisition-related costs are not included in goodwill.
4. Capitalizing the costs as an other asset and amortizing them (option c) is not allowed under current standards.
5. Expensing the costs as incurred (option d) is correct because acquisition-related costs are recognized as expenses in the period incurred.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate the expected value to Smith step by step:

1. First, calculate the expected court award:
   - For the $100,000 award, the probability is 0.7, so the contribution to the expected value is $100,000 × 0.7 = $70,000.
   - For the $0 award, the probability is 0.3, so the contribution to the expected value is $0 × 0.3 = $0.
   - Adding these together, the expected court award is $70,000 + $0 = $70,000.

2. Next, calculate Smith's share of the award:
   - Smith receives a retainer of $20,000 regardless of the outcome.
   - For any award over $20,000, Smith receives 40% of the excess. The expected award over $20,000 is $70,000 - $20,000 = $50,000.
   - Smith's share of the excess is 40% × $50,000 = $20,000.
   - Adding the retainer, Smith's total expected revenue is $20,000 + $20,000 = $40,000.

3. Finally, subtract Smith's out-of-pocket expenditures:
   - Smith incurs $15,000 in expenditures, so the expected value to Smith is $40,000 - $15,000 = $25,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate the total cash inflows (coupons and selling price), subtract the initial investment, and then divide by the initial investment to find the holding period return.

1. **Calculate total cash inflows from coupons**: The bond pays 8% annual coupons on its face value of $100. This means the annual coupon is $8. Over three years, the total coupon payments received are $8 × 3 = $24.

2. **Add the selling price**: At the end of the third year, the bond is sold for $82. The total cash inflows are $24 (coupons) + $82 (selling price) = $106.

3. **Calculate the holding period return**: The initial investment was $104.1. The holding period return is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{HPR} = \frac{\text{Total cash inflows} - \text{Initial investment}}{\text{Initial investment}} = \frac{106 - 104.1}{104.1} = \frac{1.9}{104.1} \approx 0.0183 \text{ or } 1.83\%.

"To determine the value of the tax shield, I need to calculate the difference between the value of the firm and the value of the firm if unlevered, and then adjust for the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs.

1. The value of the tax shield before considering bankruptcy and agency costs is the difference between the value of the firm and its unlevered value: $5,000,000 - $4,780,000 = $220,000.
2. Since the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs is $360,000, it does not directly affect the tax shield calculation. The tax shield remains $220,000.
3. Therefore, the value of the tax shield is $220,000.

"First, I need to understand the situation. The sample results indicate that the sample rate of deviation plus the allowance for sampling risk exceeds the tolerable rate. This means the control is not operating effectively at the desired level.

Next, the auditor would need to respond to this finding. If the control is not reliable, the auditor would reduce reliance on the control and increase the assessed level of control risk.

Finally, reducing reliance on the control would lead to increased substantive testing to gather sufficient audit evidence. However, the most direct response is reducing planned reliance on the prescribed control.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

1. **Choice a**: Performing tests of controls is related to evaluating the effectiveness of internal controls, not directly assessing the objectivity of the internal auditor. This choice is not relevant to the question.

2. **Choice b**: Analyzing risk factors related to misstatements from asset misappropriation is part of assessing fraud risk, not specifically assessing the internal auditor's objectivity. This choice is also not relevant.

3. **Choice c**: Reviewing the internal auditor's reports to verify consistency between conclusions and procedures performed is more about evaluating the quality of the internal auditor's work, not their objectivity. This choice does not directly address objectivity.

"To determine the effects of issuing additional capital stock for cash on the given ratios or measures, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Total debt to total assets**: 
   - Issuing additional capital stock increases the company's equity, not its debt. The cash received increases total assets, but the total debt remains unchanged. 
   - As a result, the ratio of total debt to total assets decreases because the denominator (total assets) increases while the numerator (total debt) stays the same.

2. **Working capital**:
   - Working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities. When the company issues capital stock for cash, the cash received increases current assets, while current liabilities remain unchanged.
   - Therefore, working capital increases.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Total debt to total assets decreases, and working capital increases.

This is a key characteristic of an enterprise fund, as enterprise funds are typically used for activities where the costs of providing goods or services are recovered primarily through user fees.

3. Option c) refers to the activity being financed by debt secured partially by a pledge of net revenues from fees and charges. While this can be a characteristic of an enterprise fund, it is not the most significant factor in its classification.

4. Option d) states that laws or regulations require the activity’s costs to be recovered with taxes or similar revenues. This is more characteristic of a governmental fund, not an enterprise fund.

"To determine the correct amount of cash to report on Rune Co.'s December 31 balance sheet, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Start with the checkbook balance**: Rune's checkbook balance on December 31 is $10,000. This is the starting point for calculating the cash balance.

2. **Adjust for the postdated check**: The $4,000 check postdated January 3 is not available for use as of December 31. Therefore, it should not be included in the cash balance. Since it was not included in the checkbook balance, no adjustment is needed.

3. **Adjust for the NSF check**: The $1,000 check deposited on December 15 was included in the checkbook balance but was returned by the bank on December 30 as ""NSF"" (non-sufficient funds). This means the $1,000 is not actually available as cash on December 31. Therefore, we need to subtract $1,000 from the checkbook balance.

**Calculation**:
- Starting checkbook balance: $10,000
- Subtract NSF check: $10,000 - $1,000 = $9,000

Thus, the amount Rune should report as cash on its December 31 balance sheet is **$9,000**.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Start with the book income before federal income taxes**: The book income is $300,000.

2. **Adjust for tax-exempt income**: The $17,000 corporate bond interest income is tax-exempt and must be subtracted from book income to reconcile to taxable income. So, $300,000 - $17,000 = $283,000.

3. **Adjust for nondeductible expenses**: The $20,000 term life insurance premiums are nondeductible for tax purposes. This amount must be added back to the taxable income. So, $283,000 + $20,000 = $303,000.

Step 1: Identify the given values:
- Weight of Security A (\(w_A\)) = 0.25
- Weight of Security B (\(w_B\)) = 0.75
- Standard deviation of Security A (\(\sigma_A\)) = 8% = 0.08
- Standard deviation of Security B (\(\sigma_B\)) = 18% = 0.18
- Correlation between A and B (\(\rho_{A,B}\)) = -0.20

- \(0.75^2 \cdot 0.18^2 = 0.5625 \cdot 0.0324 = 0.018225\)
- \(2 \cdot 0.25 \cdot 0.75 \cdot 0.08 \cdot 0.18 \cdot -0.20 = 2 \cdot 0.25 \cdot 0.75 \cdot 0.0144 \cdot -0.20 = -0.00108\)

Step 4: Add the terms:
\[
\sigma_p^2 = 0.0004 + 0.018225 - 0.00108 = 0.017545
\]

Step 5: Take the square root to find \(\sigma_p\):
\[
\sigma_p = \sqrt{0.017545} \approx 0.1324 = 13.24\%
\]

The closest answer is b) 13.20%.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the classification of the investment**: The debt investment is classified as ""available-for-sale."" Unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities are not included in net income but are reported in other comprehensive income (OCI).

2. **Determine the tax effect**: The unrealized gain is $100,000, and the corporate tax rate is 25%. The tax effect on the unrealized gain is $100,000 × 25% = $25,000.

3. **Calculate the amounts for net income and OCI**:
   - Since unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities are not included in net income, the amount included in net income is $0.
   - The after-tax unrealized gain is $100,000 - $25,000 = $75,000, which is reported in OCI.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will use the formula for the present value of a perpetuity with growth: PV = D / (r - g), where D is the next payout, r is the discount rate, and g is the growth rate.

1. The next payout (D) is $10, the discount rate (r) is 15% or 0.15, and the growth rate (g) is 5% or 0.05.
2. Substituting these values into the formula: PV = 10 / (0.15 - 0.05).
3. Simplify the denominator: 0.15 - 0.05 = 0.10. So, PV = 10 / 0.10 = $100.

The value of the investment is $100. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: Negative assurance on whether unaudited condensed financial information complies in form with the accounting requirements of the SEC.  
   - Comfort letters often include negative assurance on unaudited financial information, particularly regarding compliance with SEC requirements. This is a standard inclusion in comfort letters.

2. **Option b**: An opinion on whether any fraud risk factors indicate significant incentive and opportunity relating to fraudulent financial reporting.  
   - Comfort letters do not typically address fraud risk factors or provide opinions on fraudulent financial reporting. This is outside the scope of a comfort letter.

3. **Option c**: Positive assurance on whether there has been any change in capital stock or long-term debt since the date of the audited financial statements.  
   - Comfort letters do not provide positive assurance on such matters. Instead, they may provide negative assurance or limited comments on changes in financial statement items.

4. **Option d**: An opinion on whether the entity's internal control components are operating as designed in achieving their stated objectives.  
   - Comfort letters do not include opinions on internal controls or their effectiveness. This is typically addressed in other types of reports, such as those related to SOX compliance.

After analyzing the options, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a)** Management displays a significant disregard for regulatory authorities.  
   - This characteristic indicates a potential ethical issue or lack of integrity within management, which could increase the risk of fraudulent financial reporting. Disregard for regulations often correlates with a higher likelihood of intentional misstatements.

2. **Option b)** There is a lack of turnover of employees in the accounting department.  
   - A lack of turnover in the accounting department does not inherently suggest a heightened risk of fraudulent financial reporting. In fact, stability in staffing could reduce the risk of errors or fraud.

3. **Option c)** Monthly bank reconciliations usually include several deposits in transit.  
   - Deposits in transit are common in bank reconciliations and do not necessarily indicate a heightened risk of fraudulent financial reporting. This is a normal part of the reconciliation process.

4. **Option d)** Equipment is usually sold at a loss before being fully depreciated.  
   - Selling equipment at a loss before full depreciation could indicate poor asset management but does not directly suggest fraudulent financial reporting.

Based on the analysis, the characteristic most likely to heighten an auditor's concern is **option a)** because it directly relates to management's integrity and ethical behavior, which are critical factors in assessing the risk of fraud.

The correct answer is: {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. The statement of activities for a not-for-profit organization is a financial report that shows the revenues, expenses, and changes in net assets during a specific period. Its purpose is to provide transparency and accountability regarding the organization's financial performance.

2. The primary audience for this statement is those who provide resources to the organization, such as donors, grantors, and other stakeholders. These resource providers need to understand how their contributions are being used and whether the organization is fulfilling its mission effectively.

3. While managers, beneficiaries, and state regulatory bodies may also use the statement of activities, the primary purpose is to inform resource providers.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate the accounts receivable balance using the formula for the average collection period:

1. First, I calculate the credit sales. Since cash sales were $25 million, the credit sales are $265 million - $25 million = $240 million.
2. Next, I calculate the daily credit sales. This is done by dividing the total credit sales by 365 days: $240 million ÷ 365 = approximately $0.6575 million per day.
3. Finally, I calculate the accounts receivable balance by multiplying the daily credit sales by the average collection period: $0.6575 million/day × 36 days = approximately $23.7 million.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine Palmyra Co.'s comprehensive income, I need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the net income, which is $11,000.
2. Add or subtract other comprehensive income (OCI) items:
   - Add the $1,000 net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
   - Subtract the $3,000 unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities.
   - Add the $2,000 foreign currency translation adjustment.
3. The increase in common stock is not part of comprehensive income, so it is excluded.

Now, calculate the comprehensive income:
$11,000 (net income) + $1,000 (change in accounting principle) - $3,000 (unrealized loss) + $2,000 (foreign currency adjustment) = $11,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to determine the amount of the $90,000 payment that relates to services performed in year 1. The services are performed evenly over six months, so the monthly expense is $90,000 ÷ 6 = $15,000. For November and December (2 months), the total expense for year 1 is $15,000 × 2 = $30,000.

Next, I need to calculate the amount of the payment that relates to services performed in year 2. Since the total payment is $90,000 and $30,000 relates to year 1, the remaining $90,000 - $30,000 = $60,000 relates to year 2.

The company initially expensed the entire $90,000 in October, year 1. To correct this, the company needs to adjust by removing the $60,000 that relates to year 2 from the services expense account and recording it as a prepaid asset.

Therefore, the adjusting journal entry is to debit prepaid services (an asset) and credit services expense for $60,000.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the key requirement of an agreed-upon procedures engagement. In such engagements, the practitioner performs specific procedures agreed upon by the parties involved and reports the factual findings without providing an opinion or assurance.

Next, I need to evaluate the choices. Option a) aligns with the purpose of an agreed-upon procedures engagement, as the practitioner issues a report on findings based on the procedures performed. Option b) involves assessing the needs of the parties, which is not the practitioner's responsibility. Option c) refers to expressing negative assurance, which is not applicable in agreed-upon procedures engagements. Option d) involves reporting differences between agreed-upon and audit procedures, which is not a standard requirement.

Finally, based on the analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The statement of financial position for a nongovernmental not-for-profit organization reports the organization's financial position at a specific point in time. It includes assets, liabilities, and net assets.
2. Net assets are classified into three categories: unrestricted net assets, temporarily restricted net assets, and permanently restricted net assets. These classifications are based on donor-imposed restrictions.
3. The total net assets section does not include total current assets or total other assets, as these are part of the assets section, not the net assets section.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To calculate the Bond Equivalent Yield (BEY), we use the formula:

\[
BEY = \left( \frac{\text{Face Value} - \text{Purchase Price}}{\text{Purchase Price}} \right) \times \frac{365}{\text{Days to Maturity}}
\]

Step 1: Calculate the difference between the face value and the purchase price.
\[
\text{Face Value} - \text{Purchase Price} = 1000 - 960 = 40
\]

Step 2: Divide the difference by the purchase price to find the yield.
\[
\frac{40}{960} = 0.04167
\]

Step 3: Adjust for the annualized yield using the BEY formula.
\[
BEY = 0.04167 \times \frac{365}{91} \approx 0.04167 \times 4.01099 \approx 0.1672 \text{ or } 16.7\%

"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. Joe is the trustee of a trust set up for his father. As the trustee, Joe has fiduciary responsibilities, including managing the trust and ensuring compliance with tax laws, such as filing Form 1041, the annual trust tax return.

2. According to the Internal Revenue Code, a tax return preparer is generally defined as someone who prepares tax returns for compensation. However, trustees who prepare tax returns for the trust they manage are not considered tax return preparers under this definition because they are acting in their fiduciary capacity, not as paid preparers.

3. Therefore, Joe, as the trustee, is not considered a tax return preparer when preparing and signing Form 1041 for the trust.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the amount of stock investments to be reported in the year-end statement of financial position, we need to calculate the fair value of the stocks at the end of the year.

1. For Stock A:
   - The fair value at the end of the year is $51 per share.
   - Total fair value = 100 shares × $51 = $5,100.

2. For Stock B:
   - The fair value at the end of the year is $49 per share.
   - Total fair value = 200 shares × $49 = $9,800.

3. Add the fair values of Stock A and Stock B:
   - Total fair value = $5,100 + $9,800 = $14,900.

The amount of stock investments to be reported is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Understand the relationship between Strut Co. and Plane Co.**: Strut Co. is a subsidiary of Plane Co., and Plane Co. consolidates Strut Co.'s financials into its consolidated balance sheet.

2. **Strut's balance sheet**: Strut Co. is a separate legal entity, so it will report the payable to its parent, Plane Co., as a liability on its own balance sheet.

3. **Plane's consolidated balance sheet**: In a consolidated balance sheet, intercompany transactions (like payables and receivables between Strut and Plane) are eliminated to avoid double counting. Therefore, the payable from Strut to Plane will not be reported separately in the consolidated balance sheet.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Notes to the financial statements**: The notes to the financial statements are used to provide additional information about the financial statements, including the basis of accounting used. If the entity uses a basis other than GAAP, such as the income tax basis, the notes should describe how this basis differs from GAAP.

2. **Auditor’s engagement letter**: The engagement letter outlines the scope of the audit and the responsibilities of both the auditor and the client. It does not typically include a description of the accounting basis used.

3. **Management representation letter**: This letter is provided by management to confirm certain representations made during the audit. It does not include a description of the accounting basis used.

4. **Introductory paragraph of the auditor’s report**: The introductory paragraph of the auditor’s report identifies the financial statements being audited and the basis of accounting used. However, it does not provide a detailed description of how the basis differs from GAAP.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to determine how many workdays are included in the $10,000 payroll. Since the payroll covers 10 workdays, the daily salary expense is $10,000 ÷ 10 = $1,000 per workday.

Next, I need to calculate the number of workdays from June 19 to June 30. The last payroll was paid on June 18, which covered the workdays up to that date. From June 19 to June 30, the workdays are June 21–25 (5 days) and June 28–30 (3 days), for a total of 8 workdays.

Now, I calculate the accrued salaries expense for these 8 workdays: 8 workdays × $1,000 per workday = $8,000.

Finally, I add the accrued salaries expense to the existing balance in the salaries expense account before accruals. The balance before accruals is $14,000, so the total salaries expense for June is $14,000 + $8,000 = $22,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze the nature of changes in accounting estimates. Changes in accounting estimates are adjustments of the carrying amount of an asset or liability or the amount of the periodic consumption of an asset, resulting from new information or new developments.

Next, I need to consider how changes in accounting estimates are accounted for. These changes are typically accounted for prospectively, meaning they affect the current and future periods only, not past periods.

Now, I need to evaluate the choices:
a) This is incorrect because most changes in accounting estimates are accounted for prospectively, not retrospectively.
b) This is incorrect because when it is impossible to determine whether a change is an estimate or a principle, it should be treated as a change in estimate, not principle.
c) This is correct because when it is unclear whether the change is an estimate or principle, it is treated as a change in estimate.
d) This is incorrect because it is generally easier to differentiate between a change in estimate and a principle than between a change in estimate and an error.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the rights and responsibilities of a partner in a general partnership. Partners in a general partnership typically have the right to participate in management, review accounting records, and enter into contracts on behalf of the partnership, though this may require consent depending on the partnership agreement.

Next, I consider the liability aspect. In a general partnership, partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership, not just for their personal negligence. This means they can be held liable for the actions of other partners as well.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the choices step by step:

1. **Engagement letters** are agreements between the auditor and the client that outline the terms of the audit engagement. They typically include details about the scope of the audit, responsibilities of both parties, and administrative arrangements.

2. **Choice a**: ""Arrangements regarding fees and billing"" is a common inclusion in engagement letters, as it clarifies the financial terms of the engagement.

3. **Choice b**: ""Analytical procedures that the auditor plans to perform"" is not typically included in the engagement letter. This is part of the audit planning process, not the engagement agreement.

4. **Choice c**: ""Indications of negative cash flows from operating activities"" is a finding that might arise during the audit, not something included in the engagement letter.

5. **Choice d**: ""Identification of working capital deficiencies"" is also a potential audit finding, not a matter included in the engagement letter.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. Pension plans and trusts are required to provide financial statements that reflect the value of their investments accurately. This ensures transparency and consistency in reporting.
2. According to accounting standards (e.g., U.S. GAAP or IFRS), plan investments are generally reported at their fair value. Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
3. Historical cost, net realizable value, and lower of historical cost or market are not the appropriate bases for reporting plan investments in pension plans and trusts.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the standard compilation report issued by an accountant for a nonissuer. This report states that the accountant has not audited or reviewed the financial statements, which is a key implication of the report.

Next, I need to evaluate the choices. Option a) aligns with the standard compilation report because it implies that the accountant has not audited or reviewed the financial statements. Option b) is incorrect because the report does not guarantee that all GAAP disclosures are included. Option c) is incorrect because the report does not restrict the use of financial statements for obtaining credit. Option d) is true but is explicitly stated in the report, not just implied.

Finally, the correct answer is the one that is implied but not explicitly stated, which is option a). Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To solve this, I will use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) formula:  
Required Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate).

Step 1: Calculate the required return for Plaid Pants' common stock.  
- Beta = 0.90  
- Risk-Free Rate = 6%  
- Market Return = 10%  
- Required Return = 6% + 0.90 * (10% - 6%) = 6% + 0.90 * 4% = 6% + 3.6% = 9.6%.

Step 2: Calculate the required return for Acme's common stock.  
- Beta = 1.80  
- Risk-Free Rate = 6%  
- Market Return = 10%  
- Required Return = 6% + 1.80 * (10% - 6%) = 6% + 1.80 * 4% = 6% + 7.2% = 13.2%.

Step 3: Match the calculated values to the choices.  
The required return for Plaid Pants' common stock is 9.6%, and for Acme's common stock is 13.2%. The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the amount the company paid for the new machine, we need to calculate the annual cash inflow and use the payback period formula.

1. **Calculate the annual cash inflow**:  
   The annual cash inflow is the revenue minus the cash operating expenses (excluding depreciation, as it is a non-cash expense).  
   Annual cash inflow = $35,000 - ($7,000 - $4,000) = $35,000 - $3,000 = $32,000.

2. **Use the payback period formula**:  
   The payback period is the time it takes for the initial investment to be recovered through annual cash inflows.  
   Payback period = Initial investment ÷ Annual cash inflow.  
   Rearranging to find the initial investment:  
   Initial investment = Payback period × Annual cash inflow = 5.2 × $32,000 = $166,400.

3. **Verify the calculation**:  
   The calculated initial investment aligns with the payback period and annual cash inflow.

"First, I need to understand intraperiod income tax allocation. It is the process of allocating income tax expense or benefit to different components of income, such as continuing operations, discontinued operations, and extraordinary items.

Next, I analyze the options:
a) Discontinued operations: Intraperiod tax allocation applies to this because taxes must be allocated to the income or loss from discontinued operations.
b) Income from continuing operations: Intraperiod tax allocation applies here as well because taxes are allocated to continuing operations.
c) Extraordinary gains and losses: Intraperiod tax allocation applies to extraordinary items since taxes must be allocated to these unusual and infrequent events.
d) Operating income: This is a subtotal within income from continuing operations and does not require separate intraperiod tax allocation.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, I will calculate the net present value (NPV) of the machine using the given data.

1. First, calculate the present value of the cash inflows. The machine produces uniform cash inflows of $25,000 for 4 years. Using the present value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10% (3.170), the total present value of cash inflows is:
   $25,000 × 3.170 = $79,250.

2. Next, subtract the cost of the machine ($80,000) from the total present value of cash inflows to determine the NPV:
   NPV = $79,250 - $80,000 = -$750.

3. Since the NPV is negative (-$750), Skytop should not acquire the machine.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine Skinner's basis in the partnership interest, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the initial contribution basis**: Skinner contributed $5,000 in cash and land with a $12,000 basis. The initial contribution basis is $5,000 + $12,000 = $17,000.

2. **Adjust for the mortgage assumed by the partnership**: The land was subject to a $10,000 mortgage, which the partnership assumed. This reduces Skinner's basis by $10,000. So, $17,000 - $10,000 = $7,000.

3. **Add Skinner's share of partnership liabilities**: The partnership has $20,000 in recourse liabilities, and Skinner's share is 20% (based on his partnership interest). Thus, Skinner's share of the liabilities is 20% × $20,000 = $4,000. Adding this to the adjusted basis: $7,000 + $4,000 = $11,000.

4. **Add back the mortgage liability allocated to Skinner**: When the partnership assumes the $10,000 mortgage, Skinner is still allocated 20% of this liability as part of his share of partnership liabilities. Thus, 20% × $10,000 = $2,000. Adding this to the basis: $11,000 + $2,000 = $13,000.

Therefore, Skinner's basis in the partnership interest is **$13,000**.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to calculate the estimated returns for the new sales made during the month. The company estimates that 5% of sales will be returned, so the estimated returns are 5% of $200,000, which is $200,000 * 0.05 = $10,000.

Next, I subtract the estimated returns from the total sales for the month to determine the net sales revenue. The net sales revenue is $200,000 - $10,000 = $190,000.

The returns of $5,000 from prior months do not affect the calculation of net sales revenue for the new sales made during the month.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the amount of consigned inventory to be included in Stone Co.'s December 31, Year 1 balance sheet, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Inventory shipped on consignment to Omega Co.**: The $36,000 worth of inventory shipped to Omega Co. remains the property of Stone Co. because it is on consignment. Therefore, this amount should be included in Stone's inventory.

2. **Freight paid by Stone ($1,800)**: Freight costs paid by Stone to ship the consigned inventory to Omega Co. are considered part of the cost of the consigned inventory. Thus, this $1,800 should also be included in the inventory value.

3. **Inventory received on consignment from Gamma Co.**: The $24,000 worth of inventory received from Gamma Co. is not owned by Stone Co. because it is consigned to them. Therefore, this amount should not be included in Stone's inventory.

4. **Freight paid by Gamma ($1,000)**: Since the inventory received from Gamma Co. is not owned by Stone Co., the freight paid by Gamma is irrelevant to Stone's inventory.

Now, summing up the relevant amounts:
- Inventory shipped to Omega Co.: $36,000
- Freight paid by Stone: $1,800
- Total consigned inventory to be included: $36,000 + $1,800 = $37,800.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the scenario**: Dawn Corp. has unfavorable labor rate and labor efficiency variances. Writing these variances off directly to cost of goods sold increases the cost of goods sold, which reduces net income. If instead, the variances were allocated to work in process, finished goods, and cost of goods sold, the impact on cost of goods sold would be smaller, as the variances would be spread across multiple accounts.

2. **Effect on current ratio**: Allocating the variances to work in process and finished goods increases the inventory balances (current assets). Since the current ratio is current assets divided by current liabilities, an increase in current assets would increase the current ratio.

3. **Effect on net income**: Allocating the variances reduces the amount charged directly to cost of goods sold, which means net income would increase compared to writing the variances off directly.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the IFAC Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, which emphasizes professional competence and due care. This means the accountant must only undertake tasks they are competent to perform or can become competent in through proper research and preparation.

Next, the accountant has no prior experience with weather hedges but has experience with financial hedges. This suggests that with sufficient research and understanding, the accountant could potentially provide a recommendation while maintaining professional competence.

Finally, refusing to conduct research or simply agreeing with the company's hedge fund trader without proper evaluation would not align with the principles of professional competence and due care. Therefore, the appropriate action is to agree to recommend the accounting treatment after performing sufficient research.

"To determine which group of corporations qualifies as an affiliated group and may file a consolidated federal income tax return, I need to analyze the ownership structure and the rules for forming an affiliated group.

1. An affiliated group requires a parent corporation to own at least 80% of the voting power and value of at least one subsidiary, and the subsidiaries must meet the same 80% ownership threshold either directly or indirectly.
2. Rigg owns 85% of Steele, which satisfies the 80% ownership requirement for Steele to be part of an affiliated group with Rigg.
3. Rigg owns only 40% of Urco, which does not meet the 80% ownership threshold. Steele owns 50% of Urco, but even combined, Rigg and Steele do not meet the 80% threshold for Urco.

Thus, the affiliated group consists only of Rigg and Steele, and Urco cannot be included in the group.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Option a: Obtain a letter of representation from the former client's management.**
   - When reissuing an auditor's report, the CPA should ensure that the information in the financial statements is still valid and accurate. A letter of representation from management provides assurance that there have been no material changes or events that would affect the prior period's financial statements. This is a standard procedure when reissuing an auditor's report.

2. **Option b: Make inquiries of the former client's attorney regarding pending litigation.**
   - This step is typically performed during the original audit to assess the impact of litigation on the financial statements. However, when reissuing a report, the CPA is not required to perform new audit procedures unless there is a reason to believe that the prior period's financial statements are no longer accurate.

3. **Option c: Review the former client's records to verify its compliance with debt and loan agreements.**
   - Similar to option b, this step is part of the original audit process. When reissuing a report, the CPA does not need to perform new audit procedures unless there is evidence of material changes affecting the prior period's financial statements.

4. **Option d: Consider whether there is substantial doubt about the former client's ability to continue as a going concern.**
   - The going concern assessment is part of the original audit process. When reissuing a report, the CPA is not required to reassess the going concern status unless there is new information that would affect the prior period's financial statements.

The most appropriate step before reissuing the auditor's report is to obtain a letter of representation from the former client's management to confirm that the prior period's financial statements are still accurate and that no material changes have occurred.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options step by step:

1. **Governmental fund financial statements**: These focus on current financial resources and use the modified accrual basis of accounting. They do not include a statement of cash flows because they do not track cash flows in the same way as proprietary funds.

2. **Government-wide financial statements**: These provide a broad overview of the government's finances and use the accrual basis of accounting. However, they do not include a statement of cash flows, as this is not a required component of government-wide financial reporting.

3. **Proprietary fund financial statements**: These funds operate similarly to private businesses and use the accrual basis of accounting. A statement of cash flows is required for proprietary funds because it provides important information about cash inflows and outflows related to operating, investing, and financing activities.

4. **Fiduciary fund financial statements**: These funds account for resources held for others and use the accrual basis of accounting. However, they do not require a statement of cash flows because their focus is on net position and changes in net position, not cash flows.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine inelastic demand, we need to calculate the price elasticity of demand (PED), which is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. If the absolute value of PED is less than 1, the demand is inelastic.

Step 1: For option a), the PED is |(-3%) / (5%)| = 0.6, which is less than 1, indicating inelastic demand.

Step 2: For option b), the PED is |(-6%) / (4%)| = 1.5, which is greater than 1, indicating elastic demand.

Step 3: For option c), the PED is |(-4%) / (4%)| = 1, which is unitary elastic demand.

Step 4: For option d), the PED is |(5%) / (-3%)| = 1.67, which is greater than 1, indicating elastic demand.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze step by step:

1. Legal fees incurred to defend a patent are considered costs that can be capitalized if they enhance the value of the patent or extend its useful life. This is typically the case when the litigation is successful.
2. If the litigation is unsuccessful, the legal fees do not enhance the value of the patent, and therefore, they should be expensed rather than capitalized.
3. Based on this reasoning, legal fees should be capitalized only when the litigation is successful, not when it is unsuccessful.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
