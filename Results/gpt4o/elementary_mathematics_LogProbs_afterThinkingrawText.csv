2. Without knowing the total number of students in each class, we cannot determine whether the 0.5 of Mr. Paulson’s class is greater than, less than, or equal to the 0.5 of Ms. Hugo’s class in terms of the actual number of students.

3. Therefore, the missing information needed to make the comparison is the total number of students in each teacher’s class.

Next, I multiply 72 (the total number of students) by 4/9: \( 72 \times \frac{4}{9} = 32 \).  
Finally, I confirm that 32 is the correct number of students taking tap lessons.  

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to calculate the proportion of voters in the survey who would vote for candidate A. This is 450 out of 1000, or 450 ÷ 1000 = 0.45.

Next, I need to use this proportion to predict the number of votes candidate A would receive if 220,000 people vote. I multiply the proportion (0.45) by the total number of voters (220,000): 0.45 × 220,000 = 99,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to arrange the data set in ascending order: 8, 10, 10, 13, 22, 24, 26, 32, 35.  
Next, I need to find the middle value since the median is the middle number in an ordered data set.  
The data set has 9 numbers, so the middle value is the 5th number.  
The 5th number in the ordered set is 22.  
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, Peter needs to determine how many groups of 5 people can fit into the total group of 25 people.  
Next, dividing the total number of people (25) by the number of people per boat (5) will give the number of boats needed.  
Finally, 25 ÷ 5 = 5 boats. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
