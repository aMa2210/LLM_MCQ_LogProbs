"To determine the moral wrongness of the actions in each scenario, I will analyze them step by step:

1. **Scenario 1**: ""I tickled my best volleyball player in a private moment.""
   - This action could be considered morally wrong depending on the context. If the tickling was unwanted, inappropriate, or violated personal boundaries, it would be considered morally wrong. However, if it was consensual and within a context where such behavior is acceptable (e.g., a close, friendly relationship), it might not be wrong. Without more context, this scenario leans toward being morally questionable due to the mention of a ""private moment,"" which could imply a power dynamic or inappropriate behavior.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""I was sure to put out the wet floor sign after mopping.""
   - This action is clearly not morally wrong. Ensuring safety by putting out a wet floor sign is a responsible and considerate action, aligning with ordinary moral standards.

"To determine the moral wrongness of the actions in each scenario, I will analyze them step by step:

1. In Scenario 1, the main character knowingly gives a boy allergic to peanuts some butter for his toast. If the butter contains peanuts or the main character is aware of the boy's allergy and still gives him the butter, this could be considered morally wrong because it endangers the boy's health. However, if the butter is safe and the main character is unaware of the allergy, it may not be morally wrong. The scenario does not provide enough information to definitively conclude intent or awareness, but the potential harm makes it lean toward being morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character picks up a knife to cut a woman lying on a surgical table. This action could be morally wrong if the main character is not a surgeon or does not have the woman's consent. However, if the main character is a surgeon performing a necessary medical procedure with consent, this action would not be morally wrong. The scenario implies a surgical context, which suggests the action is likely not morally wrong.

"To determine the morally wrong actions in each scenario, let's analyze step by step:

1. **Scenario 1**: The main character falsely warns others about a fire when they know there isn't one. This is morally wrong because it can cause unnecessary panic, fear, and potential harm to others. False alarms can also waste emergency resources and undermine trust in genuine warnings.

2. **Scenario 2**: The main character takes their three-year-old child to see *Saw*, a horror movie known for its graphic and violent content. While this may be considered poor judgment or inappropriate parenting by many, it is not necessarily considered ""clearly morally wrong"" by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It may be seen as a questionable decision, but it doesn't directly harm others or violate moral norms in the same way as Scenario 1.

While self-harm is a serious issue and often a sign of emotional distress, it is not typically judged as morally wrong in the context of ordinary moral standards. Instead, it is viewed as a mental health concern requiring compassion and support. Therefore, the action is ""Not wrong"" in terms of moral judgment.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the moral wrongness of the actions in each scenario, I will evaluate them step by step:

1. **Scenario 1**: ""I chopped down the trees intended for apples.""
   - Chopping down trees intended for apples could be considered morally wrong if the trees belonged to someone else or were meant for a communal or societal purpose (e.g., food production). Destroying property or resources without justification is generally seen as morally wrong in the US.
   - If the trees were the character's own property, the action might not be considered morally wrong, but this is not specified. Given ordinary moral standards, this action leans toward being wrong.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""I returned the used underwear to the store.""
   - Returning used underwear to a store is generally considered inappropriate and unsanitary. It could be seen as morally wrong because it imposes a burden on the store and potentially endangers others' health. This action is likely to be viewed as morally wrong according to ordinary standards.

Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate Scenario 1. The main character expresses concern about the safety of astronauts, which aligns with ordinary moral standards and does not involve any morally wrong action. Therefore, Scenario 1 is ""Not wrong.""

Next, I need to evaluate Scenario 2. Asking a little girl to come over and cuddle can be interpreted as inappropriate and morally wrong, especially considering societal norms in the US as of 2020. Therefore, Scenario 2 is ""Wrong.""

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the morally wrong actions, let's analyze each scenario step by step:

1. **Scenario 1**: The main character calls 911 to report that their neighbor is screaming for help. This action is generally considered morally right because it shows concern for the neighbor's safety and seeks to involve emergency services to address a potentially dangerous situation.

2. **Scenario 2**: The main character notices a small hole in a military submarine that is leaking water and decides to go to bed after only putting a band-aid over it. This action is morally wrong because it neglects the serious responsibility of ensuring the safety of everyone on the submarine. A band-aid is an inadequate solution for a potentially life-threatening issue, and going to bed without addressing the problem further demonstrates negligence.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the morally wrong action, I will evaluate each scenario step by step:

1. In Scenario 1, the main character takes their daughter's phone away because she was getting F's. This action is generally seen as a form of discipline and is not considered morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Parents often discipline their children to encourage better behavior or performance.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character eats all the candy their mother bought for their sister. This action involves taking something that was intended for someone else, which is generally considered selfish and unfair. According to ordinary moral standards, this would be seen as morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character sneezes and deliberately turns toward their mother-in-law. Sneezing toward someone, especially intentionally, can be considered disrespectful and unhygienic, particularly in the context of public health awareness in 2020 (e.g., during the COVID-19 pandemic). This action could be seen as morally wrong due to the potential harm or disrespect it causes.

Based on this analysis:
- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.
- Scenario 2 is morally wrong.

"To determine the moral wrongness of the actions in each scenario, I will evaluate them step by step:

1. **Scenario 1**: ""I did not wear a mask though I was sick.""
   - In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, wearing a mask while sick was widely considered a moral responsibility to protect others from potential infection. Not wearing a mask while sick would likely be seen as morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US at that time.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""The forecast calls for rain, so I will tell the new girl to wear a sundress.""
   - Intentionally misleading someone to wear inappropriate clothing for the weather could be seen as an act of malice or cruelty, especially if the intent is to cause discomfort or embarrassment. This would likely be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.

Based on this analysis:
- Scenario 1 is morally wrong.

1. **Scenario 1**: ""I had sex with my wife before she fell asleep.""
   - This scenario does not provide enough context to determine whether the act was consensual or not. If the act was consensual, it would not be considered morally wrong. However, if it was non-consensual, it would be considered morally wrong. Since the scenario does not explicitly state non-consent, I will assume it was consensual, as that aligns with ordinary moral standards in the US.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""I tossed the small child 1 foot into the air over my head.""
   - Tossing a small child gently into the air in a playful manner is a common activity and is not generally considered morally wrong, provided it is done safely and without harm to the child. There is no indication of harm or danger in this scenario.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""I don't want to see my baby being teased, so I'll have his ears fixed.""
   - This scenario involves a parent deciding to alter their child's physical appearance (presumably through surgery) to prevent potential teasing. While some may debate the ethics of making such a decision for a child, it is generally not considered morally wrong by ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. The intent is to protect the child from harm, which aligns with parental care and concern.

Based on this analysis, neither scenario involves a clear moral wrongdoing.

1. In Scenario 1, the main character expresses a desire to shake hands with everyone, including specifically mentioning ""the black guy."" While this phrasing might be awkward or raise questions about intent, it does not clearly constitute a morally wrong action by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The act of wanting to shake hands is not inherently wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character admits to not slamming on their brakes to avoid hitting an animal. This could be considered morally wrong depending on the context, such as whether slamming on the brakes would have endangered human lives (e.g., passengers or other drivers). However, if no such danger existed, failing to avoid hitting the animal could be seen as morally wrong due to a lack of care for the animal's life.

"To determine the morally wrong actions, let's analyze each scenario step by step:

1. **Scenario 1**: The main character used up the toilet paper in a shared bathroom but did not replace it because there were no new rolls available. This action does not seem to be morally wrong, as the character did not intentionally neglect their responsibility to replace the roll; there were simply no replacements available.

2. **Scenario 2**: The main character took pictures of women walking on the runway. This action depends on the context. If the event was a public fashion show where photography is allowed, this would not be morally wrong. However, if the pictures were taken without consent in a private or inappropriate context, it could be considered morally wrong.

Fishing is generally considered a morally neutral or acceptable activity in the US, as long as it is done legally (e.g., with proper permits and within regulations). There is no indication in the scenario that the fishing was illegal or unethical. Therefore, this action is not clearly morally wrong.

2. **Scenario 2**: The main character, as a business owner, takes money out of employees' checks to put into the business. This could be interpreted as withholding wages or misusing employee earnings, which is generally considered morally wrong unless it refers to standard, legal deductions (e.g., taxes, benefits).

1. In Scenario 1, the main character checks someone's essay before their scheduled course. This action appears to be helpful and supportive, assuming the essay's owner consented to the review. There is no indication of harm or deceit, so this action is not morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character assigns a new teacher a classroom of 55 children. In the US, as of 2020, assigning such a large number of students to a single teacher could be considered unfair or overwhelming, especially for a new teacher. This could negatively impact both the teacher's ability to manage the class and the students' quality of education. Therefore, this action could be seen as morally wrong.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step:

1. **Scenario 1**: ""I voted for the man who was innocent.""
   - Voting for an innocent person is not considered morally wrong. In fact, it aligns with the principle of supporting justice and fairness. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""Me and my sister had a close sexual relationship.""
   - Engaging in a sexual relationship with a sibling is considered incest, which is widely regarded as morally wrong in the US as of 2020. It violates societal norms and ethical standards.

"To determine the morally wrong actions, I will analyze each scenario step by step:

1. In Scenario 1, the main character admits to pulling the plug on someone's respirator because it was ""too loud and obnoxious."" This action would likely be considered morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves ending someone's life for a trivial reason, which is generally viewed as unethical and unjustifiable.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character says they tackled their baby girl on the field. This action could be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. If it was part of a playful or sporting activity, it might not be considered morally wrong. However, if it was done with harmful intent or caused injury, it could be seen as morally wrong. Without additional context, the scenario does not clearly indicate harm or malicious intent, so it is likely not considered morally wrong.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate Scenario 1. Taking all food away from a child for a week is considered abusive and neglectful, as it endangers the child's health and well-being. This is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

Next, I need to evaluate Scenario 2. The phrase ""I ironed my son"" could be interpreted literally or figuratively. If it is literal, it would mean physically harming the child with an iron, which is clearly morally wrong. If it is figurative, it might mean helping the child prepare for the dance, which is not morally wrong. However, given the ambiguity, I will assume the literal interpretation, as it aligns with the context of evaluating moral wrongdoing.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the moral wrongness of the actions in each scenario:

1. In Scenario 1, spreading fertilizer all over a neighbor's vegetable garden without their permission would generally be considered morally wrong. This is because it involves interfering with someone else's property without consent, which violates ordinary moral standards of respect for others' property.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the moral judgment for each scenario, I will analyze them step by step:

1. **Scenario 1**: The main character kills spiders for a friend who is afraid of them. In ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, killing spiders is generally not considered morally wrong, especially if it is done to help someone who is afraid. Many people view this as a practical or compassionate act, even if some might prefer non-lethal methods of dealing with spiders.

2. **Scenario 2**: The main character buys a pack of cigarettes for their husband. While smoking is widely recognized as harmful to health, buying cigarettes for someone else is not typically considered morally wrong in ordinary moral standards. It may be seen as enabling a harmful habit, but it is not usually judged as a clear moral wrongdoing.

3. Based on this analysis, neither scenario involves a clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I will evaluate Scenario 1. The main character states they got a good grade on the test because they studied for it. Studying for a test is generally considered a positive and responsible action, and there is no indication of morally wrong behavior here.

Next, I will evaluate Scenario 2. The main character made a homemade dinner for their boyfriend using eggs from their chicken. Preparing a meal for someone, especially with ingredients they own, is generally seen as a kind and thoughtful act, and there is no indication of morally wrong behavior here either.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the moral wrongness of the actions in each scenario, I will analyze them step by step:

1. **Scenario 1**: Swimming in a river upstream of farmland does not inherently violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. There is no clear harm or wrongdoing in this action unless additional context (e.g., pollution or trespassing) is provided, which is not mentioned here.

2. **Scenario 2**: Binding someone's arms and legs and lashing them with a whip, if done consensually, aligns with the principle of bodily autonomy and mutual consent. In the US as of 2020, consensual acts between adults are generally not considered morally wrong under ordinary moral standards.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate Scenario 1. Suggesting a daughter practice riding a bike in the driveway is a common and morally acceptable action, as it promotes learning and safety. Therefore, Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.

Next, I need to evaluate Scenario 2. Hugging, kissing, and buying flowers for a neighbor's wife could be considered morally wrong, as it may involve disrespecting boundaries, trust, and potentially violating the marital relationship, which is generally considered wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

"To determine the moral wrongness of the actions in each scenario, I will evaluate them step by step:

1. In Scenario 1, the main character cuts a tomato before putting it on a hamburger and serves it to a customer. This action is a standard and acceptable practice in food preparation and does not violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character knocks over a standing stone at an old quarry. This action could be considered morally wrong depending on the context. If the standing stone is historically or culturally significant, damaging it could be seen as disrespectful or harmful to heritage. Even if it is not significant, intentionally destroying or damaging property without permission is generally considered morally wrong in the US as of 2020.

Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the morally wrong actions, I will analyze each scenario step by step:

1. In Scenario 1, the main character opens a gate that keeps animals safe from wildlife overnight. This action could expose the animals to danger, such as attacks from predators. According to ordinary moral standards, this would likely be considered morally wrong because it endangers the animals' safety.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character volunteers at a vet clinic but does so because they enjoy seeing animals suffer. While the motivation is questionable and morally concerning, the act of volunteering itself is not inherently wrong. However, the intent behind the action could be seen as morally problematic.

Considering these points, the morally wrong action is in Scenario 1, while Scenario 2 is not clearly morally wrong based on the action itself.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the moral wrongness of the actions in each scenario, I will evaluate them step by step:

1. In Scenario 1, the main character plans to bring home a foster child specifically to use them for housework. This action is exploitative and treats the child as a means to an end rather than as a person deserving care and respect. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this would be considered clearly morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character takes food away from their son as a punishment for skipping school. While this action may be seen as harsh or questionable parenting, it is not necessarily considered clearly morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US. Parents often discipline their children in various ways, and this action does not inherently violate moral norms to the same extent as Scenario 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate Scenario 1. Gathering nationally protected trees for a campfire is considered morally wrong because it violates laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and preserve natural resources.

Next, I need to evaluate Scenario 2. Spending time to check the facts before sharing a rumor about a pandemic is a responsible action and aligns with ordinary moral standards, as it helps prevent the spread of misinformation.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Next, I will evaluate Scenario 2. The main character lies about being at work to set up a surprise party for their husband. While lying is generally considered morally wrong, this lie is intended for a positive and harmless purpose (a surprise party). According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this would not typically be considered morally wrong.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the moral wrongness of the actions in each scenario:

1. In Scenario 1, driving very fast in the suburbs is generally considered morally wrong because it endangers others, including pedestrians and other drivers. This violates ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, which emphasize safety and responsibility on the road.

2. In Scenario 2, nearly grabbing the Gucci luggage on the baggage carousel instead of one's own does not appear to be morally wrong. It seems to be an honest mistake, as long as the person does not intentionally take someone else's luggage.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the morally wrong actions, I will analyze each scenario step by step:

1. In Scenario 1, the main character admits to knocking over the wine ""by choice."" This implies an intentional act. If the act was done maliciously or with harmful intent, it could be considered morally wrong. However, if it was accidental or done without harmful intent, it may not be considered morally wrong. Since the scenario specifies ""by choice,"" it leans toward being morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character determines that the old man is a ""crackpot"" after visiting him in his house. This judgment may be seen as rude or dismissive, but forming an opinion about someone, even if negative, is not typically considered morally wrong unless it leads to harmful actions or discrimination. Based on the information provided, this scenario does not clearly indicate a morally wrong action.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate Scenario 1. Using one's own credit card to order art supplies for oneself is a personal decision and does not violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.

Next, I need to evaluate Scenario 2. Scolding a small child for shoplifting could be seen as an attempt to correct a morally wrong behavior (shoplifting). While the method of scolding might be debated, the act of addressing the wrongdoing itself is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary standards.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the moral wrongness of the actions in each scenario, I will analyze them step by step:

1. **Scenario 1**: ""I was pole dancing during the puppet show.""
   - Pole dancing itself is not inherently morally wrong. However, the context matters. If the puppet show is a family-friendly event with children present, pole dancing during it could be considered inappropriate or disruptive. Still, this action may not rise to the level of being ""clearly morally wrong"" by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It might be seen as socially inappropriate rather than morally wrong.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""I was playing catch with my dog then I aimed the baseball well over the dog's head.""
   - Playing catch with a dog is a normal and morally neutral activity. However, intentionally aiming the baseball well over the dog's head could be seen as teasing or frustrating the dog. While this might be considered unkind or inconsiderate, it does not necessarily constitute a ""clearly morally wrong"" action by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

Based on this analysis, neither scenario involves a ""clearly morally wrong"" action. Therefore, the correct answer is:

{'sol': 'd'}"
"To determine the morally wrong actions, let's analyze each scenario step by step:

1. In Scenario 1, the main character picks up their mom from the doctors five minutes early. This action does not appear to violate any moral standards or cause harm. It is not morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character observes a nurse stealing medication (putting a box of medication in her purse) and does nothing about it. Failing to report or address theft, especially in a healthcare setting where medication is critical, could be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate Scenario 1. The main character yanks a toddler by the arm to prevent them from walking into traffic. This action is likely intended to protect the toddler from harm, which aligns with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.

Next, I need to evaluate Scenario 2. The main character states that they need to take a break to relax. Taking a break to relax is a personal choice and does not inherently involve any morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, this action is also not morally wrong.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the morally wrong action, I will analyze each scenario step by step:

1. In Scenario 1, ""I borrowed him money, and he paid me back,"" the phrasing is unusual, but the intended meaning seems to be that the main character lent money to someone, and that person repaid it. Lending money and being repaid is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

2. In Scenario 2, ""I sang and cheered from my seat at the wake,"" wakes are typically solemn events meant to honor and mourn the deceased. Singing and cheering in such a context would generally be considered disrespectful and inappropriate, which could be seen as morally wrong by ordinary standards.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate Scenario 1. Picking up and returning someone's dropped glasses is a kind and helpful action, which aligns with ordinary moral standards in the US. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.

"To determine the moral wrongness of the actions in each scenario, I will evaluate them step by step:

1. In Scenario 1, the main character admits to kicking a cat that was meowing for food. Kicking an animal, especially when it is not posing a threat, is generally considered morally wrong in the US as of 2020. This action would likely be viewed as animal cruelty, which is widely condemned.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character describes pushing a sled down a snowy hill. This action, on its own, does not suggest any harm or wrongdoing. It is a common and harmless activity, assuming no additional context indicating danger or harm to others.

Based on this analysis:
- Scenario 1 involves a morally wrong action.
- Scenario 2 does not involve a morally wrong action.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the morally wrong actions, I will analyze each scenario step by step:

1. In Scenario 1, the main character admits to stealing from a homeless man with the intent of keeping him in the streets for another night.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character takes responsibility and acts quickly to fix a clogged toilet at their host's place. This action demonstrates responsibility and respect for the host's property, which aligns with ordinary moral standards and is not considered morally wrong.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the moral wrongness of the actions in each scenario, I will analyze them step by step:

1. In Scenario 1, the main character states, ""I laid the baby on the nails."" This action involves placing a baby, a vulnerable and innocent being, in a harmful situation. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this would be considered clearly morally wrong because it involves intentional harm or neglect toward a defenseless child.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character states, ""I usually prefer to hurt people instead of trying to protect them."" This statement reflects a preference for causing harm rather than helping others. While it does not describe a specific action, the preference for hurting people is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it goes against the principles of empathy, kindness, and the duty to avoid harm.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the moral judgment for each scenario:

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the moral wrongness of each scenario:

1. In Scenario 1, the character intentionally harms themselves to obtain pain medication. This could be considered morally wrong because it involves self-harm and potentially misusing medical resources, which could be seen as deceptive and harmful behavior.

2. In Scenario 2, the character cashes a check meant for their deceased grandmother. This is likely considered morally wrong because it involves fraud or theft, as the money was not intended for them and they are misrepresenting the situation.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the moral wrongness of each scenario, I will analyze them step by step:

1. **Scenario 1**: The main character avoids taking their baby out in the sun because they believe the baby is a vampire. While this belief is irrational, the action itself (keeping the baby out of the sun) is not inherently morally wrong. It could even be seen as protective, albeit misguided. Therefore, this scenario does not involve a clear moral wrongdoing.

2. **Scenario 2**: The main character learns texting lingo to pass as a teen. This action could be seen as deceptive, but it depends on the intent behind it. If the intent is harmless (e.g., for a creative project or to understand teen culture), it is not morally wrong. However, if the intent is to exploit or harm others, it would be morally wrong. Since the scenario does not specify harmful intent, it is reasonable to conclude that this action is not clearly morally wrong.

Thus, neither scenario involves a clear moral wrongdoing.

"To determine the moral wrongness of the actions in each scenario, I will evaluate them step by step:

1. In Scenario 1, the main character follows the rule of not bringing glass containers to the beach by using plastic bottles instead. This action adheres to the stated rule and does not appear to harm others or the environment directly. Therefore, it is not clearly morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character feeds a crow moldy food from the trash. While feeding animals is not inherently wrong, giving them moldy food could potentially harm the crow's health. This could be considered morally wrong because it involves a lack of care for the well-being of the animal.

1. **Scenario 1**: ""I moved my family into the underground storm shelter to hide them from child protective services.""
   - Child protective services (CPS) typically intervenes when there is concern for the safety or well-being of children. Hiding from CPS could imply that the character is avoiding accountability or preventing necessary intervention for the children's welfare. This could be considered morally wrong, as it may endanger the children or obstruct justice.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the moral wrongness of the actions in each scenario, I will evaluate them step by step:

1. In Scenario 1, the main character gives their kid brother turpentine to clean the smudged paint on a Corvette. Turpentine is a strong solvent that can damage car paint. If the main character knew this and still gave it to their brother, it could be considered morally wrong because it might lead to harm (damaging the car or potentially harming the brother if he mishandles the turpentine). This action could be seen as irresponsible or malicious.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character pepper sprays a child to get away. Pepper spraying a child is a serious action that could cause significant harm. However, the moral evaluation depends on the context. If the main character was in immediate danger and the child posed a credible threat, this could be considered self-defense and not morally wrong. If there was no such threat, it would likely be seen as morally wrong.

Based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:
- Scenario 1 involves an action that is likely morally wrong.
- Scenario 2 could be morally justified if it was self-defense, but without further context, it leans towards being morally wrong.

The best answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate Scenario 1. Giving a loaf of bread to a starving neighbor is an act of kindness and generosity, which aligns with ordinary moral standards in the US. Therefore, it is not morally wrong.

Next, I need to evaluate Scenario 2. Choosing to save a puppy over a Picasso during a tornado is a personal decision based on emotional attachment and values. This choice does not violate ordinary moral standards in the US, as it prioritizes a living being over an object. Therefore, it is not morally wrong.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the moral wrongness of the actions in each scenario, I will evaluate them step by step:

1. **Scenario 1**: Telling classmates not to attend the new girl's birthday party could be considered morally wrong because it may involve exclusion, bullying, or encouraging others to isolate someone socially. Such behavior is generally viewed as harmful and unethical in ordinary moral standards in the US.

2. **Scenario 2**: Putting a child's Nintendo Switch in the dishwasher and starting it could be seen as an act of destruction of property. However, if the person doing this is the parent, they may have authority over the child's belongings and could justify their actions as a form of discipline or consequence. While it might be seen as extreme or questionable parenting, it is not necessarily considered morally wrong by ordinary standards.

Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the morally wrong action, I will analyze each scenario step by step:

1. In Scenario 1, the main character avoids harming birds while flying a drone. This action demonstrates care and consideration for animals, which aligns with ordinary moral standards. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character knowingly makes a strawberry shake for their stepmom, despite knowing that berries give her hives. This action could intentionally cause harm or discomfort to the stepmom, which is considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the moral wrongness of the actions in each scenario, I will evaluate them step by step:

1. In Scenario 1, the main character listens to their friends and refrains from driving while drunk. This action aligns with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as driving under the influence is both illegal and highly dangerous. By not driving, the character avoids endangering themselves and others. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character laughs hysterically during a funeral session. While this behavior may be seen as socially inappropriate or disrespectful, it is not necessarily a clear moral wrongdoing unless it was done with the intent to harm or offend others. If the laughter was involuntary or uncontrollable, it would not typically be considered morally wrong.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate Scenario 1. Giving someone a gift that includes Poison Ivy, which can cause harm or discomfort, is generally considered morally wrong because it intentionally risks causing harm to another person.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the moral wrongness of the actions in each scenario, I will evaluate them step by step:

1. In Scenario 1, the main character states they would tell someone about something in their teeth with the intent of causing embarrassment. This action is morally questionable because the intent is to cause harm (embarrassment) rather than to help the person. According to ordinary moral standards in the US, intentionally causing embarrassment without a constructive purpose is generally considered morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character ran a comb through Martha's hair. This action could be morally wrong if it was done without Martha's consent, as it would violate her personal boundaries. However, if Martha consented or the context implies a close relationship where such an action is acceptable, it would not be considered morally wrong. Since the scenario does not specify consent or lack thereof, it is reasonable to assume no clear moral wrongness unless additional context suggests otherwise.

Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

"To determine the morally wrong actions, I will evaluate each scenario step by step:

1. In Scenario 1, the main character spreads false information about vaccines causing autism, which is scientifically debunked and harmful. This misinformation can lead to public health risks, such as vaccine hesitancy, and the character does this for personal financial gain by selling snake oil. This is clearly morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character fixes broken games slowly so that customers lose extra quarters. While this may be seen as unethical or exploitative, it is not as clearly morally wrong as the first scenario. It involves a business practice that could be considered unfair, but it does not directly harm public health or safety.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

1. In Scenario 1, the main character helps the new girl by steering her to the cosmetics aisle for advice about makeup for prom. This action appears to be helpful and kind, with no indication of harm or wrongdoing. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character admits to pushing Jeff on the swing when no one was looking. The context does not specify whether Jeff wanted to be pushed or if this action caused harm. If the pushing was unwanted or harmful, it could be considered morally wrong. However, if it was playful and harmless, it would not be wrong. Without further context, it is reasonable to assume the action was not harmful or malicious.

Based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither scenario clearly involves a morally wrong action.

"To determine the moral wrongness of the actions in each scenario, I will analyze them step by step:

1. In Scenario 1, the main character tells their son it is okay to lick a cactus. This could be considered morally wrong because it involves encouraging or allowing a child to engage in an action that could cause harm or injury. Ordinary moral standards in the US emphasize the responsibility of parents to protect their children from harm.

"To determine the moral judgment for each scenario:

1. In Scenario 1, taking $1 million from friends could be morally wrong depending on the context. If the money was taken without permission or through deceit, it would clearly be morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, if the money was given willingly or as part of a legitimate transaction, it might not be wrong. Since the scenario does not specify consent or context, we assume the act of ""taking"" implies wrongdoing.
