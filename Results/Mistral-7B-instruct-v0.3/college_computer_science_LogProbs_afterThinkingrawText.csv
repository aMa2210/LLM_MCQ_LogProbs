"Input: The access matrix approach to protection has the difficulty that Choices: a) the matrix, if stored directly, is large and can be clumsy to manage b) it is not capable of expressing complex protection requirements c) deciding whether a process has access to a resource is undecidable d) there is no way to express who has rights to change the access matrix itself 
Output:
First, I need to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the access matrix approach to protection.
a) The matrix, if stored directly, is large and can be clumsy to manage. This is a disadvantage as it requires a lot of memory and can be difficult to manipulate.
b) It is not capable of expressing complex protection requirements. This is also a disadvantage as it may not be able to handle more complex scenarios.
c) Deciding whether a process has access to a resource is undecidable. This is not a disadvantage of the access matrix approach itself, but rather a fundamental problem in computer security.
d) There is no way to express who has rights to change the access matrix itself. This is a disadvantage as it may limit the ability to manage and update the access matrix.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: An integer c is a common divisor of two integers x and y if and only if c is a divisor of x and c is a divisor of y. Which of the following sets of integers could possibly be the set of all common divisors of two integers? Choices: a) {-6,-2, -1, 1, 2, 6} b) {-6, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 6} c) {-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6} d) {-6, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6} 
Output:
First, I need to understand that the set of all common divisors of two integers includes all positive and negative numbers that can divide both integers without leaving a remainder.
a) {-6,-2, -1, 1, 2, 6} does not include 0, which is a common divisor of any two integers, so it cannot be the set of all common divisors.
b) {-6, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 6} includes 0, but it does not include any positive divisors of the two integers, so it cannot be the set of all common divisors.
c) {-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6} includes 0, and it includes all positive and negative divisors of the two integers, so it could be the set of all common divisors.
d) {-6, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6} includes 0, and it includes all positive and negative divisors of the two integers, so it could be the set of all common divisors.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c' or 'd'}."
"Input: In the NoNicks operating system, the time required by a single file-read operation has four nonoverlapping components:
disk seek time-25 msec
disk latency time-8 msec
disk transfer time- 1 msec per 1,000 bytes
operating system overhead-1 msec per 1,000 bytes + 10 msec
In version 1 of the system, the file read retrieved blocks of 1,000 bytes. In version 2, the file read (along with the underlying layout on disk) was modified to retrieve blocks of 4,000 bytes. The ratio of-the time required to read a large file under version 2 to the time required to read the same large file under version 1 is approximately Choices: a) 1:4 b) 1:3.5 c) 1:1 d) 1.1:1 
Output:
First, I need to calculate the time required to read a block of 1,000 bytes under version 1. The time is the sum of the disk seek time, disk latency time, disk transfer time, and operating system overhead.
For the disk transfer time, I need to multiply the number of bytes by the time per byte: 1,000 bytes * 1 msec/1,000 bytes = 1 msec.
The total time for version 1 is 25 msec (disk seek time) + 8 msec (disk latency time) + 1 msec (disk transfer time) + 1 msec (operating system overhead) + 10 msec (operating system overhead for 1,000 bytes) = 45 msec.
Next, I need to calculate the time required to read a block of 4,000 bytes under version 2. The disk transfer time will be different because it depends on the number of bytes.
For the disk transfer time, I need to multiply the number of bytes by the time per byte: 4,000 bytes * 1 msec/1,000 bytes = 4 msec.
The total time for version 2 is 25 msec (disk seek time) + 8 msec (disk latency time) + 4 msec (disk transfer time) + 1 msec (operating system overhead) + 10 msec (operating system overhead for 4,000 bytes) = 48 msec.
Now, I need to find the ratio of the time required to read a large file under version 2 to the time required to read the same large file under version 1. I divide the total time for version 2 by the total time for version 1: 48 msec ÷ 45 msec = 1.067.
However, the question asks for an approximate ratio, so I'll round it to the nearest multiple of 0.1: 1.1:1.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: You want to cluster 7 points into 3 clusters using the k-Means Clustering algorithm. Suppose after the first iteration, clusters C1, C2 and C3 contain the following two-dimensional points: C1 contains the 2 points: {(0,6), (6,0)} C2 contains the 3 points: {(2,2), (4,4), (6,6)} C3 contains the 2 points: {(5,5), (7,7)} What are the cluster centers computed for these 3 clusters? Choices: a) C1: (3,3), C2: (4,4), C3: (6,6) b) C1: (3,3), C2: (6,6), C3: (12,12) c) C1: (6,6), C2: (12,12), C3: (12,12) d) C1: (0,0), C2: (48,48), C3: (35,35) 
Output:
First, I need to calculate the mean of the points in each cluster.
For C1, the mean is (0+6)/2 = 3 and (6+0)/2 = 3, so the mean is (3,3).
For C2, the mean is ((2+2+4+4+6)/5 = 4 and (2+2+4+4+6)/5 = 4, so the mean is (4,4).
For C3, the mean is (5+5)/2 = 5 and (7+7)/2 = 7, so the mean is (5,7).
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Any set of Boolean operators that is sufficient to represent all Boolean expressions is said to be complete. Which of the following is NOT complete? Choices: a) {AND, NOT} b) {NOT, OR} c) {AND, OR} d) {NAND} 
Output:
First, I need to understand what a complete set of Boolean operators means. A complete set is one that can represent all possible Boolean expressions.
a) {AND, NOT} can represent all expressions except OR, so it is not complete.
b) {NOT, OR} can represent all expressions except AND, so it is not complete.
c) {AND, OR} can represent all possible expressions, so it is complete.
d) {NAND} is a single operator that represents both AND and NOT, but not OR. It cannot represent all possible expressions, so it is not complete.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Consider the collection of all undirected graphs with 10 nodes and 6 edges. Let M and m, respectively, be the maximum and minimum number of connected components in any graph in the collection. If a graph has no selfloops and there is at most one edge between any pair of nodes, which of the following is true? Choices: a) M = 10, m = 10 b) M = 10, m = 1 c) M = 7, m = 4 d) M = 6, m = 4 
Output:
First, I need to understand the conditions given. The collection of graphs has 10 nodes and 6 edges, with no self-loops and at most one edge between any pair of nodes.

Next, I need to consider the maximum number of connected components (M) in any graph from the collection. Since there are no self-loops, a single node graph is not possible, so M cannot be 1.

If we consider a graph with 10 nodes and 6 edges, each edge connecting a pair of nodes, we would have 10 nodes connected in a single component. However, this graph would have 9 edges, not 6.

To have 6 edges, we can remove one edge from the connected graph. Removing an edge will create two connected components. So, the maximum number of connected components (M) is 2.

Now, I need to consider the minimum number of connected components (m). Since the graph cannot have self-loops, the minimum number of connected components is at least 2 (one for each pair of nodes connected by an edge).

However, it is possible to have a graph with 3 connected components. For example, a graph with 3 nodes connected in a single component, and the remaining 7 nodes each forming their own component. This graph would have 3 + 7 - 6 = 4 connected components.

So, the minimum number of connected components (m) is 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Resolution theorem proving for showing that a formula of propositional logic is not satisfiable has which of the following properties?
I. It is a sound proof system in the sense that there does not exist a proof of the unsatisfiability of a satisfiable formula of propositional logic.
II. It is a complete proof system in the sense that there is a proof of unsatisfiability for every unsa tisfiable formula of propositional logic.
III. It is a succinct proof system in the sense that whenever an unsatisfiable formula F of propositional logic has a resolution proof, F also has a proof whose length is polynomial in the length of F. Choices: a) I only b) III only c) I and II only d) I and III only 
Output:
First, I need to understand the properties of resolution theorem proving for showing that a formula of propositional logic is not satisfiable.
I. It is a sound proof system in the sense that there does not exist a proof of the satisfiability of an unsatisfiable formula of propositional logic. This is true, as a proof of satisfiability for an unsatisfiable formula would lead to a contradiction.
II. It is a complete proof system in the sense that there is a proof of unsatisfiability for every unsa tisfiable formula of propositional logic. This is not necessarily true, as there may exist unsa tisfiable formulas that do not have a resolution proof.
III. It is a succinct proof system in the sense that whenever an unsatisfiable formula F of propositional logic has a resolution proof, F also has a proof whose length is polynomial in the length of F. This is true, as resolution proofs can be constructed in a way that their length is polynomial in the length of the formula.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Which of the following statements describe(s) properties of a purely segmented memory system?
I. It divides memory into units of equal size.
II. It permits implementation of virtual memory.
III. It suffers from internal fragmentation. Choices: a) I only b) II only c) III only d) I and III 
Output:
First, I need to identify the properties of a purely segmented memory system. A purely segmented memory system divides memory into units of equal size, which corresponds to statement I. It also suffers from internal fragmentation, which corresponds to statement III.
However, a purely segmented memory system does not permit implementation of virtual memory, which corresponds to statement II.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Which of the following statements about floating-point arithmetic is NOT true? Choices: a) It is inherently nonassociative because some numbers have no exact representation. b) It is inherently nonassociative because there have to be upper and lower bounds on the size of numbers. c) Associativity can be achieved with appropriate roundoff conventions. d) Some rational numbers have no exact representation. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the statement that is NOT true about floating-point arithmetic.
a) It is inherently nonassociative because some numbers have no exact representation. This statement is true.
b) It is inherently nonassociative because there have to be upper and lower bounds on the size of numbers. This statement is true.
c) Associativity can be achieved with appropriate roundoff conventions. This statement is false. Floating-point arithmetic is not inherently associative, and roundoff conventions can only help to minimize the errors introduced by the finite precision of floating-point numbers, but they cannot make it associative.
d) Some rational numbers have no exact representation. This statement is true.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Suppose sharing of tiles in a multilevel directory structure is achieved with directory entries that are links pointing to a node containing information about a shared file. Information in this node includes (1) the owner of the file, (2) a count of the number of links to the tile, and (3) the disk block numbers of the file. What is a primary drawback to this approach to sharing? Choices: a) If the owner modifies the file, another user who does not share will see the changes. b) If the owner renames the file, other users will not be able to access it. c) If the owner is allowed to delete a file, dangling links may result. d) If any user who shares the file appends to it, others who share it will not be able to access the new disk blocks. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the scenario where a user who shares the file modifies it.
In this approach, the shared file's information is stored in a node that is linked by directory entries.
If the owner modifies the file, the changes will only be reflected in the node that the owner has access to.
However, other users who share the file will still have links pointing to the old node, which does not contain the updated information.
Therefore, they will not see the changes made by the owner.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Mergesort works by splitting a list of n numbers in half, sorting each half recursively, and merging the two halves. Which of the following data structures will allow mergesort to work in O(n log n) time?
I. A singly linked list
II. A doubly linked list
III. An array Choices: a) None b) III only c) I and II only d) I, II, and III 
Output:
First, I need to understand the requirements for Mergesort to work efficiently. Mergesort requires a data structure that allows for easy access to any element, and also allows for easy swapping of elements.

I. A singly linked list does not allow for easy access to any element, as you have to traverse the list from the beginning to reach any element. Therefore, it is not suitable for Mergesort.

II. A doubly linked list allows for easy access to any element, as you can traverse the list in both directions. However, it does not allow for easy swapping of elements, as you would have to change the pointers in both directions. Therefore, it is not suitable for Mergesort.

III. An array allows for easy access to any element, as you can simply use an index to access any element. It also allows for easy swapping of elements, as you can simply swap the values at two indices. Therefore, it is suitable for Mergesort.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: If p(x) is the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial for the real-valued function f(x) at the n + 1 distinct real numbers x0, .... xn what is the maximum possible degree of p(x)? Choices: a) n b) n + 1 c) n + 2 d) 2n 
Output:
First, I need to understand that the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial is the polynomial of the lowest degree that passes through all the given points.
The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable (x) in the polynomial.
Since the polynomial needs to pass through n + 1 distinct points, it must have at least n + 1 coefficients.
Each coefficient is determined by one of the points, so the maximum degree of the polynomial is the maximum number of independent variables that can be determined by n + 1 distinct points.
In this case, the maximum number of independent variables that can be determined by n + 1 distinct points is n, because each point determines one variable and we have n + 1 points.
Therefore, the maximum degree of the polynomial is n + 1, so the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: An internal hash table has 5 buckets, numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Keys are integers, and the hash function h(i) = i mod 5 is used, with linear resolution of collisions (i.e., if bucket h(i) is filled, the buckets h(i) + 1, h(i) + 2, ... are tried successively with all bucket numbers computed modulo 5). If elements with keys 13, 8, 24, 10, and 3 are inserted, m that order, into an initially blank hash table, then the content of the bucket numbered 2 is Choices: a) 3 b) 8 c) 10 d) 13 
Output:
First, I need to insert the elements into the hash table using the given hash function.
For key 13, h(13) = 13 mod 5 = 3. Since bucket 3 is empty, I insert the element with key 13 into bucket 3.
For key 8, h(8) = 8 mod 5 = 3. Since bucket 3 is already occupied, I try the next bucket, h(8) + 1 = 4. Since bucket 4 is empty, I insert the element with key 8 into bucket 4.
For key 24, h(24) = 24 mod 5 = 4. Since bucket 4 is already occupied, I try the next bucket, h(24) + 1 = 5. Since bucket 5 is empty, I insert the element with key 24 into bucket 5.
For key 10, h(10) = 10 mod 5 = 0. Since bucket 0 is empty, I insert the element with key 10 into bucket 0.
For key 3, h(3) = 3 mod 5 = 3. Since bucket 3 is already occupied, I try the next bucket, h(3) + 1 = 4. Since bucket 4 is already occupied, I try the next bucket, h(3) + 2 = 5. Since bucket 5 is already occupied, I try the next bucket, h(3) + 3 = 0. Since bucket 0 is already occupied, I try the next bucket, h(3) + 4 = 1. Since bucket 1 is empty, I insert the element with key 3 into bucket 1.
Therefore, the content of the bucket numbered 2 is empty, so the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: TCP protocol is responsible (among other things) for Choices: a) Routing packets through the network b) Reliable delivery of packets between directly connected machines c) Reliable delivery of large (multi-packet) messages between machines that are not necessarily directly connected d) Dealing with differences among operating system architectures 
Output:
First, I need to understand the function of TCP protocol. TCP is a transport layer protocol that provides reliable, stream-oriented, and connection-based communication between applications running on the internet.
TCP is responsible for reliable delivery of packets between directly connected machines, which means it ensures that packets are delivered in the correct order and without errors. It also provides flow control and congestion control to manage the rate of data transmission and prevent network congestion.
However, TCP is not directly responsible for routing packets through the network, dealing with differences among operating system architectures, or reliable delivery of large (multi-packet) messages between machines that are not necessarily directly connected.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Let A and B be two sets of words (strings) from Σ*, for some alphabet of symbols Σ. Suppose that B is a subset of A. Which of the following statements must always be true of A and B ?
I. If A is finite, then B is finite.
II. If A is regular, then B is regular.
III. If A is context-free, then B is context-free. Choices: a) I only b) II only c) III only d) I and II only 
Output:
First, I need to understand the given statements.
I. If A is finite, then B is finite. This means that if A has a finite number of elements, then B must also have a finite number of elements because it is a subset of A.
II. If A is regular, then B is regular. A regular language is a language that can be described by a regular expression or a finite automaton. If A is regular, it means that it can be described by one of these methods, and since B is a subset of A, it can also be described by the same regular expression or finite automaton, making it regular as well.
III. If A is context-free, then B is context-free. A context-free language is a language that can be described by a context-free grammar. If A is context-free, it means that it can be described by a context-free grammar, but this does not necessarily mean that B can be described by the same grammar because B is a subset of A, and subsets do not always inherit the properties of the larger set.

Now, let's analyze the given choices:
a) I only: This is not always true because a finite set can have a subset that is infinite. For example, the set {1, 2, 3, ..., n} is finite, but the subset of even numbers {2, 4, 6, ...} is infinite.
b) II only: This is true because if A is regular, then B is also regular.
c) III only: This is not always true because a context-free language can have a subset that is not context-free. For example, the context-free language {a^n b^n | n >= 0} (a sequence of a's followed by an equal number of b's) has the subset {a^n | n >= 0}, which is not context-free because it cannot be described by a context-free grammar.
d) I and II only: This is not true because I is not always true, as shown above.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: For all strings x, the function x^M is defined recursively as follows.
e^M= e, and
if w is a string and a is a string with length 1, then
(aw)^M = aw^Ma.
Let a be a string with length 1, and let x and y be arbitrary strings. Which of the following is true? Choices: a) a^M = a b) (ax)^M = (xa)^M c) (xy)^M = y^Mx^M d) None of the above 
Output:
First, I need to understand the definition of the function x^M. According to the definition, e^M = e, and (aw)^M = aw^Ma for any string w and character a.
a) a^M is defined as a, so a^M = a.
b) (ax)^M is defined as ax^M, and x^M is defined as x^Ma. Therefore, (ax)^M = (xa)^M.
c) (xy)^M is defined as xy^M, and y^M is defined as y^Ma. However, xy is not a string, so this expression is not defined according to the given definition.
d) None of the above is not true, as all the given expressions are true according to the definition.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Which of the following is NOT a reasonable justification for choosing to busy-wait on an asynchronous event? Choices: a) The wait is expected to be short. b) A busy-wait loop is easier to code than an interrupt handler. c) There is no other work for the processor to do. d) The program executes on a time-sharing system. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the option that is NOT a reasonable justification for choosing to busy-wait on an asynchronous event.
a) The wait is expected to be short. - This is a reasonable justification as busy-waiting can be efficient for short waits.
b) A busy-wait loop is easier to code than an interrupt handler. - This is not necessarily true, as interrupt handlers can be more complex but are more efficient for long waits.
c) There is no other work for the processor to do. - This is a reasonable justification as busy-waiting can be useful when there is no other work for the processor to do.
d) The program executes on a time-sharing system. - This is not a reasonable justification as busy-waiting can lead to poor performance in a time-sharing system due to the processor being unavailable for other tasks.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: The language {ww | w in (0 + 1)*} is Choices: a) not accepted by any Turing machine b) accepted by some Turing machine, but by no pushdown automaton c) accepted by some pushdown automaton, but not context-free d) context-free, but not regular 
Output:
First, I need to identify the language described. The language {ww | w in (0 + 1)*} is a language where the string consists of zero or more repetitions of a single 0 or 1. This language is called the palindrome language over {0, 1}.
Next, I need to determine which type of automaton can accept this language. A Turing machine can accept this language because it can simulate the repetition of symbols and check for palindromes.
However, a pushdown automaton cannot accept this language because it does not have the ability to simulate repetition of symbols in the same way a Turing machine can.
A pushdown automaton can accept some context-free languages, but not all of them. This language is context-free because it can be generated by a context-free grammar.
A regular language is a language that can be accepted by a finite automaton. This language is not regular because it does not have a finite number of states that can represent all possible palindromes.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Which of the following statements about Ethernets is typically FALSE? Choices: a) Ethernets use circuit switching to send messages. b) Ethernets use buses with multiple masters. c) Ethernet protocols use a collision-detection method to ensure that messages are transmitted properly. d) Networks connected by Ethernets are limited in length to a few hundred meters. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the statement that is typically FALSE about Ethernets.
a) Ethernets use packet switching, not circuit switching, to send messages.
b) Ethernets use a star topology, not a bus topology with multiple masters.
c) Ethernet protocols use a collision-detection method to ensure that messages are transmitted properly.
d) Networks connected by Ethernets can be much longer than a few hundred meters, depending on the type of Ethernet and the use of repeaters or switches.
Therefore, the statement that is typically FALSE is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Let P be a procedure that for some inputs calls itself (i.e., is recursive). If P is guaranteed to terminate, which of the following statements must be true?
I. P has a local variable.
II. P has an execution path where it does not call itself.
III. P either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter. Choices: a) I only b) II only c) I and II only d) II and III only 
Output:
First, I need to understand the question. The question asks which of the given statements must be true if a recursive procedure P is guaranteed to terminate.
I. P has a local variable: This statement is not necessarily true. A recursive procedure can have local variables, but it can also not have any local variables.
II. P has an execution path where it does not call itself: This statement is true. A recursive procedure must eventually reach a base case where it does not call itself.
III. P either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter: This statement is not necessarily true. A recursive procedure can refer to global variables or have parameters, but it can also not have any global variables or parameters.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Which of the following comes closest to being a perfectly secure encryption scheme? Choices: a) The Caesar Cipher, a substitution cipher b) DES (Data Encryption Standard), a symmetric-key algorithm c) Enigma, a transposition cipher d) One-time pad 
Output:
First, I need to understand the properties of each encryption scheme.
a) The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a certain number of positions. It is not perfectly secure because it can be easily broken with frequency analysis.
b) DES is a symmetric-key algorithm that uses a 56-bit key. It is not perfectly secure because it has been broken with brute force attacks and is considered outdated.
c) Enigma is a transposition cipher that uses a complex electrical machine to scramble the plaintext. It is not perfectly secure because it can be broken with the help of a bombe machine or by analyzing the electrical patterns of the machine.
d) One-time pad is a perfectly secure encryption scheme because it uses a random key that is as long as the plaintext and is used only once. It is unbreakable as long as the key is truly random and kept secret.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Of the following problems concerning a given undirected graph G, which is currently known to be solvable in polynomial time? Choices: a) Finding a longest simple cycle in G b) Finding a shortest cycle in G c) Finding ALL spanning trees of G d) Finding a largest clique in G 
Output:
First, I need to understand the problem statements.
a) Finding a longest simple cycle in G: This problem is NP-hard, meaning it is not known to be solvable in polynomial time.
b) Finding a shortest cycle in G: This problem is also NP-hard, meaning it is not known to be solvable in polynomial time.
c) Finding ALL spanning trees of G: This problem can be solved in polynomial time using Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm.
d) Finding a largest clique in G: This problem is NP-hard, meaning it is not known to be solvable in polynomial time.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: The IP protocol is primarily concerned with Choices: a) Routing packets through the network b) Reliable delivery of packets between directly connected machines c) Reliable delivery of large (multi-packet) messages between machines that are not necessarily directly connected d) Dealing with differences among operating system architectures 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the IP protocol. The IP protocol is a network protocol that is responsible for routing packets (data) from one device to another on the internet.
So, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Of the following, which best approximates the ratio of the number of nonterminal nodes to the total number of nodes in a complete K-ary tree of depth N? Choices: a) 1/K b) K-1/K c) log_10 (1/N) d) N-1/m 
Output:
First, I need to understand the structure of a complete K-ary tree. A complete K-ary tree is a tree in which all levels, except possibly the last, are completely filled, and all nodes at the last level are as far left as possible.

In a complete K-ary tree of depth N, the number of nodes at the last level is K^(N-1), because each node at the previous level branches out to K nodes at the next level.

The total number of nodes in a complete K-ary tree of depth N is 1 + K + K^2 + ... + K^(N-1). This is a geometric series with first term 1, common ratio K, and N terms. The sum of a geometric series is given by the formula S = a * (1 - r^N) / (1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and N is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 1, r = K, and N = N-1 (because the last level has K^(N-1) nodes, not K^N nodes). So, the total number of nodes is 1 + K + K^2 + ... + K^(N-1) = 1 * (1 - K^N) / (1 - K) = (1 - K^N) / (K - 1).

The number of nonterminal nodes is the total number of nodes minus the number of leaves, which is the number of nodes at the last level. So, the number of nonterminal nodes is (1 - K^N) / (K - 1) - K^(N-1).

The ratio of the number of nonterminal nodes to the total number of nodes is ((1 - K^N) / (K - 1) - K^(N-1)) / ((1 - K^N) / (K - 1)). Simplifying this fraction, I get (1 - K^N - K^(N-1)) / (K - 1).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Consider a computer system in which processes can request and release one or more resources. Once a process has been granted a resource, the process has exclusive use of that resource until it is released. If a process requests a resource that is already in use, the process enters a queue for that resource, waiting until the resource is available. Which of the following will NOT deal effectively with the problem of deadlock? Choices: a) Giving priorities to processes and ordering the wait queues by priority b) Having a process request all its required resources when it first begins, and restarting if it cannot obtain them all c) Numbering the resources and requiring that processes request resources in order of increasing number d) Having processes time out and restart after a random interval of waiting 
Output:
First, I need to understand the problem of deadlock. Deadlock occurs when two or more processes are blocked, each waiting for a resource that the other process holds.
Now, let's analyze the given choices:
a) Giving priorities to processes and ordering the wait queues by priority: This might help reduce the waiting time for processes, but it does not prevent deadlock since a high-priority process can still be blocked by a low-priority process holding a resource.
b) Having a process request all its required resources when it first begins, and restarting if it cannot obtain them all: This approach can help prevent deadlock because a process will not start if it cannot obtain all its resources. However, it can lead to unnecessary restarts and waste of resources.
c) Numbering the resources and requiring that processes request resources in order of increasing number: This approach can help prevent circular waits, a common cause of deadlock. If a process requests a resource that is already in use by another process with a lower-numbered resource, it will have to wait.
d) Having processes time out and restart after a random interval of waiting: This approach can help prevent deadlock by forcing processes to give up resources if they are not released within a certain time. However, it does not guarantee that the process will be able to obtain the resources when it restarts.
Therefore, the choice that will NOT deal effectively with the problem of deadlock is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: ""Magic memory""' has two operations: Read and Clear. Both are indivisible and mutually exclusive. Clear sets the magic memory to zero. Read returns a value that represents the number of Read operations since the last Clear operation. Which of the following is (are) true of ""Magic memory""?
I. It can provide the functionality of an atomic Test-and-Set.
II. It can be used to coordinate processes running on a shared-memory multiprocessor.
III. It is only useful on a multiprocessor. Choices: a) I only b) II only c) III only d) I and II 
Output:
First, I need to understand the operations of the Magic memory. It can read a value and clear itself, but it doesn't seem to have a way to set a specific value.

I. Test-and-Set operation is a common atomic operation in concurrent programming, which reads a value and then sets it to a new value in a single indivisible step. Since the Magic memory can read a value and clear itself, it can provide the functionality of a Test-and-Set operation.

II. Coordinating processes running on a shared-memory multiprocessor is a common use case for atomic operations like Test-and-Set. Since the Magic memory can provide the functionality of a Test-and-Set operation, it can be used to coordinate processes running on a shared-memory multiprocessor.

III. The Magic memory can be used on a single-processor system as well, as long as it has shared memory. However, it is particularly useful on a multiprocessor system because it can help manage concurrent access to shared resources.

Therefore, the Magic memory can provide the functionality of an atomic Test-and-Set and can be used to coordinate processes running on a shared-memory multiprocessor. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Which of the following is the name of the data structure in a compiler that is responsible for managing information about variables and their attributes? Choices: a) Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) b) Attribute Grammar c) Symbol Table d) Semantic Stack 
Output:
First, I need to identify the data structure that manages information about variables and their attributes.
a) Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code. It does not manage variable information.
b) Attribute Grammar is a formalism used in compiler design to associate values with the symbols in a grammar. It does not manage variable information.
c) Symbol Table is a data structure used by compilers to store information about identifiers, such as their type, scope, and value. This is the correct answer.
d) Semantic Stack is a data structure used in compiler design to store temporary values during the parsing process. It does not manage variable information.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Which of the following algorithms has running time Θ(n^2) in the worst case but Θ(n log n) on average? Choices: a) Bubblesort b) Mergesort c) Heapsort d) Quicksort 
Output:
First, I need to understand the running times of each algorithm.
a) Bubblesort has a worst-case running time of Θ(n^2) and an average-case running time of Θ(n).
b) Mergesort has a worst-case running time of Θ(n log n) and an average-case running time of Θ(n log n).
c) Heapsort has a worst-case running time of Θ(n log n) and an average-case running time of Θ(n log n).
d) Quicksort has a worst-case running time of Θ(n^2) in the worst case (when the input is already sorted or reverse sorted) and an average-case running time of Θ(n log n).

Therefore, the algorithm that has running time Θ(n^2) in the worst case but Θ(n log n) on average is Quicksort. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Languages with a structure that implements abstract data types (e.g., a C++ class) can prevent access to components of this structure by all operations except those that are part of this structure. However, definitions of such a structure often contain declarations of components of the structure (e.g., the header file for a C++ class may contain declarations of its private components). For such a language, an object's name could be bound at run time to stack storage for its component values (direct representation) or to a stack pointer referencing heap storage for its component values (indirect representation). Which of the following statements about comparisons between direct and indirect representations is (are) true?
I. Indirect representation noticeably increases compilation time.
II. Direct representation decreases the time needed to access components of a variable.
III. When the storage size of some private component of a variable changes, indirect representation minimizes the number of recompilations of source modules that must be performed. Choices: a) I only b) III only c) I and II only d) II and III only 
Output:
First, I need to analyze each statement.
I. Indirect representation may increase compilation time because it requires the creation of additional pointers and memory management operations. However, the increase may not be noticeable in modern compilers.
II. Direct representation decreases the time needed to access components of a variable because it eliminates the need for pointer dereferencing.
III. When the storage size of some private component of a variable changes, indirect representation may require recompilation of source modules that use the variable, while direct representation does not.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Which of the following is NOT a property of bitmap graphics? Choices: a) Fast hardware exists to move blocks of pixels efficiently. b) Realistic lighting and shading can be done. c) All line segments can be displayed as straight. d) Polygons can be filled with solid colors and textures. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the property that is NOT a property of bitmap graphics.
a) Fast hardware exists to move blocks of pixels efficiently is a property of bitmap graphics.
b) Realistic lighting and shading can be done is NOT a property of bitmap graphics. Bitmap graphics are made up of individual pixels, and they do not have the ability to simulate complex lighting and shading effects like those found in 3D graphics.
c) All line segments can be displayed as straight is a property of bitmap graphics.
d) Polygons can be filled with solid colors and textures is a property of bitmap graphics.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Which of the following is true of interrupts? Choices: a) They are generated when memory cycles are ""stolen"". b) They are used in place of data channels. c) They can indicate completion of an I/O operation. d) They cannot be generated by arithmetic operations. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the given choices.
a) They are generated when memory cycles are ""stolen"" - This is true. Interrupts are generated when the CPU is interrupted from its current task to handle an event, such as an I/O operation or a hardware error.
b) They are used in place of data channels - This is false. Data channels are used for transmitting data between devices, while interrupts are signals that indicate an event has occurred.
c) They can indicate completion of an I/O operation - This is true. Interrupts can be used to signal the completion of an I/O operation, allowing the CPU to resume its main task.
d) They cannot be generated by arithmetic operations - This is false. Interrupts can be generated by arithmetic operations, such as a division by zero or an overflow error.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: In a height-balanced binary search tree, the heights of the left and right descendents of any node differ by at most 1. Which of the following are true of such a tree?
I. Worst-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes.
II. Average-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes.
III. Best-case search time is proportional to the height of the tree.
IV. The height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes. Choices: a) I and III only b) II and III only c) II and IV only d) I, II, and IV 
Output:
First, I need to understand the properties of a height-balanced binary search tree. The height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes because the tree is balanced, meaning the height of the tree is close to logarithmic in the number of nodes.
Second, the search operation in a binary search tree is efficient, with a worst-case, average-case, and best-case time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of nodes.
Third, the height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes, so the best-case search time is still O(log n) because the height of the tree is a good indicator of the number of comparisons needed to find a node.
Therefore, all of the statements I, II, and IV are true for a height-balanced binary search tree. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Bob writes down a number between 1 and 1,000. Mary must identify that number by asking ""yes/no"" questions of Bob. Mary knows that Bob always tells the truth. If Mary uses an optimal strategy, then she will determine the answer at the end of exactly how many questions in the worst case? Choices: a) 1,000 b) 999 c) 500 d) 10 
Output:
First, I need to find the optimal strategy for Mary to determine the number. Since Bob always tells the truth, Mary can ask a series of questions to eliminate half of the possible numbers at each step.
For example, if Mary asks ""Is your number greater than 500?"", Bob will answer either ""yes"" or ""no"". If Bob answers ""yes"", then the number is between 501 and 1000, and if Bob answers ""no"", then the number is between 1 and 500.
By asking a series of such questions, Mary can eliminate half of the possible numbers at each step.
In the worst case, Mary will need to ask log2(1000) questions to determine the number, as she starts with 1000 possibilities and eliminates half at each step.
The base 2 logarithm of 1000 is approximately 10, so the answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Which of the following is (are) true about virtual memory systems that use pages?
I. The virtual address space can be larger than the amount of physical memory.
II. Programs must be resident in main memory throughout their execution.
III. Pages correspond to semantic characteristics of the program. Choices: a) I only b) II only c) I and II d) I and III 
Output:
First, I need to consider each statement.
I. The virtual address space can be larger than the amount of physical memory. This is true because virtual memory systems use pages, which are smaller units of memory than the entire program. The virtual address space can be larger than the physical memory because the operating system can swap pages in and out of main memory as needed.
II. Programs must be resident in main memory throughout their execution. This is false because virtual memory systems allow programs to be swapped in and out of main memory as needed, so they do not need to be resident in main memory throughout their execution.
III. Pages correspond to semantic characteristics of the program. This is not necessarily true. Pages are simply smaller units of memory, and they do not necessarily correspond to semantic characteristics of the program.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Which of the following is usually NOT represented in a subroutine's activation record frame for a stack-based programming language? Choices: a) Values of local variables b) A heap area c) The return address d) Stack pointer for the calling activation record 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context. A subroutine's activation record frame is a data structure that stores information about the subroutine's local variables, the return address, and the stack pointer for the calling activation record.
In a stack-based programming language, the heap area is not part of the activation record frame. The heap is a region of memory that is dynamically allocated during runtime, and it is not managed by the activation record frame.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Which of the following statements about a remote procedure call is true? Choices: a) It is used to call procedures with addresses that are farther than 2^16 bytes away. b) It cannot return a value. c) It cannot pass parameters by reference. d) It cannot call procedures implemented in a different language. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of a remote procedure call (RPC). RPC is a protocol that allows a program to call a subroutine or a function on another program, which may be running in another address space, on another computer, or even on another network.
Now, let's analyze the given choices:
a) The statement is false. RPC is not limited by the 2^16 bytes address space.
b) The statement is false. RPC can return a value.
c) The statement is false. RPC can pass parameters by reference.
d) The statement is true. RPC is designed to call procedures implemented in different languages, but it requires the use of language-specific mapping tools.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Of the following sorting algorithms, which has a running time that is LEAST dependent on the initial ordering of the input? Choices: a) Insertion sort b) Quicksort c) Merge sort d) Selection sort 
Output:
First, I need to understand the running time of each sorting algorithm.
a) Insertion sort has a running time of O(n^2) in the worst case, which is when the input is reverse sorted. So, its running time is more dependent on the initial ordering of the input.
b) Quicksort has an average running time of O(n log n), but its worst-case running time is O(n^2), which occurs when the input is reverse sorted or when the pivot is always the smallest or largest element. So, its running time is also somewhat dependent on the initial ordering of the input.
c) Merge sort has a running time of O(n log n) in all cases, regardless of the initial ordering of the input.
d) Selection sort has a running time of O(n^2) in the best case (when the input is already sorted), O(n^2) in the average case, and O(n^2) in the worst case (when the input is reverse sorted). So, its running time is most dependent on the initial ordering of the input.
Therefore, the sorting algorithm that has a running time that is LEAST dependent on the initial ordering of the input is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: A particular parallel program computation requires 100 seconds when executed on a single processor. If 40 percent of this computation is ""inherently sequential"" (i.e., will not benefit from additional processors), then the theoretically best possible elapsed times for this program running with 2 and 4 processors, respectively, are Choices: a) 20 and 10 seconds b) 30 and 15 seconds c) 50 and 25 seconds d) 70 and 55 seconds 
Output:
First, I need to find the time required for the sequential part of the computation. Since 40 percent of the computation is sequential, the remaining 60 percent will benefit from additional processors. So, the time required for the parallel part of the computation is 100 * 0.6 = 60 seconds.
Now, I need to find the theoretically best possible elapsed times for the program running with 2 and 4 processors, respectively.
For 2 processors, the parallel part of the computation will be completed in half the time, so the elapsed time for the parallel part is 60 / 2 = 30 seconds. The total elapsed time is the sum of the sequential and parallel times: 10 + 30 = 40 seconds. Therefore, the elapsed time for 2 processors is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Consider the representation of six-bit numbers by two's complement, one's complement, or by sign and magnitude. In which representation is there overflow from the addition of the integers 011000 and 011000? Choices: a) Two's complement only b) Sign and magnitude and one's complement only c) Two's complement and one's complement only d) All three representations 
Output:
First, I need to convert the given six-bit numbers to decimal. The binary numbers 011000 and 011000 are equal to 40 in decimal.
Now, I need to add these numbers. The sum of 40 + 40 is 80.
In two's complement, the numbers are represented as the signed magnitude plus the sign bit. The sign bit is 0 for positive numbers, and 1 for negative numbers. Since both numbers are positive, there is no overflow in two's complement representation.
In one's complement, the number is represented as the bitwise complement of the magnitude plus one. Since both numbers are positive, there is no overflow in one's complement representation.
In sign and magnitude, the numbers are represented as the signed magnitude without the sign bit. Since both numbers are positive, there is no overflow in sign and magnitude representation.
Therefore, there is no overflow in any of the representations. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Of the following, which best characterizes computers that use memory-mapped I/O? Choices: a) The computer provides special instructions for manipulating I/O ports. b) I/O ports are placed at addresses on the bus and are accessed just like other memory locations. c) To perform an I/O operation, it is sufficient to place the data in an address register and call the channel to perform the operation. d) Ports are referenced only by memory-mapped instructions of the computer and are located at hardwired memory locations. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the given choices. Memory-mapped I/O refers to a method of handling input/output (I/O) operations in a computer system where I/O devices are treated as memory locations.
a) The computer provides special instructions for manipulating I/O ports, but this is not the best characterization of memory-mapped I/O as it does not describe the treatment of I/O devices as memory locations.
b) I/O ports are placed at addresses on the bus and are accessed just like other memory locations, which is the best characterization of memory-mapped I/O.
c) To perform an I/O operation, it is sufficient to place the data in an address register and call the channel to perform the operation, but this does not describe the treatment of I/O devices as memory locations, so it is not the best characterization of memory-mapped I/O.
d) Ports are referenced only by memory-mapped instructions of the computer and are located at hardwired memory locations, but this statement is not accurate as ports are not located at hardwired memory locations in memory-mapped I/O systems.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Many cryptographic protocols base their security on assumptions about the computational difficulty of integer factorization. Integer factorization serves this purpose because we believe that Choices: a) integer multiplication is a function whose inverse, factorization, remains difficult for a large class of inputs b) P = NP c) even if P = NP, integer factorization is still likely not to be polynomial-time computable d) testing primality is computationally intractable 
Output:
First, I need to understand the question. The question is asking about the difficulty of integer factorization in the context of cryptographic protocols.
Next, I need to identify the correct statement. The correct statement is that integer factorization is believed to be difficult for a large class of inputs.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Which of the following sets of bit strings CANNOT be described with a regular expression? Choices: a) All bit strings whose number of zeros is a multiple of five b) All bit strings starting with a zero and ending with a one c) All bit strings with an even number of zeros d) All bit strings with more ones than zeros 
Output:
First, I need to understand the given regular expressions.
a) This regular expression describes all bit strings whose number of zeros is a multiple of five.
b) This regular expression describes all bit strings starting with a zero and ending with a one.
c) This regular expression describes all bit strings with an even number of zeros.
d) This regular expression describes all bit strings with more ones than zeros.

To determine which of these cannot be described with a regular expression, I will try to find a pattern that contradicts the given regular expressions.

Let's consider the bit string ""01010101"". This bit string has an even number of zeros (2) and an even number of ones (4). However, it does not fit the description of d) All bit strings with more ones than zeros, so it cannot be described by any of the given regular expressions.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Which of the following conditions can be expressed by a Boolean formula in the Boolean variables p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 and the connectives ∧,∨ (without ¬)?
I. At least three of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true.
II. Exactly three of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true.
III. An even number of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true. Choices: a) I only b) II only c) III only d) I and III 
Output:
First, let's consider the number of variables that can be true. Since we are looking for at least three, four, or exactly three variables to be true, we can assume all four variables can be true.
Now, let's consider the conditions:
I. At least three of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true. This can be expressed as (p_1 ∨ p_2 ∨ p_3 ∨ p_4).
II. Exactly three of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true. This can be expressed as (p_1 ∧ ¬p_2 ∧ ¬p_3 ∧ p_4) ∨ (¬p_1 ∧ p_2 ∧ ¬p_3 ∧ p_4) ∨ (¬p_1 ∧ ¬p_2 ∧ p_3 ∧ p_4) ∨ (p_1 ∧ ¬p_2 ∧ p_3 ∧ ¬p_4) ∨ (p_1 ∧ p_2 ∧ ¬p_3 ∧ ¬p_4) ∨ (¬p_1 ∧ p_2 ∧ p_3 ∧ ¬p_4) ∨ (¬p_1 ∧ ¬p_2 ∧ p_3 ∧ p_4).
III. An even number of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true. This cannot be expressed without the ¬ connective, as it requires counting the number of variables that are true and false.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Two alternatives for interconnecting a set of processors with bidirectional links are (1) the fully interconnected network, in which each processor is directly connected to every other processor, and (2) the ring network, in which each processor is connected to two other processors. The worst-case path length for a network is the maximum, over all pairs of nodes in the network, of the minimum length paths (measured in number of links) between the nodes. For each type of interconnection of n processors, a figure of merit can be formed as the product of the number of links required for the network times the worst-case path length connecting any two processors. The ratio of this figure of merit for the fully interconnected network compared to that of the ring network, for even n > 2, is Choices: a) 1/(n^2) b) 1/(n(n-1)) c) 1/n d) (n-1)/n 
Output:
First, I need to find the number of links required for each type of network. For the fully interconnected network, each processor is connected to every other processor, so the number of links is n(n-1)/2. For the ring network, each processor is connected to two other processors, so the number of links is 2n.
Next, I need to find the worst-case path length for each type of network. For the fully interconnected network, the worst-case path length is 1, as any two processors are directly connected. For the ring network, the worst-case path length is n-1, as the path would go around the entire ring.
Now, I need to calculate the figure of merit for each type of network. For the fully interconnected network, the figure of merit is the product of the number of links and the worst-case path length: (n(n-1)/2) * 1. For the ring network, the figure of merit is the product of the number of links and the worst-case path length: 2n * (n-1).
Finally, I need to find the ratio of the figure of merit for the fully interconnected network compared to that of the ring network. The ratio is ((n(n-1)/2) * 1) / (2n * (n-1)):
(n(n-1)) / (4n(n-1)) = 1/(4n)
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For a connected, undirected graph G = (V, E), which of the following must be true?
I. Σ_{v∈V} degree(v) is even.
II. |E| ≥ |V| − 1
III. G has at least one vertex with degree 1. Choices: a) I only b) II only c) III only d) I and II 
Output:
First, I need to understand the given statements.
I. Σ_{v∈V} degree(v) is even means the sum of the degrees of all vertices in the graph is even.
II. |E| ≥ |V| − 1 means the number of edges in the graph is greater than or equal to the number of vertices minus 1.
III. G has at least one vertex with degree 1 means the graph has at least one vertex that is connected to only one other vertex.

Now, let's analyze each statement:

I. This statement is not always true. For example, consider a graph with an odd number of vertices and no loops (each vertex has an odd degree).
II. This statement is true for a connected graph. In a connected graph, every vertex must be connected to at least one other vertex, so there must be at least |V| - 1 edges.
III. This statement is not always true. For example, consider a graph with no vertices of degree 1, such as a complete graph with an even number of vertices.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: In multiprogrammed systems it is advantageous if some programs such as editors and compilers can be shared by several users. Which of the following must be true of multiprogrammed systems in order that a single copy of a program can be shared by several users?
I. The program is a macro.
II. The program is recursive.
III. The program is reentrant. Choices: a) I only b) II only c) III only d) II and III only 
Output:
First, I need to understand the given options. A macro is a preprocessor command that expands into a larger piece of code. Recursive programs call themselves within their own definition. Reentrant programs can be executed by multiple processes or threads at the same time without interfering with each other.
In order for a single copy of a program to be shared by several users, the program must be reentrant. This is because multiple users may be executing the program at the same time, and if the program is not reentrant, it could lead to conflicts and errors.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Which of the following decimal numbers has an exact representation in binary notation? Choices: a) 0.1 b) 0.2 c) 0.3 d) 0.5 
Output:
First, I need to understand that binary notation only represents numbers that can be expressed as a whole number of powers of 2.
a) 0.1 cannot be expressed as a whole number of powers of 2, because it is a fraction of 1/10, which cannot be represented exactly in binary.
b) 0.2 cannot be expressed as a whole number of powers of 2, because it is a fraction of 1/5, which cannot be represented exactly in binary.
c) 0.3 cannot be expressed as a whole number of powers of 2, because it is a fraction that cannot be represented exactly in binary.
d) 0.5 can be expressed as a whole number of powers of 2, because it is 1/2, which can be represented exactly in binary as 1.0.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Function signatures describe the types of the arguments to a function as well as the return value of the function. For instance, the addition function on reals has a signature of
add : real x real -> real
since it takes two real numbers and returns a real number. But, for a language that allows functions as return values, addition could be considered to have the signature
add : real -> (real -> real)
which means that add takes a single real (the first operand) and returns a new function that itself takes a single real (the second operand) and returns a real (the result). This process of reducing a function with multiple arguments to a function with fewer arguments is called currying. Which of the following is correct? Choices: a) Currying can be applied to any function to the point where it has exactly one input argument. b) Currying cannot be applied to functions of more than two arguments. c) Currying cannot be applied to functions that return functions as arguments. d) Currying cannot be applied w functions that haw arguments that are functions. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the concept of currying. Currying is a technique in functional programming where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each with a single argument.
a) Currying can be applied to any function to the point where it has exactly one input argument. This is correct.
b) Currying cannot be applied to functions of more than two arguments. This is not necessarily true, as currying can be applied to functions with any number of arguments.
c) Currying cannot be applied to functions that return functions as arguments. This is not necessarily true, as currying can be applied to such functions, and the returned function can be curried as well.
d) Currying cannot be applied to functions that have arguments that are functions. This is not necessarily true, as currying can be applied to such functions, and the arguments can be curried as well.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Array A contains 256 elements of 4 bytes each. Its first element is stored at physical address 4,096.
Array B contains 512 elements of 4 bytes each. Its first element is stored at physical address 8,192.
Assume that only arrays A and B can be cached in an initially empty, physically addressed, physically tagged, direct-mapped, 2K-byte cache with an 8-byte block size. The following loop is then executed.
for (i = 0; i < 256; i++)
        A[i] = A[i] + B[2*i];
During the execution of the loop, how many bytes will be written to memory if the cache has a write-back policy? Choices: a) 0 b) 256 c) 1024 d) 2000 
Output:
First, I need to understand the cache structure. This cache is physically addressed, physically tagged, and direct-mapped with a 2K-byte capacity and an 8-byte block size.
Next, I need to understand the loop. The loop iterates over the first 256 elements of array A, and for each iteration, it adds the corresponding element of array B (2*i) to the current element of array A.
Now, I need to analyze the cache behavior. Since the cache is direct-mapped, only one block can be in the cache at a time. The first block that will be loaded into the cache is the block containing the first 8 elements of array A, because that's where the first access is made.
When the loop iterates, the cache will evict the first block and load the block containing the elements from 8*i to (8*i+7) of array A, as long as the physical address of the new block is different from the physical address of the first block. This will happen for the first 32 iterations (from i=0 to i=31).
After the 32nd iteration, the cache will again evict the current block and load the block containing the elements from 64*i to (64*i+7) of array A, as long as the physical address of the new block is different from the physical address of the first block or the blocks loaded in the previous 32 iterations. This will happen for the next 32 iterations (from i=32 to i=63).
This pattern will continue until the last iteration (i=255), when the cache will load the block containing the elements from 2048*i to (2048*i+7) of array A.
Since each block contains 8 elements, and each element is 4 bytes, the total number of bytes written to memory is 32*8*4 + 31*8*4 + ... + 1*8*4 = 32*8*4*(32+31+...+1) = 32*8*4*(32*(32+1)/2) = 32*8*4*1680 = 1024*1680 = 1717920 bytes.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: In which of the following representations of numbers by 8-bit words is the addition of the integers 109 and -42 within range?
I. One's complement
II. Two's complement
III. Sign and magnitude Choices: a) I only b) II only c) I and II only d) I, II, and III 
Output:
First, I need to understand the range of 8-bit words. An 8-bit word can represent numbers from 0 to 255 in decimal.

Now, let's check the representations:

I. One's complement: To represent negative numbers, we flip all the bits and add 1. For example, -42 in one's complement would be 1101010 (flip all the bits of 0110101 and add 1). The sum of 109 and -42 in one's complement is 109 + 1101010 = 1101101. This number is within the range of 8-bit words (0 to 255).

II. Two's complement: To represent negative numbers, we flip all the bits and add 1, then add 1 to the result. For example, -42 in two's complement would be 1101011 (flip all the bits of 0110101 and add 1, then add 1 more). The sum of 109 and -42 in two's complement is 109 + 1101011 = 1101100. This number is within the range of 8-bit words (0 to 255).

III. Sign and magnitude: In this representation, the most significant bit (MSB) is used to represent the sign. A 1 in the MSB means the number is negative, and a 0 means the number is positive. The sum of 109 and -42 in sign and magnitude is 109 + (-42) = 67. This number is within the range of 8-bit words (0 to 255).

Since all three representations are within the range, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: If a malicious process is granted temporary administrator-level access to a system Choices: a) the threat is over as soon as the process is killed b) the threat is over after the operating system is rebooted c) the thread is over after rebooting the machine and replacing files that show a virus infection d) the threat is often permanent until the entire disk is wiped clean 
Output:
First, I need to understand the scenario. A malicious process is granted temporary administrator-level access to a system. This means the process has elevated privileges and can perform actions that would normally be restricted.
Next, I need to consider what happens when the process is killed or the system is rebooted. Killing the process may stop the immediate threat, but the malware may have already performed its intended actions or installed itself permanently.
Rebooting the system may stop the process, but it does not necessarily remove the malware from the system. The malware may be designed to reactivate upon system startup.
Replacing files that show a virus infection may not be enough, as the malware may have hidden itself in other parts of the system or created backdoors.
Wiping the entire disk clean is a drastic measure and may not be feasible in all situations. However, it is the most effective way to ensure that all traces of the malware are removed.
Therefore, the threat is often permanent until the entire disk is wiped clean, so the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Which of the following statements about horizontal versus vertical microarchitecture is (are) true?
I. Programs for horizontal architectures require more time steps than those for vertical architectures.
II. Horizontal microinstructions are unencoded.
III. Horizontal microinstructions usually have a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers. Choices: a) I only b) II only c) III only d) II and III only 
Output:
First, I need to understand the differences between horizontal and vertical microarchitecture. Horizontal microarchitecture has multiple instructions in parallel, while vertical microarchitecture has a single instruction at a time.

I. Programs for horizontal architectures require more time steps than those for vertical architectures because horizontal architectures execute multiple instructions simultaneously, but each instruction takes less time. However, the total time for the program can be more due to the parallel execution.
II. Horizontal microinstructions are not necessarily unencoded. They can be encoded, but the encoding scheme may be different from that of vertical microinstructions.
III. Horizontal microinstructions usually have a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers. This is because horizontal microinstructions are designed to perform multiple operations in parallel, and each operation requires a specific operand.

Given the above, let's check the statements:
I. True, but the total time for the program can be more due to parallel execution.
II. False, horizontal microinstructions can be encoded.
III. True, horizontal microinstructions have a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers.

Since statement III is true, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: A ""strictly binary tree"" is a binary tree in which every node that is not a leaf has two children. Suppose that for a class of strictly binary trees there exists c > 0 such that, for any tree in the class, the ratio of the lengths of any two root-to-leaf paths is bounded above by c. Which of the following best characterizes the height h of any tree in this class, where N is the number of nodes in the tree and N > 1 ? Choices: a) h <= log2(N) b) h = 1/c * log2(N) c) h < c log2(N) d) h > c log2(N) 
Output:
First, I need to understand the given condition that the ratio of the lengths of any two root-to-leaf paths is bounded above by c. This means that the longest path from the root to a leaf cannot be more than c times the shortest path from the root to a leaf.

Next, I need to consider the height of a tree, which is the maximum number of edges in any root-to-leaf path. In a strictly binary tree, each node has at most two children, so the height of a tree with N nodes (N > 1) can be thought of as the number of levels in the tree, where each level has at most twice as many nodes as the previous level.

Since the longest path cannot be more than c times the shortest path, the height of the tree must be less than or equal to the number of levels required for the longest path to be c times the number of levels required for the shortest path.

Now, let's think about the number of levels required for the shortest path. The shortest path has one node at each level, so the total number of nodes in the shortest path is N. The number of levels required for the shortest path is N, since each level has one node.

The longest path, on the other hand, has c times as many nodes as the shortest path, so it has c * N nodes. The number of levels required for the longest path is the number of levels required for c * N nodes, which is log2(c * N) because each level has at most twice as many nodes as the previous level.

Since the longest path cannot be more than c times the shortest path, the height of the tree must be less than or equal to the number of levels required for the longest path, which is log2(c * N).

However, the question asks for a characterization of the height h of any tree in this class, where N is the number of nodes in the tree and N > 1. Since the height of the tree depends on both N and c, it cannot be expressed as a simple function of N alone.

Therefore, the correct answer is not any of the given choices. The height h of any tree in this class is a function of both N and c, and cannot be characterized as a simple function of N alone.

Output: {'sol': 'e'}."
"Input: Which of the following sorting algorithms has average-case and worst-case running times of O(n log n)? Choices: a) Bubble sort b) Insertion sort c) Merge sort d) Quicksort 
Output:
First, I need to identify the sorting algorithms that have a running time of O(n log n). This is a common time complexity for sorting algorithms that use a divide-and-conquer approach.
The sorting algorithms that fit this description are:
- Merge sort
- Quicksort

However, to find the answer, I need to check the given choices. The choices are:
- Bubble sort: This algorithm has a worst-case running time of O(n^2), so it's not the answer.
- Insertion sort: This algorithm has a worst-case running time of O(n^2), so it's not the answer.
- Merge sort: This algorithm has an average-case and worst-case running time of O(n log n), so it's the answer.
- Quicksort: This algorithm also has an average-case running time of O(n log n), but its worst-case running time can be O(n^2) if the pivot choice is not good. However, since the question asks for the sorting algorithm with average-case and worst-case running times of O(n log n), the answer is Merge sort.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Consider the following equations concerning a stack module that has the operations Push, Pop, Top, and IsEmpty. Which of the equations does NOT represent the conventional semantics of a stack? Choices: a) IsEmpty(Push(Stack,Elem)) = true b) Pop(Push(Stack,Elem)) = Stack c) Top(Push(Stack,Elem)) = Elem d) IsEmpty(Push(Push(Stack,Elem1),Elem2)) = false 
Output:
First, I need to understand the conventional semantics of a stack. A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.
Now, let's analyze the given equations:
a) IsEmpty(Push(Stack,Elem)) = true: This equation states that pushing an element onto an empty stack makes the stack empty, which is not true in conventional stacks. In a stack, pushing an element onto an empty stack makes the stack no longer empty.
b) Pop(Push(Stack,Elem)) = Stack: This equation states that popping an element from a stack that has been pushed onto with an element returns the original stack, which is not true in conventional stacks. In a stack, popping an element removes it from the top of the stack, so the stack changes.
c) Top(Push(Stack,Elem)) = Elem: This equation states that the top element of a stack that has been pushed onto with an element is the newly pushed element, which is true in conventional stacks.
d) IsEmpty(Push(Push(Stack,Elem1),Elem2)) = false: This equation states that pushing two elements onto an empty stack does not make the stack empty, which is true in conventional stacks.
Therefore, the equation that does NOT represent the conventional semantics of a stack is a) IsEmpty(Push(Stack,Elem)) = true.
Output: {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Assume that any assignment statement can be executed in unit time. If as many identical processors as needed are used, what is the minimum number of time units needed to execute the assignments
A := B + C
B := A - B
C := A * E
D := A/F
E := B - C
F := A + B
with the same result as if the assignments were executed in the order shown? Choices: a) 1 b) 2 c) 3 d) 4 
Output:
First, I need to find the dependencies between the assignments.
A depends on B and C, B depends on A, C depends on A and E, D depends on A, E depends on B and C, and F depends on A and B.
To minimize the time, I will execute the assignments in parallel as much as possible.
I can execute A, C, and D at the same time since they don't depend on each other. After that, I can execute B and E at the same time since they also don't depend on each other. Finally, I can execute F since it depends on A and B, which have already been calculated.
Therefore, the minimum number of time units needed to execute the assignments is {'sol': '2'}."
"Input: Two expressions E and F are said to be unifiable if there are substitutions for the variables of E and F that make the expressions lexically identical. In the following three expressions, only w, x, y, and z are variables.
I. f(w,w)
II. f(x,1)
III. f(y,g(z))
Which pairs of these expressions is (are) pairs of unifiable expressions? Choices: a) (I, II) only b) (I, III) only c) (II, III) only d) (I, II) and (I, III) only 
Output:
First, I need to find a substitution that makes the expressions lexically identical.
For (I, II), a possible substitution is w = x and w = 1, but this is not possible because a variable cannot be assigned a constant. So, (I, II) is not a pair of unifiable expressions.
For (I, III), a possible substitution is w = y and w = g(z), but this is not possible because a variable cannot be assigned a function. So, (I, III) is not a pair of unifiable expressions.
For (II, III), a possible substitution is x = y and x = g(z), but this is not possible because a variable cannot be assigned a function. So, (II, III) is not a pair of unifiable expressions.
For (I, I), a possible substitution is w = x and w = y, but this is not possible because a variable cannot be assigned two different values. So, (I, I) is not a pair of unifiable expressions.
Therefore, none of the given pairs are pairs of unifiable expressions. The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Which of the following instruction-set features is NOT generally considered an obstacle to aggressive pipelining of an integer unit? Choices: a) Condition codes set by every instruction b) Variable-length encoding of instructions c) Instructions requiring widely varying numbers of cycles to execute d) Several different classes (sets) of registers 
Output:
First, I need to identify the instruction-set feature that is generally NOT an obstacle to aggressive pipelining of an integer unit.
a) Condition codes set by every instruction can cause a branch misprediction, which can stall the pipeline. This is an obstacle to aggressive pipelining.
b) Variable-length encoding of instructions can cause a delay in the pipeline due to the need to decode the instruction before it can be executed. This is an obstacle to aggressive pipelining.
c) Instructions requiring widely varying numbers of cycles to execute can cause a delay in the pipeline due to the need to wait for the slower instructions to complete before moving on to the next instruction. This is an obstacle to aggressive pipelining.
d) Several different classes (sets) of registers do not directly affect the pipeline. This is NOT an obstacle to aggressive pipelining.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Let k >= 2. Let L be the set of strings in {0, 1}^* such that x \in L if and only if the number of 0's in x is divisible by k and the number of 1's in x is odd. The minimum number of states in a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that recognizes L is Choices: a) k + 2 b) 2k c) k log k d) k^2 
Output:
First, I need to understand the problem. The DFA is a type of finite automaton that can recognize a regular language. In this case, the language L is defined by the number of 0's and 1's in the strings.

To minimize the number of states in a DFA that recognizes L, I will try to find a pattern or structure in the strings of L. Since the number of 0's in x is divisible by k and the number of 1's in x is odd, I can think of the following states:

1. A state for the empty string (denoted as ε).
2. A state for strings with an odd number of 1's and no 0's (denoted as 1^(odd)).
3. A state for strings with an even number of 1's and no 0's (denoted as 1^(even)).
4. A state for strings with an odd number of 0's and no 1's (denoted as 0^(odd)).
5. A state for strings with an even number of 0's and no 1's (denoted as 0^(even)).
6. A state for strings with an odd number of both 0's and 1's (denoted as 0^(odd)1^(odd)).
7. A state for strings with an even number of both 0's and 1's (denoted as 0^(even)1^(even)).

Now, I will analyze the transitions between these states:

- From ε, I can transition to 1^(odd) or 0^(odd) when reading a 1 or a 0, respectively.
- From 1^(odd), I can transition to 1^(even) when reading a 0, and to 0^(odd)1^(odd) when reading a 1.
- From 1^(even), I can transition to 1^(odd) when reading a 1, and to 0^(even)1^(even) when reading a 0.
- From 0^(odd), I can transition to 0^(even) when reading a 0, and to 1^(odd)0^(odd) when reading a 1.
- From 0^(even), I can transition to 0^(odd) when reading a 1, and to 0^(even)1^(even) when reading a 0.
- From 0^(odd)1^(odd), I can transition to 0^(even) when reading a 0, and to 1^(odd) when reading a 1.
- From 0^(even)1^(even), I can transition to 0^(odd) when reading a 1, and to 1^(even) when reading a 0.

With these transitions, I can construct a DFA with 8 states that recognizes the language L. Therefore, the minimum number of states in a DFA that recognizes L is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Let G = (V, E) be a finite directed acyclic graph with |E| > 0. Which of the following must be true?
I. G has a vertex with no incoming edge.
II. G has a vertex with no outgoing edge.
III. G has an isolated vertex, that is, one with neither an incoming edge nor an outgoing edge. Choices: a) I only b) II only c) III only d) I and II only 
Output:
First, I need to understand the properties of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A DAG has no cycles, meaning that there is no path from a vertex back to itself or to a vertex that has already been visited.

I. G has a vertex with no incoming edge. This is true because a DAG can have vertices with no incoming edges, as there is no requirement that every vertex must have an incoming edge.

II. G has a vertex with no outgoing edge. This is also true because a DAG can have vertices with no outgoing edges, as there is no requirement that every vertex must have an outgoing edge.

III. G has an isolated vertex, that is, one with neither an incoming edge nor an outgoing edge. This is true because a vertex with no incoming or outgoing edges is called an isolated vertex, and it can exist in a DAG.

Now, let's check the given choices:

a) I only: This is not correct because we have seen that II is also true.

b) II only: This is not correct because we have seen that I is also true.

c) III only: This is not correct because we have seen that both I and II are true.

d) I and II only: This is correct because both I and II are true, and III is a subset of both I and II.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Let T be a depth-first search tree of a connected undirected graph G. For each vertex v of T, let pre(v) be the number of nodes visited up to and including v during a preorder traversal of T, and post(v) be the number of nodes visited up to and including v during a postorder traversal of T. The lowest common ancestor of vertices u and v in T is a vertex w of T such that w is an ancestor of both u and v, and no child of w is an ancestor of both u and v. Let (u, v) be an edge in G that is not in T, such that pre(u) < pre(v). Which of the following statements about u and v must be true?
I. post(u) < post(v)
II. u is an ancestor of v in T.
III. If w is the lowest common ancestor of u and v in T, then w = u. Choices: a) I only b) II only c) III only d) II and III 
Output:
First, let's consider the preorder traversal of the tree T. Since pre(u) < pre(v), it means that u is visited before v during the preorder traversal. This implies that u is an ancestor of v in the tree T, so II is true.

Now, let's consider the lowest common ancestor w of u and v in T. Since u is visited before v during the preorder traversal, w cannot be u because w would have been visited before u, which contradicts the definition of the lowest common ancestor (w must be visited after both u and v). Therefore, III is not true.

Finally, let's consider the postorder traversal of the tree T. Since u is an ancestor of v in the tree T, all the nodes visited up to and including u during the postorder traversal are visited before the nodes visited up to and including v. However, this does not necessarily mean that post(u) < post(v), because some nodes visited after u during the postorder traversal might be visited before v. Therefore, I is not necessarily true.

In summary, the only true statement is II: u is an ancestor of v in T. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: In systems with support for automatic memory management, a garbage collector typically has the responsibility for reclaiming allocated memory objects whose contents cannot affect any future legal computation. Such objects are identified by determining that they cannot be reached from a root set. Which of the following is NOT part of the root set in a typical garbage collector? Choices: a) Actual parameters of the active procedures b) Dynamically allocated objects on the heap c) Global variables of the program d) Local variables on the call stack 
Output:
First, I need to understand the root set in a garbage collector. The root set is a set of objects that are directly or indirectly accessible from the program's execution context.
a) Actual parameters of the active procedures are part of the execution context, so they are in the root set.
b) Dynamically allocated objects on the heap are created during the program's execution and can be accessed from the root set.
c) Global variables of the program are part of the program's execution context and can be accessed from the root set.
d) Local variables on the call stack are created during the execution of a procedure and are not part of the program's execution context when the procedure is not active. Therefore, they are NOT part of the root set in a typical garbage collector.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: In the Internet Protocol (IP) suite of protocols, which of the following best describes the purpose of the Address Resolution Protocol? Choices: a) To translate Web addresses to host names b) To determine the IP address of a given host name c) To determine the hardware address of a given host name d) To determine the hardware address of a given IP address 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol used in the Internet Protocol (IP) suite to map IP addresses to physical (hardware) addresses, such as Ethernet MAC addresses.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Which of the following language features requires that stack-based storage allocation be used rather than static allocation? Choices: a) Recursive procedures b) Arbitrary goto's c) Two-dimensional arrays d) Integer-valued functions 
Output:
First, I need to identify the language feature that requires stack-based storage allocation.
a) Recursive procedures often require stack-based storage allocation because each recursive call creates a new instance of the procedure, and the memory for the local variables of that instance must be stored on the stack.
b) Arbitrary goto's do not inherently require stack-based storage allocation.
c) Two-dimensional arrays can be statically allocated, but they can also be dynamically allocated on the heap, which would require stack-based storage allocation if the array is created within a function or procedure.
d) Integer-valued functions do not inherently require stack-based storage allocation.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Which of the following is not a sentence that is generated by the grammar A -> BC, B -> x|Bx, C -> B|D, D -> y|Ey, E -> z? Choices: a) xyz b) xy c) xxzy d) xxxxy 
Output:
First, I need to understand the given grammar. A -> BC means that A can be replaced with BC. B -> x|Bx means that B can be replaced with either x or B followed by x. C -> B|D means that C can be replaced with B or D. D -> y|Ey means that D can be replaced with y or Dy. E -> z means that E can be replaced with z.
Now, I need to check each choice to see if it is generated by the given grammar.
a) xyz: This is not generated by the given grammar because it does not contain any BC sequence.
b) xy: This is not generated by the given grammar because it does not contain any BC sequence.
c) xxzy: This is generated by the given grammar. It can be generated as follows: A -> BC, B -> Bx, C -> B, B -> x, D -> y, E -> z. So, A -> BC -> BxByz.
d) xxxxy: This is generated by the given grammar. It can be generated as follows: A -> BC, B -> Bx, C -> B, B -> x, D -> y, E -> y. So, A -> BC -> BxByy.
Therefore, the choice that is not generated by the given grammar is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Let T (n) be defined by T(1) = 7 and T(n + 1) = 3n + T(n) for all integers n ≥ 1. Which of the following represents the order of growth of T(n) as a function of n? Choices: a) Θ(n) b) Θ(n log n) c) Θ(n^2) d) Θ(n^2 log n) 
Output:
First, I need to find the recurrence relation for T(n) in terms of T(n - 1).
T(n + 1) = 3n + T(n)
T(n) = 3n + T(n - 1)
Now, I need to solve this recurrence relation.
Let S(n) = T(n) - 7n.
S(n + 1) = 3n + S(n)
S(n) = 3(n - 1) + S(n - 1)
Now, I can see that S(n) is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 3.
The sum of a geometric sequence is given by the formula:
S(n) = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)
where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.
In this case, a = S(1) = 0 and r = 3.
S(n) = 0 * (1 - 3^n) / (1 - 3) = -3^n / 2
Now, I need to find the order of growth of T(n).
Since T(n) = 7n + S(n), I can write T(n) as:
T(n) = 7n - 3^n / 2
The order of growth of T(n) is the same as the order of growth of the term with the highest order of growth.
In this case, the term with the highest order of growth is 3^n, which is exponential growth.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Which of the following problems is (are) decidable?
I. Given a (finite) string w, is w a prefix of the decimal expansion of π?
II. Given a program and an input, is the program’s output the decimal expansion of π?
III. Given a program that takes as input a prefix of the decimal expansion of π, is the program’s output always the same for every prefix? Choices: a) I only b) II only c) III only d) I and II only 
Output:
First, I need to understand what decidable means in this context. A problem is decidable if there exists an algorithm that can always determine whether a given input belongs to the solution set or not.

I. Given a (finite) string w, is w a prefix of the decimal expansion of π? This problem is decidable because we can check if w is a prefix of the known decimal expansion of π. If w is a prefix of the known decimal expansion, then it belongs to the solution set. If w is not a prefix of the known decimal expansion, then it does not belong to the solution set.

II. Given a program and an input, is the program’s output the decimal expansion of π? This problem is not decidable because we cannot know if a program will always output the decimal expansion of π for every possible input. There might be an infinite number of programs that could output the decimal expansion of π, and we cannot check them all.

III. Given a program that takes as input a prefix of the decimal expansion of π, is the program’s output always the same for every prefix? This problem is not decidable because we cannot know if a program will always output the same result for every prefix of the decimal expansion of π. There might be an infinite number of prefixes, and we cannot check them all to see if the program’s output is always the same.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Which of the following statements about circuits is (are) true?
I. Combinational circuits may have feedback; sequential circuits do not.
II. Combinational circuits have a ""memoryless"" property; sequential circuits do not.
III. Both sequential and combinational circuits must be controlled by an external clock. Choices: a) I only b) II only c) I and II only d) II and III only 
Output:
First, I need to understand the properties of combinational and sequential circuits.
Combinational circuits are logic circuits that perform a mathematical operation on their inputs to produce an output. They do not have any memory of previous inputs or outputs, hence they are ""memoryless"".
Sequential circuits, on the other hand, have memory because they can store information in the form of states. They can have feedback, but this feedback is controlled by a clock signal.
Now, let's compare the statements:
I. Combinational circuits may have feedback; sequential circuits do not. This statement is false because sequential circuits can have feedback.
II. Combinational circuits have a ""memoryless"" property; sequential circuits do not. This statement is true because combinational circuits are memoryless, but sequential circuits do have memory.
III. Both sequential and combinational circuits must be controlled by an external clock. This statement is false because combinational circuits do not require a clock signal to operate.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Two single-user workstations are attached to the same local area network. On one of these workstations, file pages are accessed over the network from a file server; the average access time per page is 0.1 second. On the other of these workstations, file pages are accessed from a local disk; the average access time per page is 0.05 second. A particular compilation requires 30 seconds of computation and 200 file page accesses. What is the ratio of the total time required by this compilation if run on the diskless (file server) workstation to the total time required if run on the workstation with the local disk, if it is assumed that computation is not overlapped with file access? Choices: a) 1/1 b) 5/4 c) 5/3 d) 10/5 
Output:
First, I need to calculate the total time required for file accesses on both workstations. For the diskless workstation, the total time is 0.1 second * 200 = 20 seconds.
For the workstation with the local disk, the total time is 0.05 second * 200 = 10 seconds.
Next, I need to calculate the total time required for computation on both workstations, which is 30 seconds for both.
Now, I need to add the total time for file accesses and computation for both workstations:
For the diskless workstation: 20 seconds (file access) + 30 seconds (computation) = 50 seconds.
For the workstation with the local disk: 10 seconds (file access) + 30 seconds (computation) = 40 seconds.
Finally, I need to find the ratio of the total time required by the compilation if run on the diskless workstation to the total time required if run on the workstation with the local disk: 50 seconds ÷ 40 seconds = 5/4.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Assume that a debugger places a breakpoint at a load instruction at virtual address 0x77E81234 (hexadecimal notation) in a debugged process P. If the text segment of P begins at 0x77E80000 in P’s virtual address space and if the debugger has mapped this same text segment at 0x01000000 in its virtual address space, which of the following is the virtual address used by the debugger in its WRITE operation, along with a description of how the debugger has mapped the virtual memory page containing this address? Choices: a) 0x01001234; page mapped with READ/WRITE access b) 0x01001234; page mapped with COPY-ON-WRITE access c) 0x76E81234; page mapped with READ/WRITE access d) 0x76E81234; page mapped with COPY-ON-WRITE access 
Output:
First, I need to find the virtual address used by the debugger. Since the debugger has mapped the text segment of P at 0x01000000 in its virtual address space, I add the offset (0x1234) to the base address (0x01000000) to get the virtual address used by the debugger: 0x01000000 + 0x1234 = 0x01001234.
Next, I need to determine the access type of the page containing this address. Since the debugger is a read-only debugger, it typically maps the text segment with READ-ONLY access. However, since it is a debugger, it may also map the page with COPY-ON-WRITE access to allow the debugger to modify the memory without affecting the original process. But in this case, the question does not specify that the debugger is a write-debugging debugger, so it is more likely that the page is mapped with READ/WRITE access. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Which of the following considerations applies (apply) to choosing the page size in a paging system?
I. An advantage of larger pages is that they lead to smaller page tables.
II. An advantage of smaller pages is that they lead to less waste due to internal fragmentation.
III. Normally, the dominant factor in disk access time is not dependent on page length, so longer pages can be used advantageously. Choices: a) I only b) II only c) I and III only d) I, II, and III 
Output:
First, I need to consider the advantages of larger and smaller pages. Larger pages lead to smaller page tables, which can be an advantage because smaller page tables require less memory. Smaller pages lead to less waste due to internal fragmentation, which can be an advantage because less wasted space means more efficient use of memory.
Next, I need to consider the factor of disk access time. Normally, the dominant factor in disk access time is not dependent on page length. This means that longer pages can be used advantageously because they can reduce the number of disk accesses, which can improve performance.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Two processors, M-5 and M-7, implement the same instruction set. Processor M-5 uses a 5-stage pipeline and a clock cycle of 10 nanoseconds. Processor M-7 uses a 7-stage pipeline and a clock cycle of 7.5 nanoseconds. Which of the following is (are) true?
I. M-7’s pipeline has better maximum throughput than M-5’s pipeline.
II. The latency of a single instruction is shorter on M-7’s pipeline than on M-5’s pipeline.
III. Programs executing on M-7 will always run faster than programs executing on M-5. Choices: a) I only b) II only c) I and III d) II and III 
Output:
First, I need to compare the maximum throughput of the processors. The maximum throughput is the number of instructions that can be executed per second. To calculate this, I divide the clock cycle by the number of stages in the pipeline: M-5 has a clock cycle of 10 nanoseconds and a 5-stage pipeline, so its maximum throughput is 1/10 ns ÷ 5 = 0.1 instructions per nanosecond (or 100 instructions per second). M-7 has a clock cycle of 7.5 nanoseconds and a 7-stage pipeline, so its maximum throughput is 1/7.5 ns ÷ 7 = 0.133 instructions per nanosecond (or 133 instructions per second). Therefore, M-7 has a better maximum throughput than M-5.
Next, I need to compare the latency of a single instruction. The latency is the time it takes for an instruction to complete from the moment it is issued until it is completed. In a pipeline, the latency is the number of stages multiplied by the clock cycle. M-5 has a latency of 5 * 10 ns = 50 nanoseconds. M-7 has a latency of 7 * 7.5 ns = 52.5 nanoseconds. Therefore, the latency of a single instruction is shorter on M-5’s pipeline than on M-7’s pipeline.
Finally, I need to compare the running time of programs on the two processors. The running time of a program depends on the number of instructions it contains and the latency of each instruction. Since M-7 has a shorter latency for each instruction, it will execute the program faster than M-5, assuming the program has the same number of instructions. However, if the program has more instructions on M-7 than on M-5, it may take longer to execute on M-7 due to its higher maximum throughput.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Which of the following pairs of 8-bit, two's-complement numbers will result in overflow when the members of the pairs are added? Choices: a) 11111111, 00000001 b) 00000001, 10000000 c) 11111111, 10000001 d) 10000001, 10101010 
Output:
First, I need to check if the addition of the two numbers will result in a value greater than the maximum possible value for an 8-bit, two's-complement number, which is 11111111 in binary or 255 in decimal.
a) 11111111 + 00000001 = 11111111 + 1 = 10000000 (which is less than 11111111, so there is no overflow)
b) 00000001 + 10000000 = 10000001 (which is less than 11111111, so there is no overflow)
c) 11111111 + 10000001 = 100000110 (which is greater than 11111111, so there is overflow)
d) 10000001 + 10101010 = 101010111 (which is less than 11111111, so there is no overflow)
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Two computers communicate with each other by sending data packets across a local area network. The size of these packets is 1,000 bytes. The network has the capacity to carry 1,000 packets per second. The CPU time required to execute the network protocol to send one packet is 10 milliseconds. The maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another is approximately Choices: a) 10,000 bytes/second b) 25,000 bytes/ second c) 100,000 bytes/ second d) 500,000 bytes/ second 
Output:
First, I need to calculate the number of packets that can be sent per second. The network has the capacity to carry 1,000 packets per second.
Next, I need to calculate the size of one packet in seconds. The size of one packet is 1,000 bytes and the CPU time required to execute the network protocol to send one packet is 10 milliseconds, which is equal to 0.01 seconds.
To find the maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another, I divide the number of packets that can be sent per second by the size of one packet in seconds: 1,000 packets ÷ 0.01 seconds = 100,000 bytes/second.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Consider the following grammar.
S → ( S )
S → x
Which of the following statements is (are) true?
I. The grammar is ambiguous.
II. The grammar is suitable for top-down parsing.
III. The grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing. Choices: a) I only b) II only c) III only d) II and III only 
Output:
First, I need to check if the grammar is ambiguous. An ambiguous grammar has more than one possible parse tree for a given string.
In this case, the grammar has only two rules: S → ( S ) and S → x. There is no rule for combining x and ( S ).
If I give the string S, it can be parsed as S → ( S ) or S → x. However, if I give the string ( S ), it can only be parsed as S → ( S ).
Since there is only one possible parse tree for ( S ), the grammar is not ambiguous.
Next, I need to check if the grammar is suitable for top-down parsing. Top-down parsing starts at the top symbol (S) and works its way down to the terminal symbols (x).
In this case, the grammar has a rule for S that can be applied recursively, which is suitable for top-down parsing.
Finally, I need to check if the grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing. Bottom-up parsing starts with the terminal symbols and works its way up to the top symbol (S).
In this case, the grammar has no rules for combining x and ( S ), which makes it unsuitable for bottom-up parsing.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Hash tables can contribute to an efficient average-case solution for all of the problems described below EXCEPT: Choices: a) Counting distinct values: Given a set of n keys, determine the number of distinct key values. b) Dynamic dictionary: Support the operations of insert, delete, and search in a dictionary. c) Range search: Given values a and b, find all the records whose key value is in the range a, b. d) Symbol table lookup: Given a program identifier, find its type and address. 
Output:
First, I need to consider each problem and determine if hash tables can contribute to an efficient average-case solution.
a) Counting distinct values: Hash tables can be used to efficiently count the number of distinct key values in the average case.
b) Dynamic dictionary: Hash tables are used to support the operations of insert, delete, and search in a dictionary, making them an efficient solution for this problem.
c) Range search: Hash tables can be used to efficiently perform range searches in the average case, as long as the range is not too large.
d) Symbol table lookup: Hash tables can be used to efficiently perform symbol table lookups, as they allow for fast key-value lookups.
Therefore, the problem that hash tables cannot contribute to an efficient average-case solution is 'Symbol table lookup', as it is not one of the problems listed.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Let A be a finite set with m elements, and let B be a finite set with n elements. The number of distinct functions mapping A into B is Choices: a) n^m b) n!/(n - m)! c) n! d) n!/(m!(n - m)!) 
Output:
First, I need to understand the problem. A function is a rule that assigns to each element of A exactly one element of B. The number of ways to choose an element from B for each element of A is n for each element of A, so the total number of ways to choose elements from B for all elements of A is n * m.
However, since the function is one-to-one, meaning no two elements of A can be mapped to the same element of B, I need to divide by the number of ways to choose m elements from n, which is n!/(n - m)!.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: To compute the matrix product M_1M_2, where M_1 has p rows and q columns and where M_2 has q rows and r columns, takes time proportional to pqr, and the result is a matrix of p rows and r columns. Consider the product of three matrices N_1N_2N_3 that have, respectively, w rows and x columns, x rows and y columns, and y rows and z columns. Under what condition will it take less time to compute the product as (N_1N_2)N_3 (i.e., multiply the first two matrices first) than to compute it as N_1(N_2 N_3)? Choices: a) There is no such condition; i.e., they will always take the same time. b) 1/x + 1/z < 1/w + 1/y c) x > y d) 1/w + 1/x < 1/y + 1/z 
Output:
First, I need to consider the time complexity of multiplying two matrices. As mentioned in the question, it takes time proportional to the product of the number of rows of the first matrix and the number of columns of the second matrix.
Next, I need to consider the time complexity of multiplying three matrices. To do this, I can break it down into two steps: first, multiply the first two matrices, and then multiply the result with the third matrix. The time complexity of the first step is proportional to the product of the number of rows of the first matrix and the number of columns of the second matrix, which is w*x. The time complexity of the second step is proportional to the product of the number of columns of the first matrix and the number of rows of the third matrix, which is x*z. The total time complexity for the three-matrix multiplication is therefore w*x*z.
Now, I need to compare this with the time complexity of multiplying the matrices in the order N_1(N_2 N_3). In this case, the time complexity is proportional to the product of the number of rows of the first matrix and the number of columns of the resulting matrix, which is w*z.
To determine under what condition it takes less time to compute the product as (N_1N_2)N_3 than to compute it as N_1(N_2 N_3), I need to compare w*x*z with w*z. To do this, I can rearrange the inequality as w*x*z > w*z, which simplifies to x*z > z. Therefore, the condition is x > 1.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: The hit ratio of a cache memory is the percentage of accesses (reads and writes) for which data are found in the cache. Write-through is a policy whereby every write operation updates main memory. Write-back is a policy whereby a write operation to a line found in the cache does not affect main memory until the line is evicted from the cache. Write-allocation is a policy whereby a cache line is allocated and loaded on a write-miss. If it is assumed that write-allocation is always used, which of the following is true? Choices: a) Write-back usually results in a better hit ratio than write-through. b) Write-through usually results in a better hit ratio than write-back. c) The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-back than for write-through. d) The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for writethrough than for write-back. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the given assumptions. Write-allocation means that a cache line is always loaded when a write-miss occurs. This means that both write-through and write-back policies will always load the cache line when a write-miss occurs.
Next, I need to understand the difference between write-through and write-back. Write-through updates main memory immediately when a write operation is performed, while write-back updates main memory only when the line is evicted from the cache.
Now, I need to consider the hit ratio. A hit occurs when the data is found in the cache, and a miss occurs when the data is not found in the cache. In the case of a write-miss, both write-through and write-back will load the cache line, so the hit ratio for a write-miss will be the same for both policies.
However, for a read-miss, write-through will always result in a main memory operation because it updates main memory immediately when a write operation is performed. On the other hand, write-back will not result in a main memory operation for a read-miss because it does not update main memory until the line is evicted from the cache. Therefore, the percentage of read operations resulting in a main memory operation will be larger for write-through than for write-back.
Since write operations are not considered in the hit ratio calculation, the percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will not affect the hit ratio.
Therefore, the correct answer is d) The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-through than for write-back.

Therefore, the percentage of read operations resulting in a main memory operation will be larger for write-through than for write-back.
Since write operations are not considered in the hit ratio calculation, the percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will not affect the hit ratio.
Therefore, the correct answer is d) The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-through than for write-back.

Output:
First, I need to understand the given assumptions. Write-allocation means that a cache line is always loaded when a write-miss occurs. This means that both write-through and write-back policies will always load the cache line when a write-miss occurs.
Next, I need to understand the difference between write-through and write-back. Write-through updates main memory immediately when a write operation is performed, while write-back updates main memory only when the line is evicted from the cache.
Now, I need to consider the hit ratio. A hit occurs when the data is found in the cache, and a miss occurs when the data is not found in the cache. In the case of a write-miss, both write-through and write-back will load the cache line, so the hit ratio for a write-miss will be the same for both policies.
However, for a read-miss, write-through will always result in a main memory operation because it updates main memory immediately when a write operation is performed. On the other hand, write-back will not result in a main memory operation for a read-miss because it does not update main memory until the line is evicted from the cache. Therefore, the percentage of read operations resulting in a"
"Input: A particular disk unit uses a bit string to record the occupancy or vacancy of its tracks, with O denoting vacant and 1 denoting occupied. A 32-bit segment of this string has the hexadecimal value D4FE2003. The percentage of occupied tracks for the corresponding part of the disk, to the nearest percent, is Choices: a) 12% b) 25% c) 38% d) 44% 
Output:
First, I need to convert the hexadecimal value to binary. D4FE2003 in hexadecimal is 11010100 11111111 11111110 11100000 00101000 00000011 in binary.
Next, I count the number of 1s in the binary string, which represents the number of occupied tracks. There are 11 1s in the binary string.
Now, I need to find the percentage of occupied tracks. To do this, I divide the number of occupied tracks by the total number of tracks in the 32-bit segment (since each bit represents a track, there are 32 tracks in total). The percentage of occupied tracks is 11 / 32 = 0.34375.
Finally, I round the percentage to the nearest percent, which is 34.375%. However, since the question asks for the answer to the nearest percent, I round it to 34%.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: An Euler circuit of an undirected graph is a circuit in which each edge of the graph appears exactly once. Which of the following undirected graphs must have an Euler circuit?
I. A complete graph with 12 vertices
II. A complete graph with 13 vertices
III. A tree with 13 vertices Choices: a) I only b) II only c) III only d) I and II 
Output:
First, I need to understand the properties of an Euler circuit. An Euler circuit exists in a graph if and only if the graph is connected and every vertex has an even degree.
I. A complete graph with 12 vertices has 12 * 11 / 2 = 66 edges. Since 12 is an even number, all vertices have an even degree. However, the graph is not necessarily connected, so it may not have an Euler circuit.
II. A complete graph with 13 vertices has 13 * 12 / 2 = 78 edges. Since 13 is an odd number, one vertex has an odd degree, and the graph does not have an Euler circuit.
III. A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. Since a tree has no cycles, it does not have any edges that appear more than once. Therefore, a tree with 13 vertices has an Euler circuit if and only if all its vertices have even degree. However, since 13 is an odd number, one vertex must have an odd degree, and the tree does not have an Euler circuit.
Therefore, none of the options (I, II, III) have an Euler circuit. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Which of the following characteristics of a programming language is best specified using a context-free grammar? Choices: a) Identifier length b) Maximum level of nesting c) Operator precedence d) Type compatibility 
Output:
First, I need to understand the characteristics of a programming language.
a) Identifier length is a lexical characteristic, which is not best specified using a context-free grammar. It is usually specified by a lexer or scanner.
b) Maximum level of nesting is a syntactic characteristic, which can be best specified using a context-free grammar. It defines the structure of the program and the number of nested structures allowed.
c) Operator precedence is a semantic characteristic, which is not best specified using a context-free grammar. It is usually specified by a parser or a BNF (Backus-Naur Form) grammar.
d) Type compatibility is a semantic characteristic, which is not best specified using a context-free grammar. It is usually specified by a type system or a type checker.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Which of the following statements about datagrams sent by a node in a network using IPv4 protocol is (are) true?
I. Datagrams at the source must be the size of the smallest maximum transmission unit (MTU) of all the links on a path to the destination.
II. Datagrams may be fragmented during routing.
III. Datagrams are reassembled only at the destination. Choices: a) I only b) II only c) III only d) II and III 
Output:
First, I need to understand the statements about datagrams sent by a node in a network using IPv4 protocol.
I. The statement is not necessarily true because the source node does not know the MTU of all the links on a path to the destination.
II. The statement is true because datagrams may be fragmented during routing if they are larger than the MTU of a link on the path.
III. The statement is true because datagrams are reassembled only at the destination.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A starvation-free job-scheduling policy guarantees that no job waits indefinitely for service. Which of the following job-scheduling policies is starvation-free? Choices: a) Round-robin b) Priority queuing c) Shortest job first d) Youngest job first 
Output:
First, I need to understand the given options. Round-robin, Priority queuing, Shortest job first, and Youngest job first are all job-scheduling policies.
Next, I need to determine which of these policies guarantees that no job waits indefinitely for service.
In Round-robin, jobs are given a fixed time slice, so it's possible for a job to be preempted before it finishes, causing it to wait for its next time slice.
In Priority queuing, jobs with higher priority are served before jobs with lower priority, but a job with the lowest priority may still wait indefinitely if no higher-priority jobs are available.
In Shortest job first, jobs are served in the order of their length, so the shortest job will be served first. If a longer job arrives after a shorter one, the shorter job will be completed before the longer one starts, so no job waits indefinitely for service.
In Youngest job first, jobs are served in the order they arrived, so if a job arrives after another job, it will wait for that job to finish before it starts. However, since jobs are served in the order they arrived, no job waits indefinitely for service.
Therefore, both Shortest job first and Youngest job first are starvation-free. However, the question asks for only one answer, so the correct answer is {'sol': 'a' for Round-robin, 'b' for Priority queuing, 'c' for Shortest job first, 'd' for Youngest job first, but since the question asks for only one answer, the correct answer is 'c' for Shortest job first}."
"Input: Of the following, which gives the best upper bound for the value of f(N) where f is a solution to the recurrence f(2N + 1) = f(2N) = f(N) + log N for N >= 1, with f(1) = 0? Choices: a) O(log N) b) O(N log N) c) O(log N) + 0(1) d) O((log N)^2) 
Output:
First, I need to find a pattern in the recurrence relation. Since f(2N + 1) = f(2N) = f(N), it seems that the function value doesn't change when N is even. So, I can focus on the case when N is odd.
For N = 1, f(1) = 0, which is the base case.
For N = 3, f(3) = f(2) = f(1) + log 2 = 0 + log 2 = log 2.
For N = 5, f(5) = f(4) = f(2) + log 4 = log 2 + log 4 = 2 * log 2.
For N = 7, f(7) = f(6) = f(3) + log 6 = log 2 + log 3 + log 6 = 3 * log 2 + log 3.
I see that the function value increases by a multiple of log 2 for each step, and the log term of the largest number encountered so far is added.
Since the largest number encountered is 7, the log term is log 7.
The function value for N = 7 is 3 * log 2 + log 7.
Since the function value increases by a multiple of log 2 for each step, the best upper bound for the value of f(N) is O((log N) * log N) = O(N log N).
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Company X shipped 5 computer chips, 1 of which was defective, and Company Y shipped 4 computer chips, 2 of which were defective. One computer chip is to be chosen uniformly at random from the 9 chips shipped by the companies. If the chosen chip is found to be defective, what is the probability that the chip came from Company Y? Choices: a) 2 / 9 b) 4 / 9 c) 1 / 2 d) 2 / 3 
Output:
First, I need to find the total number of defective chips and the number of defective chips from Company Y. There are 1 defective chip from Company X and 2 defective chips from Company Y, so the total number of defective chips is 1 + 2 = 3.
Next, I need to find the number of chips from Company Y. There are 4 chips from Company Y.
Now, I need to find the number of defective chips from Company Y, which is 2.
To find the probability that a chip chosen at random is defective and from Company Y, I divide the number of defective chips from Company Y by the total number of chips from Company Y: 2 / 4 = 1 / 2.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Which of the following problems can be solved by a standard greedy algorithm?
I. Finding a minimum spanning tree in an undirected graph with positive-integer edge weights
II. Finding a maximum clique in an undirected graph
III. Finding a maximum flow from a source node to a sink node in a directed graph with positive-integer edge capacities Choices: a) I only b) II only c) III only d) I and II only 
Output:
First, I need to understand what a greedy algorithm is. A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that makes the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.
Now, let's look at each problem:
I. Finding a minimum spanning tree in an undirected graph with positive-integer edge weights can be solved by a greedy algorithm, such as Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm.
II. Finding a maximum clique in an undirected graph is not typically solved by a greedy algorithm. Instead, it is often solved using a brute force approach or more advanced algorithms like the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm.
III. Finding a maximum flow from a source node to a sink node in a directed graph with positive-integer edge capacities can be solved by a greedy algorithm, such as the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: A program that checks spelling works in the following way. A hash table has been defined in which each entry is a Boolean variable initialized to false. A hash function has been applied to each word in the dictionary, and the appropriate entry in the hash table has been set to true. To check the spelling in a document, the hash function is applied to every word in the document, and the appropriate entry in the hash table is examined. Which of the following is (are) correct?
I. true means the word was in the dictionary.
II. false means the word was not in the dictionary.
III. Hash table size should increase with document size. Choices: a) I only b) II only c) I and II only d) II and III only 
Output:
First, I need to understand the process of the spelling checker. When a word is in the dictionary, its corresponding entry in the hash table is set to true. When a word is not in the dictionary, its corresponding entry in the hash table is set to false.
Now, I can answer the question.
I. true means the word was in the dictionary, because if the entry is true, it means the word was in the dictionary.
II. false means the word was not in the dictionary, because if the entry is false, it means the word was not in the dictionary.
III. Hash table size does not necessarily increase with document size. The size of the hash table is determined beforehand and does not change during the spelling check process.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: One approach to handling fuzzy logic data might be to design a computer using ternary (base-3) logic so that data could be stored as “true,” “false,” and “unknown.” If each ternary logic element is called a flit, how many flits are required to represent at least 256 different values? Choices: a) 4 b) 5 c) 6 d) 7 
Output:
First, I need to find the number of unique values that can be represented using ternary logic. Since there are three possible values (true, false, and unknown), I can use the formula for the number of unique values in a base-n system: n^x, where x is the number of digits.
In this case, I want to represent at least 256 different values, so I need to find the smallest x such that 3^x >= 256.
I can start by testing x = 1 (3^1 = 3), x = 2 (3^2 = 9), x = 3 (3^3 = 27), x = 4 (3^4 = 81), and x = 5 (3^5 = 243).
Since 256 is greater than 243, I need at least 6 flits to represent at least 256 different values. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Local caching of files is common in distributed file systems, but it has the disadvantage that Choices: a) Temporary inconsistencies among views of a file by different machines can result b) The file system is likely to be corrupted when a computer crashes c) A much higher amount of network traffic results d) Caching makes file migration impossible 
Output:
First, I need to understand the question. The question is asking about the disadvantages of local caching of files in distributed file systems.
a) Temporary inconsistencies among views of a file by different machines can result. This is a correct answer because when different machines have different versions of the same file, it can lead to temporary inconsistencies.
b) The file system is likely to be corrupted when a computer crashes is not a correct answer because the file system is not located on a single computer, it is distributed across multiple computers.
c) A much higher amount of network traffic results is not a correct answer because caching reduces network traffic by storing frequently accessed files locally.
d) Caching makes file migration impossible is not a correct answer because caching does not prevent file migration, it only makes it faster by storing frequently accessed files locally.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Array A contains 256 elements of 4 bytes each. Its first element is stored at physical address 4,096.
Array B contains 512 elements of 4 bytes each. Its first element is stored at physical address 8,192.
Assume that only arrays A and B can be cached in an initially empty, physically addressed, physically tagged, direct-mapped, 2K-byte cache with an 8-byte block size. The following loop is then executed.
for (i = 0; i < 256; i++)
        A[i] = A[i] + B[2*i];
During the execution of the loop, how many bytes will be written to memory if the cache has a write-through policy? Choices: a) 0 b) 256 c) 1024 d) 2048 
Output:
First, I need to understand the cache configuration. The cache is physically addressed, physically tagged, and direct-mapped with a 2K-byte capacity and an 8-byte block size.
Next, I need to understand the cache behavior with a write-through policy. With this policy, each write operation will also be written to memory.
Now, I need to analyze the loop. The loop iterates over the first 256 elements of array A, and for each iteration, it adds the corresponding element from array B (2*i).
Since the cache is direct-mapped, only one block can be cached at a time. The first time the loop is executed, the block containing A[0] will be cached. The next time, since the index (i) is even, the block containing B[0] will be evicted from the cache, and the block containing A[2] will be cached. This pattern continues, with the cache containing either A or B, but never both.
Therefore, the cache will contain 256 blocks (one for each element of A), and each block will be written to memory once (due to the write-through policy). Since each block is 8 bytes, the total number of bytes written to memory is 256 * 8 = 2048 bytes.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: At time 0, five jobs are available for execution on a single processor, with service times of 25, 15, 5, 3, and 2 time units. Which of the following is the minimum value of the average completion time of these jobs? Choices: a) 50 b) 208/5 c) 92/5 d) 10 
Output:
First, I need to sort the jobs by their service times in ascending order: 2, 3, 5, 15, 25.
Next, I will simulate the execution of the jobs on the single processor. Since the jobs are sorted, I can execute them one by one, starting with the job with the shortest service time.
At time 0, I start executing the job with a service time of 2 time units. At time 2, the first job finishes.
At time 2, I start executing the job with a service time of 3 time units. At time 5, the second job finishes.
At time 5, I start executing the job with a service time of 5 time units. At time 8, the third job finishes.
At time 8, I start executing the job with a service time of 15 time units. At time 23, the fourth job finishes.
At time 23, I start executing the job with a service time of 25 time units. At time 48, the fifth and last job finishes.
Now, I need to calculate the average completion time of the jobs. The average completion time is the total completion time of all jobs divided by the number of jobs. The total completion time is the sum of the completion times of all jobs, which is 48 + 23 + 8 + 5 + 2 = 86 time units.
The number of jobs is 5.
Therefore, the average completion time is 86 ÷ 5 = 17.2 time units.
Since the choices do not include 17.2, I will round the average completion time to the nearest multiple of 5, which is 17.
However, the choices do not include 17 either. I will round the average completion time to the nearest multiple of 10, which is 20.
The choices do not include 20 either. I will round the average completion time to the nearest multiple of 50, which is 50.

"Input: Let G = (V, E) be a connected, undirected graph, and let a and b be two distinct vertices in V. Let P_1 be the problem of finding a shortest simple path between a and b, and let P_2 be the problem of finding a longest simple path between a and b. Which of the following statements about P_1 and P_2 is true? Choices: a) Both P_1 and P_2 can be solved in polynomial time. b) P_1 can be solved in polynomial time but P_2 is not known to be solvable in polynomial time. c) P_1 is not known to be solvable in polynomial time but P_2 can be solved in polynomial time. d) It is not known whether either P_1 or P_2 can be solved in polynomial time. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the problem. P_1 is the problem of finding a shortest simple path between two vertices, and P_2 is the problem of finding a longest simple path between the same two vertices.

In a connected graph, both the shortest and longest paths between two vertices exist. The shortest path can be found using Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford algorithm, which run in polynomial time. However, finding the longest path is not as straightforward.

The Longest Path problem can be solved in polynomial time for some special cases, such as for a tree or for a series-parallel graph. But in general, the Longest Path problem is NP-hard, meaning that it is not known to be solvable in polynomial time.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: A major advantage of direct mapping of a cache is its simplicity. The main disadvantage of this organization is that Choices: a) it does not allow simultaneous access to the intended data and its tag b) it is more expensive than other types of cache organizations c) the cache hit ratio is degraded if two or more blocks used alternately map onto the same block frame in the cache d) its access time is greater than that of other cache organizations 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main disadvantage of direct mapping in a cache. Direct mapping is simple and fast, but it has a limitation when it comes to handling multiple blocks.
The limitation is that if two or more blocks used alternately map onto the same block frame in the cache, the cache hit ratio is degraded. This is because the cache will evict one block to make room for the other, leading to more cache misses.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Let M be a single-tape, deterministic Turing machine with tape alphabet {blank,0,1}, and let C denote the (possibly infinite) computation of M starting with a blank tape. The input to each problem below is M, together with a positive integer n. Which of the following problems is (are) decidable?
I. The computation C lasts for at least n steps.
II. The computation C lasts for at least n steps, and M prints a 1 at some point after the nth step.
III. M scans at least n distinct tape squares during the computation C. Choices: a) None b) III only c) I and II only d) I and III only 
Output:
First, I need to understand the problem. A Turing machine is a theoretical model of a computer that can be designed to solve any algorithmic problem. It has a tape that can be infinite in both directions, a read/write head that can read and write symbols from the tape, and a set of states that determine the machine's behavior.

The problem asks which of the three given properties is (are) decidable for a given Turing machine M and a positive integer n. A property is decidable if there is an algorithm that can always determine whether a given Turing machine M and a given positive integer n satisfy the property.

Let's analyze each property:

I. The computation C lasts for at least n steps. This property is decidable because we can simulate the Turing machine M and count the number of steps it takes to reach at least n steps. If the number of steps reaches n, then the property is true. If not, the property is false.

II. The computation C lasts for at least n steps, and M prints a 1 at some point after the nth step. This property is not necessarily decidable because even though we can simulate the Turing machine M and count the number of steps, we cannot predict whether M will print a 1 at some point after the nth step without knowing the specific behavior of M.

III. M scans at least n distinct tape squares during the computation C. This property is decidable because we can simulate the Turing machine M and keep track of the squares that the read/write head scans. If the number of distinct squares scanned reaches n, then the property is true. If not, the property is false.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 3-way, set-associative cache is Choices: a) one in which each main memory word can be stored at any of 3 cache locations b) effective only if 3 or fewer processes are running alternately on the processor c) possible only with write-back d) faster to access than a direct-mapped cache 
Output:
First, I need to understand the given choices.
a) one in which each main memory word can be stored at any of 3 cache locations - This is a set-associative cache.
b) effective only if 3 or fewer processes are running alternately on the processor - This is not related to the definition of a set-associative cache.
c) possible only with write-back - This is a feature of a cache, but it is not related to the definition of a set-associative cache.
d) faster to access than a direct-mapped cache - This is not necessarily true. The access time depends on the cache size, associativity, and replacement policy, among other factors.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Consider an object-oriented language in which all entities are objects. Two relationships arise: (1) the instance relationship, between an object and the class of which that object is a member, and (2) the subclass relationship, between a class and the superclass from which that class inherits properties. In such a language, when a message is sent to an object requesting execution of one of its methods (procedures), the method is located by following Choices: a) one instance link and then zero or more subclass links b) one or more instance links and then one or more subclass links c) one or more instance links d) one subclass link and then one or more instance links 
Output:
First, I need to understand the process of method lookup in an object-oriented language. When a message is sent to an object, the method is located by searching for the method in the object itself, then in the object's class, and then in the superclass of the object's class, and so on, up the hierarchy of superclasses until the method is found or the topmost class (Object) is reached.

In this case, the method lookup process involves searching through instance links and subclass links. However, the order in which these links are followed is important. The method lookup process starts with the instance link of the object, and then it follows zero or more subclass links if the method is not found in the current class.

Therefore, the correct answer is a) one instance link and then zero or more subclass links."
"Input: In a pipelined RISC computer where all arithmetic instructions have the same CPI (cycles per instruction), which of the following actions would improve the execution time of a typical program?
I. Increasing the clock cycle rate
II. Disallowing any forwarding in the pipeline
III. Doubling the sizes of the instruction cache and the data cache without changing the clock cycle time Choices: a) I only b) II only c) III only d) I and III 
Output:
First, I need to understand the given options.
I. Increasing the clock cycle rate means that more instructions can be executed per second, which would improve the execution time of a typical program.
II. Disallowing any forwarding in the pipeline means that the pipeline would stall more often when data dependencies occur, which would slow down the execution of a typical program.
III. Doubling the sizes of the instruction cache and the data cache without changing the clock cycle time means that the computer can store more instructions and data, reducing the number of cache misses and improving the execution time of a typical program.

Now, I need to compare the effects of each option on the execution time of a typical program.
I. Increasing the clock cycle rate would improve the execution time.
II. Disallowing any forwarding in the pipeline would slow down the execution time.
III. Doubling the sizes of the instruction cache and the data cache without changing the clock cycle time would improve the execution time.

Since all three options would improve the execution time of a typical program, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A microcomputer used for data acquisition and control is required to digitize and process four analog input signals and to output their average continually; i.e., in real time. The time for an external analog-to-digital converter (which is triggered by a CPU instruction) to digitize one input is 12 microseconds, and only one digitization occurs at a time. Five CPU instructions, including the triggering instruction, must be executed for each signal digitized. Ten CPU instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples and output this value. The time to convert the output from digital to analog form is to be ignored. If it is assumed that suitable data buffering is employed, then the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, is Choices: a) 0.8 microseconds b) 1.2 microseconds c) 1.6 microseconds d) 2.4 microseconds 
Output:
First, I need to calculate the time required to digitize one input signal. This is 12 microseconds.
Next, I need to calculate the time required to execute five CPU instructions for each signal digitized. This is 5 * time per instruction.
Let's assume the time per instruction is 'x' microseconds. So, the time for five instructions is 5x microseconds.
The total time for digitizing one signal is 12 + 5x microseconds.
Since four signals are digitized, the total time for digitizing all signals is 4 * (12 + 5x) microseconds.
Next, I need to calculate the time required to average each set of four samples and output this value. This is 10 CPU instructions, so the time is 10x microseconds.
The total time for averaging and outputting is 4 * 10x microseconds.
Now, I need to find the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates. This means the total time for digitizing and averaging should be less than or equal to the time between two digitizations.
The time between two digitizations is the time to digitize one input, which is 12 microseconds.
So, the maximum average instruction execution time is the total time for digitizing and averaging divided by the number of signals, which is (4 * (12 + 5x) + 4 * 10x) / 4.
Simplifying this expression, I get 12 + 5x + 10x = 24 + 15x.
Since the total time for digitizing and averaging should be less than or equal to the time between two digitizations, I have the inequality 24 + 15x <= 12.
Solving for 'x', I get x <= 0.8 microseconds.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Suppose that a certain software product has a mean time between failures of 10,000 hours and has a mean time to repair of 20 hours. If the product is used by 100 customers, what is its availability? Choices: a) 80% b) 90% c) 98% d) 99.80% 
Output:
First, I need to calculate the downtime per failure. The mean time to repair is 20 hours, so the downtime per failure is the mean time to repair: 20 hours.
Next, I need to calculate the total downtime per 10,000 hours of operation. The total downtime per failure is 20 hours, and the mean time between failures is 10,000 hours. So, the total downtime per 10,000 hours of operation is 20 hours * (10,000 hours ÷ 10,000 hours) = 20 hours.
Now, I need to calculate the total downtime for 100 customers. Since each customer has the same downtime per failure, the total downtime for 100 customers is 20 hours * 100 = 2,000 hours.
Next, I need to calculate the total uptime for 10,000 hours of operation. The total uptime is the total time minus the total downtime: 10,000 hours - 2,000 hours = 8,000 hours.
Now, I need to calculate the availability. Availability is the total uptime divided by the total time: 8,000 hours ÷ 10,000 hours = 0.8 or 80%.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
