"Input: What were the implications of the Cold War for American exceptionalism? Choices: a) It ended the influence of American exceptionalism entirely b) Exceptionalism was enhanced by America's status as the 'leader of the free world' c) The extension of American power globally challenged core assumptions of exceptionalism d) Both b and c 
Output:
First, I need to understand the concept of American exceptionalism, which is the belief that the United States is unique and superior to other nations.
Next, I need to consider the implications of the Cold War on American exceptionalism. The Cold War was a period of intense political and military tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, which lasted from 1947 to 1991.
During the Cold War, the United States was indeed the 'leader of the free world', as it was the primary opponent of communism and the defender of democracy and capitalism. This leadership role may have enhanced American exceptionalism, as the United States was seen as the guardian of freedom and democracy.
However, the Cold War also challenged core assumptions of American exceptionalism, as the United States was forced to confront the power and influence of the Soviet Union, which was also a superpower. The extension of American power globally during the Cold War required the United States to make compromises and alliances with other nations, which may have undermined the idea of American exceptionalism as a unique and self-sufficient nation.
Therefore, both options b and c are correct, as the Cold War had both positive and negative implications for American exceptionalism.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

Choices: a) The war reduced European population levels below that of the United States b) The United States seized German resources after the war c) European countries paid the United States for assistance d) The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy 
Output:
First, I need to understand the question. The question asks how World War I shifted economic power from Europe to the United States.
a) The war reducing European population levels below that of the United States is not a likely cause of economic power shifting to the United States.
b) Seizing German resources after the war could have temporarily increased the United States' economic power, but it did not shift the long-term economic power from Europe to the United States.
c) European countries paying the United States for assistance could have increased the United States' economic power, but it did not shift the long-term economic power from Europe to the United States.
d) The United States becoming a creditor country and financial center, with European war spending boosting the US economy, is a likely cause of economic power shifting from Europe to the United States. This is because the United States was able to lend money to European countries to finance their war efforts, and in return, they received interest payments and other assets. This increased the United States' economic power and made it a more significant player in the global economy.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: In American government, the power to declare war rests with Choices: a) the president of the United States. b) the secretary of defense. c) the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. d) Congress.

First, I need to understand the context of the Cold War. The Cold War was a period of political tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, characterized by military competition, propaganda, and ideological conflict.
Next, I need to consider how this context might have influenced US perceptions of the Third World. The Third World refers to the developing countries that were not part of the Western or Communist blocs during the Cold War.
Given this context, it is likely that the US viewed the Third World through a geopolitical lens, meaning that local developments were seen in terms of their potential impact on the global balance of power between the US and the Soviet Union. This is because the US was concerned about the spread of communism in the Third World and wanted to prevent the Soviet Union from gaining influence there.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

Output:
First, I need to identify the unique aspect of the NATO intervention in Kosovo.
a) The US had been involved in the Balkans before, so this is not unique.
b) NATO had used military force before, so this is not unique.
c) While airpower was a significant part of the intervention, it was not won by airpower alone. Ground troops were also involved.
d) 'Smart weapons' were not exclusive to the Kosovo intervention, so this is not unique.

The unique aspect of the NATO intervention in Kosovo was that it was the first time NATO used military force without the consent of the United Nations Security Council. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Output:
First, I need to consider each option to determine which one(s) best explain the uncertainty over which states have nuclear weapons.
a) Leaders have incentives to lie: This is true because if a leader admits to having nuclear weapons, they may face international sanctions, pressure to disarm, or even military intervention.
b) If leaders revealed their programs, they would be more likely to be attacked: This is also true because if a state's nuclear program is known, it may make them a target for other countries or terrorist groups.
c) Leaders will not always grant foreign monitors access to their nuclear programs: This is true because some leaders may view foreign monitoring as an invasion of their sovereignty and may refuse to allow it.
d) ALL of the above: This is the correct answer because all three options provide reasons for the uncertainty over which states have nuclear weapons.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

Output:
First, I need to consider the reasons why countries might try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market.
a) Irrationality on the part of the leadership is not a likely reason, as leaders are expected to make decisions based on the best interests of their country.
b) Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed is a possible reason. In this case, the costs of competition from foreign firms might be borne by a small number of domestic firms, while the benefits of free trade are spread out among the entire population.
c) Regime type is not directly related to the protection of domestic firms from foreign competition.
d) International conflict prevents trade is not always the case, as many countries engage in trade even during times of conflict.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Why did George H.W. Bush allow Saddam Hussein to remain in power after the Gulf War of 1991? Choices: a) Lack of US firepower b) Concern over oil supplies c) Limited UN mandate and fear of a protracted conflict d) Difficult terrain and fear of civilian casualties 
Output:

d) Difficult terrain and fear of civilian casualties is not a valid reason, as the US did not invade Iraq due to these concerns.
c) Limited UN mandate and fear of a protracted conflict is a valid reason. The UN mandate for the Gulf War was to expel Iraq from Kuwait, not to overthrow Saddam Hussein. Additionally, Bush was concerned about the potential for a long and costly conflict if the US were to invade Iraq.

First, I need to understand the context of the Truman Doctrine. It was a policy statement made by President Harry S. Truman in 1947, in which he pledged to aid Greece and Turkey in their fight against communist insurgencies.
The Truman Doctrine indicated that the US would provide aid to any country threatened by communist takeover, especially in Europe. This was a significant shift in US foreign policy, as it marked a clear commitment to contain the spread of communism.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: What tend to be the effects of oil and other natural resource trade on developing states? Choices: a) It democratizes countries b) It has no real effect c) It encourages stability of the regime d) It changes the nature of the investor 
Output:
First, I need to consider the potential effects of oil and other natural resource trade on developing states.
a) It democratizes countries: While some argue that resource wealth can lead to increased government revenue and thus political stability, it can also lead to corruption and authoritarianism, as the ruling elite may use the resources to maintain power and suppress opposition.
b) It has no real effect: This is an oversimplification, as resource trade can have significant impacts on a country's economy, politics, and society.
c) It encourages stability of the regime: As mentioned earlier, resource wealth can lead to increased government revenue and political stability, but it can also lead to corruption and authoritarianism, which can destabilize a regime.
d) It changes the nature of the investor: Yes, resource trade can attract foreign investors, but the nature of these investors may be influenced by the country's resource wealth. For example, they may be more interested in extracting resources than in promoting sustainable development or social welfare.
Therefore, the most accurate answer is that oil and other natural resource trade can have complex and varied effects on developing states, and it is not accurate to say that it has no real effect or that it always encourages stability of the regime. The answer is {'sol': 'b' is incorrect, 'c' is partially correct, 'd' is correct, and 'a' is partially correct}. However, since the question asks for the primary effect, the best answer would be {'sol': 'd'}."

b) Neoconservatism is a political ideology that advocates for the use of military force to promote democracy and free markets.
c) Isolationism is a policy of avoiding entanglements in the affairs of other countries.
d) Protectionism is an economic policy of restricting foreign trade to protect domestic industries.

Since the question asks for the dominant course for foreign policy throughout most of American history, I would say that containment is the most appropriate answer, as it was a significant strategy during the Cold War and has been a recurring theme in American foreign policy.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: What led Britain to impose new taxes on their American colonies? Choices: a) To increase the wealth of King George III b) The growing costs of war with France c) Anger at America's growing prosperity d) Pressure from rich merchants 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context. The question is asking about the reason Britain imposed new taxes on their American colonies.
a) To increase the wealth of King George III is not a likely reason, as the taxes would have been unpopular and could have led to rebellion.
b) The growing costs of war with France could have been a factor, as Britain was heavily in debt from the war. However, the question asks specifically about the taxes on the American colonies, not the war in general.
c) Anger at America's growing prosperity is not a likely reason, as the colonies were a significant source of wealth for Britain.
d) Pressure from rich merchants is a possible answer, as they may have wanted to increase their profits by taxing the colonies.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Who said ""Globalization is not something we can hold off or turn off. It is the economic equivalent of a force of nature-like wind or water""? Choices: a) Ronald Reagan b) George Soros c) Bill Clinton d) George W. Bush

Output:
First, I need to understand the context of US expansion before and after 1865. Before 1865, US expansion was primarily focused on acquiring new territories, such as the Louisiana Purchase, the Oregon Territory, and the Mexican Cession.
After 1865, the focus of US expansion shifted from acquiring new territories to developing existing territories and markets. This was due to the completion of the transcontinental railroad and the industrial revolution, which made it easier to transport goods and services across the country.
Therefore, the key difference between US expansion pre- and post-1865 is that US expansion was based on territory rather than markets before 1865, but it was based on markets rather than territory after 1865.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

b) Monitor parties: IGOs often monitor the actions of member countries to ensure compliance with international agreements.
c) Provide fora for discussion: IGOs provide a platform for member countries to discuss and negotiate international issues.
d) Reduce transaction costs for agreements: IGOs can help reduce transaction costs by providing standardized rules and procedures for international agreements.

However, IGOs do not typically do any of these actions ""seldom."" Therefore, the question seems to be asking for the least common activity among the given choices.

Since IGOs do not typically provide strong enforcement, the answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

First, I need to understand the context of the question. The question asks about the reasons Americans believed they could found a different kind of empire after 1776, which refers to the establishment of the United States of America.
a) An 'empire of liberty' is a possible answer because the American Revolution was fought in part to establish a government based on the principles of liberty and freedom.
b) Multi-cultural is not a primary reason Americans believed they could found a different kind of empire. While the United States has always been a diverse nation, this was not a primary motivation for founding the country.
c) Expansion is a possible answer because the United States has a history of territorial expansion, but it was not the primary reason Americans believed they could found a different kind of empire.

"Input: Which of the following considers it immoral to use force abroad to do good things (such human rights protection, democracy, etc)? Choices: a) Realism b) Idealism c) Liberalism d) None of the above 
Output:
First, I need to understand the given choices. Realism is a political theory that emphasizes the role of power and national interest in international relations. Idealism is a political theory that emphasizes moral principles and the pursuit of peace and justice. Liberalism is a political philosophy that emphasizes individual rights and freedoms.

Next, I need to consider which of these theories would consider it immoral to use force abroad to do good things. Idealism, as it emphasizes moral principles and the pursuit of peace, might be the one that would consider it immoral to use force, as it could lead to harm and violate the rights of others.

However, it's important to note that not all idealists would necessarily hold this view, as they might believe that sometimes force is necessary to protect human rights or establish democracy. Therefore, it's more accurate to say that some idealists might consider it immoral to use force abroad, rather than all idealists.

Finally, I need to choose the answer that best fits the question. The question asks for the theory that considers it immoral to use force abroad to do good things, and while not all idealists would hold this view, some would. Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

The fundamental difference between the two systems is that the international system lacks a central authority, unlike the domestic system where there is a central government. In the international system, there is no world government to enforce laws and maintain order, leading to a state of anarchy. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

"Input: Why might the 'Philadelphian System' be linked to the idea of American exceptionalism? Choices: a) It encouraged greater involvement in European politics b) It was designed as the antithesis of European politics c) It created a large standing army d) It encouraged the centralization of political power in the US 
Output:
First, I need to understand the Philadelphian System. The Philadelphian System refers to the political system established at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, which created the United States Constitution.

Choices: a) Having the capability to deter the most powerful rival b) Having the capability to deter smaller states c) How nuclear attacks are identified and responded to; who controls the weapons d) Bureaucratic politics provides no information about nuclear proliferation and use 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of bureaucratic politics. It refers to the internal politics of an organization, especially a government department or bureaucracy.
Next, I need to consider how this relates to nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are powerful and can cause massive destruction, so the ability to deter others from using them is important.
However, the question asks about what we should be worried about with regard to nuclear weapons, not just the ability to deter.
The question also mentions smaller states, which suggests that the concern might be about nuclear proliferation, or the spread of nuclear weapons to more countries, especially smaller ones.
The question also mentions how nuclear attacks are identified and responded to, which suggests a concern about the control of nuclear weapons and the potential for misuse or accidental launch.
The question does not mention anything about bureaucratic politics providing no information about nuclear proliferation and use, so that option can be eliminated.
Therefore, the correct answer is likely either a) Having the capability to deter the most powerful rival or c) How nuclear attacks are identified and responded to; who controls the weapons. However, the question seems to be more focused on the latter, so the correct answer is likely {'sol': 'c'}."

The choice 'A new democratic internationalism led by the United States' seems to be a political system, but it does not necessarily imply a 'new world order'.
The choice 'A new balance of power between the US and China' seems to be a political system, but it does not necessarily imply a 'new world order'.
The choice 'A new global economic framework' seems to be a system that could be considered a 'new world order', as it would affect the entire world.
The choice 'A new era of globalization' seems to be a system that could be considered a 'new world order', as it would affect the entire world.
However, the question asks for the term 'New World Order', not a system that could be considered a 'new world order'.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

Output:
First, I need to understand the context. Lincoln's presidency was during the 1860s, a time when the issue of slavery was a major point of contention.
Next, I need to consider the reasons Lincoln might have opposed southward expansion.
a) It would have drained the US economically: This is not a likely reason, as the southward expansion would have provided new resources and markets for the US.
b) It would have involved compromising opposition to slavery: This is a likely reason. Lincoln was against the expansion of slavery, and allowing it to spread further would have been a compromise of his anti-slavery stance.
c) It would have increased immigration to the US: This is not a likely reason, as the southward expansion would have primarily attracted southerners, not immigrants.
d) None of the above: This is not a correct answer, as one of the reasons I identified (b) is a valid reason.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

"Input: What is the implication of American exceptionalism in terms of global economics? Choices: a) It encourages the use of tariffs b) It encourages nationalization c) It encourages liberalization of global trade d) It encourages redistribution of wealth 
Output:
First, I need to understand the concept of American exceptionalism. It is a belief that the United States is unique and superior to other nations, often in terms of its political and economic systems.
Next, I need to consider how this belief might influence global economics.
a) Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, which can protect domestic industries but can also lead to trade disputes and higher prices for consumers. This is not necessarily encouraged by American exceptionalism, as it can be seen as protectionist and not in line with the idea of global free trade.
b) Nationalization is the process of a government taking control of private businesses. This is not necessarily encouraged by American exceptionalism, as it goes against the idea of free-market capitalism that is often associated with the United States.
c) Liberalization of global trade is the process of reducing barriers to trade between countries. This is often encouraged by American exceptionalism, as it allows American businesses to have greater access to foreign markets and can lead to economic growth.
d) Redistribution of wealth is the process of taking resources from the wealthy and giving them to the poor. This is not necessarily encouraged by American exceptionalism, as it goes against the idea of individualism and self-reliance that is often associated with the United States.

Next, I need to consider the options given. The options suggest different approaches to dealing with the Soviet Union: economic containment, engagement, military containment, and dispensing with the idea of containment.

Choices: a) They see it as a challenge to European global influence b) They see it as an ideological façade for US imperialism c) They see it as a temporary phenomenon d) None of the above 
Output:
First, I need to understand the concept of exceptionalism in the context of American foreign policy. Exceptionalism refers to the belief that the United States is unique and exceptional among nations, and that it has a special role or mission in the world.
Next, I need to consider the perspective of contemporary European liberal democrats. These democrats generally support a rules-based international order, multilateralism, and cooperation among nations.
Now, I need to consider why they might object to the influence of exceptionalism on American foreign policy. One reason could be that they see it as a challenge to European global influence, as it may lead to unilateral actions by the United States that undermine the rules-based international order and multilateral cooperation. Another reason could be that they see it as an ideological façade for US imperialism, as it may be used to justify aggressive foreign policies that serve US interests at the expense of other nations. However, it's also possible that they see it as a temporary phenomenon, as they may believe that the influence of exceptionalism on American foreign policy will wane over time.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: In what sense might exceptionalism link isolationist and internationalist strategies? Choices: a) Both encourage world government b) Both focus on the decline of the American power c) It doesn't - the two are fundamentally opposed d) Both can be viewed as different means of achieving the same liberal ends 
Output:
First, I need to understand the meaning of exceptionalism. Exceptionalism refers to the belief that a particular group, nation, or people is unique and superior to others.
Next, I need to understand the meanings of isolationist and internationalist strategies. Isolationism is a foreign policy that advocates for a nation to avoid entanglements in the affairs of other nations. Internationalism is a foreign policy that advocates for a nation to actively participate in the affairs of other nations, often through diplomacy, alliances, and international organizations.
Now, I need to consider how exceptionalism might link these two strategies. One way might be that both isolationism and internationalism can be seen as strategies for preserving the exceptional nature of a nation. An isolationist might believe that by avoiding entanglements with other nations, their exceptional nation can maintain its unique identity and superiority. An internationalist might believe that by actively participating in the affairs of other nations, their exceptional nation can spread its unique values and ideals, thereby preserving its exceptional status.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

Output:
First, I need to understand the meaning of realism in foreign policy. Realism is a school of thought that emphasizes the pursuit of power and national interest in international relations.
Next, I need to understand the meaning of exceptionalism in American foreign policy. Exceptionalism refers to the belief that the United States is unique and exceptional among nations, and that it has a special role to play in the world.
Now, I need to consider how exceptionalism might affect realist foreign policy. Exceptionalism might lead to a diminished focus on collective security, as the United States might prioritize its own interests over the interests of other nations. It might also lead to a diminished focus on security, power, and interest, as the United States might prioritize its unique role in the world over the practical considerations of power and interest.
However, exceptionalism might also enhance the prospects for world government, as the United States, being exceptional, might be seen as a leader in promoting global governance.
Therefore, realists might object to the influence of exceptionalism on American foreign policy because it leads to a diminished focus on collective security and security, power, and interest. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

The correct answer is c) Embrace multi-polarity, show greater restraint internationally and require other states to meet their own security burdens. This policy aligns with the Offshore Balancing strategy because it emphasizes the importance of other states taking responsibility for their own security, rather than relying on the United States for protection.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

"Input: What drives US foreign policy according to the Marxist perspective? Choices: a) Economic protectionism b) Class consciousness c) The search for new markets d) Superstructure 
Output:
First, I need to understand the Marxist perspective on foreign policy. According to Marxist theory, the superstructure (which includes political and legal institutions, as well as ideologies) is determined by the economic base (the mode of production and the relations of production).
In the context of foreign policy, the economic base would be the dominant class's interests, which are primarily economic. Therefore, the driving force of US foreign policy according to the Marxist perspective would be the pursuit of economic interests.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Why might American exceptionalism lead to opposition to world government? Choices: a) Its general anti-statism opposes centralized government b) It views world government as impractical c) It views the UN as a sufficient form of global governance d) None of the above 
Output:
First, I need to understand the concept of American exceptionalism, which is the belief that the United States is unique and superior to other nations.
Next, I need to consider how this belief might lead to opposition to world government.
One possible reason is that American exceptionalism might lead to a general anti-statism, or a distrust of centralized government, as it might be seen as a threat to American sovereignty and individual freedoms.
Another reason could be that American exceptionalism might view world government as impractical, as it might be difficult to reach consensus among so many different nations with diverse cultures, economies, and political systems.
However, it's also possible that some proponents of American exceptionalism might view the United Nations as a sufficient form of global governance, as it already provides a platform for international cooperation and diplomacy.
Therefore, the correct answer is not necessarily clear-cut, as it depends on the specific beliefs and perspectives of those who hold American exceptionalist views.
However, based on the choices provided, the best answer would be {'sol': 'a'}."

None of the above is not a theory in international relations.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

First, I need to understand the statement about the importance of oil in shaping U.S. foreign policy. This suggests that oil plays a significant role in U.S. foreign policy decisions.
Next, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) suggests that military superiority is important, but the statement does not directly support this. Option b) suggests that the importance of oil is often overexaggerated, which contradicts the statement. Option c) suggests that economic instruments of foreign policy are becoming more important, which could be a possible answer if the statement implies that oil is a key economic factor.

First, I need to understand the two approaches being compared: Ideational and Realist. Ideational approaches focus on the role of ideology and beliefs in shaping foreign policy, while Realist accounts emphasize material interests and power.
Next, I need to compare these two approaches in the context of the Cold War. Ideational approaches would place greater emphasis on ideology and beliefs, such as the spread of democracy or the containment of communism, while Realist accounts would focus more on material interests and power, such as the balance of power or the prevention of war.
Finally, I can conclude that the Ideational approaches differ from Realist accounts of the Cold War by placing greater emphasis on ideology and beliefs, as opposed to material interests and power. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

c) The Presidency welcomed the influence of Congress suggests that the President was open to input from Congress, which is a more accurate description of the relationship during this time period.
d) None of the above is not a good answer because it does not match any of the choices provided.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Which of the following points supports the argument for American unilateralism? Choices: a) Benevolent hegemony b) Ineffectiveness of multilateralism c) American power d) All of the above 
Output:
First, I need to understand the argument for American unilateralism. Unilateralism refers to the policy of a single nation acting independently, without regard for international cooperation or approval. The argument for American unilateralism often revolves around the idea that the United States has unique power and resources that make it capable of acting alone effectively, and that multilateralism can be inefficient or ineffective due to the need for consensus and compromise.

Next, I need to analyze the given choices to see which one supports the argument for American unilateralism.
a) Benevolent hegemony does not necessarily support unilateralism, as it implies a dominant power using its influence for the benefit of others.
b) Ineffectiveness of multilateralism supports the argument for American unilateralism, as it suggests that the United States can act more effectively alone.
c) American power supports the argument for American unilateralism, as it implies that the United States has the capability to act alone effectively.
d) All of the above includes both the ineffectiveness of multilateralism and American power, which support the argument for American unilateralism.

"Input: International development may be tied to the security of the state, why? Choices: a) Threats to the state centralize political and economic power, threatening state development b) Too many casualties drain the productive power of the state c) Threats to the state encourage socialism d) The two are correlated, but there is no causal effect 
Output:
First, I need to consider the relationship between international development and state security.
a) Threats to the state centralize political and economic power, which can lead to development as resources are focused on security. However, this may not be sustainable or equitable development.
b) Too many casualties drain the productive power of the state, but this is more a result of insecurity rather than a cause.
c) Threats to the state may encourage socialism, but this is more a result of the perceived need for a more equitable distribution of resources rather than a direct cause of development.
d) The two are correlated, but there is no causal effect. This is because while development can lead to increased security, it does not necessarily cause it, and vice versa.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

Finally, I can choose the correct answer, which is c. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: What has been an effective way of disbursing US foreign aid to encourage change in target states? Choices: a) Conditional programs, such as the Millennium Challenge, that require change before receipt of aid b) the use of intergovernmental organizations to monitor aid disbursement c) withdrawal of aid for bad policies d) None of the above, international aid never works 
Output:
First, I need to consider the purpose of US foreign aid, which is to encourage change in target states.
a) Conditional programs, such as the Millennium Challenge, that require change before receipt of aid are an effective way to encourage change in target states because they incentivize the recipient government to make the necessary changes to qualify for aid.
b) The use of intergovernmental organizations to monitor aid disbursement can help ensure that the aid is used effectively and efficiently, but it does not necessarily encourage change in the target state.
c) Withdrawal of aid for bad policies can be a punitive measure, but it does not necessarily encourage change in the target state.
d) The statement ""None of the above, international aid never works"" is not supported by evidence.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
