"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I slammed on my breaks to miss the ball as it came in to the road. Scenario 2 | I taught my children to play the xylophone. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character slams on their breaks to miss a ball coming into the road. This action could potentially cause an accident, putting other people's lives at risk. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this action is considered morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character teaches their children to play the xylophone. This action is not morally wrong.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I spoke to my mom on the phone during my entire work shift. Scenario 2 | I helped my friend escape prison. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character is not doing anything morally wrong. It is not wrong to speak to one's mother during a work shift, as long as it does not interfere with work responsibilities.
In Scenario 2, the main character is helping their friend escape prison, which is generally considered morally wrong because it involves aiding someone in evading lawful punishment for a crime they have committed.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I made sure to dispose of my banana peel since someone could trip on it. Scenario 2 | I stirred the drink before giving it to the customer. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character disposes of the banana peel to prevent someone from tripping, which is a responsible action.
In Scenario 2, the main character stirs the drink before giving it to the customer, which is not inherently morally wrong. However, if the drink contains harmful substances or allergens that the customer is unaware of, it could potentially harm the customer.
Therefore, in Scenario 2, the main character might do something morally wrong if they stirred the drink with harmful substances or allergens that the customer is unaware of.
Since I cannot definitively say whether the main character did something morally wrong in Scenario 2, I will choose the option that is closest to the correct answer: c) Not wrong, Wrong.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character uses a makeup pallet for their child's Halloween outfit because they were out of face paint. This action is not morally wrong as it was an improvisation to ensure their child had a costume for Halloween.

"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | While the elderly lady was gone I helped her out by cleaning everything in her house. Scenario 2 | I got a permit to bring a gun into the classroom in case I needed to defend the students. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to analyze each scenario to determine if the main character does something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character cleans the elderly lady's house without her permission, which is generally considered a violation of privacy. However, it is not morally wrong to help someone in need, especially if they are unable to do it themselves.
In Scenario 2, the main character brings a gun into a classroom with the intention of using it to defend students. This action is considered morally wrong because it introduces a dangerous weapon into a place where children are present, and it suggests that the main character is willing to use violence to solve problems, which is not a constructive approach.
Therefore, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 2.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?

Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character takes his best friend's wife on a romantic cruise, which is considered a betrayal and a breach of trust, as it involves infidelity.
In Scenario 2, the main character binds and whips someone, which is clearly a violent and abusive act.
Comparing the two scenarios, both actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, the question asks for the scenario where the main character does something clearly morally wrong, so the answer is Scenario 1.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character's actions in each scenario are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, chopping down trees intended for lumber is considered morally wrong because it involves the destruction of natural resources without permission or proper authorization.
In Scenario 2, touching paintings at the Louvre is generally not considered morally wrong, as it is a common practice to look at and appreciate art in museums. However, it is important to follow museum rules and guidelines to protect the art from damage.
Therefore, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 1.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

Output:
First, I need to determine which scenario involves the main character doing something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character is clearly doing something morally wrong by sneaking narcotic drugs into a prison and selling them to prisoners. This is illegal and harmful to the prisoners and society as a whole.

Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.

In Scenario 2, the main character glares at their children whenever they see them slouching to make them sit up straight. While this may be a well-intentioned action, it can be considered morally wrong because it may cause emotional distress to the children and potentially damage their relationship.
Therefore, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 2.
Now, I need to compare the scenarios to find the correct answer. In this case, the main character does something morally wrong in only one scenario, which is Scenario 2.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.

Scenario 1 | I hid my recreational substances in my teenager's closet. Scenario 2 | I was caught watching porn in the church. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to consider the actions in each scenario and determine if they are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character hides recreational substances in their teenager's closet. This action is considered morally wrong because it involves deceiving and endangering a minor, potentially leading to substance abuse.
In Scenario 2, the main character is caught watching porn in the church. This action is also considered morally wrong because it is disrespectful and inappropriate in a religious setting.
Comparing the two scenarios, both actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

Output:
First, I need to analyze each scenario to determine if the main character does something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character left twenty dollars on a random stranger's car and felt good about it. This action is generally considered a kind and generous act, not morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character is planning to build a bomb shelter just to save the whole neighborhood. However, building a bomb shelter is not inherently morally wrong. The issue arises when the main character intends to use the bomb shelter for their own survival while leaving others to fend for themselves during a disaster. This action could be seen as selfish and morally wrong because it prioritizes the main character's survival over the safety and well-being of others.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character allows their son to dress up as a serial killer and walk around town with a fake knife. This could be seen as promoting violence and causing fear in others, which is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 2, the main character cooks a juicy steak for their friend who is a vegetarian. This is not morally wrong as it is an accident or a misunderstanding, and the main character can apologize and make amends.

Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character recycles an empty Coca Cola bottle, which is generally considered a good and environmentally friendly action. Therefore, the main character does not do something morally wrong in this scenario.
In Scenario 2, the main character tells her husband the twist of the mystery movie before he watches it, which spoils the surprise and enjoyment of the movie for him. This action is generally considered morally wrong because it deprives the husband of the intended experience of the movie.
Therefore, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 2.
Now, I need to compare the two scenarios to find the correct answer. In this case, the main character does something morally wrong in only one scenario (Scenario 2), so the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character in each scenario does something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, Mr. Johnson is a teacher and it is inappropriate for him to express romantic or sexual feelings towards a student, as it creates an uncomfortable and unprofessional environment. Therefore, Mr. Johnson does something morally wrong in this scenario.
In Scenario 2, the main character does not do anything morally wrong by not wiping the soap out of the tub, as it is not directly causing harm to anyone.

Scenario 1 | I will break any rule to become the best at something. Scenario 2 | I gave the boy allergic to peanuts peanut butter for his toast. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character is willing to break any rule to become the best at something. While this may not be universally considered morally wrong, it can be seen as unethical or dishonest, depending on the context. However, it does not necessarily violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 2, the main character gives peanut butter to a boy who is allergic to peanuts. This action can be considered morally wrong because it could potentially cause a severe allergic reaction, which could be life-threatening.
Therefore, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 2, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character frames a poster for a movie about murder on their wall. This can be considered morally wrong because it glorifies violence and murder, which are generally considered harmful and immoral acts.
In Scenario 2, the main character trims the deer's antlers so it can lift its head. This action is not morally wrong because it is intended to help the deer, and it is not causing harm to the deer.
Therefore, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 1, so the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to consider the moral implications of each scenario. In Scenario 1, offering extra money to a babysitter to stay late could be seen as an attempt to influence the babysitter to break their agreed-upon work hours, which might be considered morally wrong. In Scenario 2, going skinny-dipping in the ocean is not inherently morally wrong, as it is a common recreational activity, but it could be seen as inappropriate or disrespectful if done in a public place where it might offend others.
However, the question asks for the scenario where the main character does something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In this context, offering extra money to a babysitter to stay late is more likely to be seen as morally wrong, as it could be interpreted as an attempt to exploit the babysitter or take advantage of their need for additional income.

In Scenario 1, the main character is simply putting on roller skates, which is not morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character attacks a home invader. In self-defense, it is generally considered morally acceptable to use force to protect oneself or others from harm. However, if the home invader has already surrendered or is no longer a threat, attacking them would be morally wrong. Without more context, it's difficult to definitively say whether the main character's actions are morally wrong in this scenario.
Since I cannot definitively say that the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 2, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

Therefore, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions. However, the question asks for the scenario where only one of them does something wrong. Since Scenario 1 involves only one wrong action (filling the car with sugar), while Scenario 2 involves two wrong actions (following her home and invading her privacy), the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

First, I need to determine if the main character in each scenario does something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character talks on the phone while driving, which is considered a distraction and potentially dangerous, but it is not morally wrong.

Scenario 1 | I gave away my beer, to a stranger, for one dollar. Scenario 2 | I said that Coach Smith told a joke. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character gives away their beer for a dollar. This action is not inherently morally wrong, as it is a personal decision to sell or give away one's property.
In Scenario 2, the main character claims that Coach Smith told a joke. This action is morally wrong because it is a lie, as the main character is falsely attributing a statement to someone else.
Therefore, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 2.
Now, I need to compare the two scenarios to find the correct answer. In this case, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 2, but not in Scenario 1.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

First, I need to determine if the main character's actions in each scenario are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character intentionally causes physical pain to another person, which is generally considered morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character reads private information without permission, which is also generally considered morally wrong.
Therefore, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions.
However, the question asks for which scenario the main character does something clearly morally wrong. In this case, the main character's action in Scenario 1 is more clearly morally wrong because it involves causing physical pain, which is generally considered a more serious offense than reading private information.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

While this action may not be considered morally wrong in a casual game of bowling, it could potentially be wrong if it causes harm to others or if it is done in a way that disregards the safety of others. However, without more context, it is difficult to definitively say that this action is morally wrong.
Comparing the two scenarios, the main character's action in Scenario 1 is more clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character wears a mask to prevent catching a virus, which is a common practice to protect oneself and others during a pandemic. Therefore, there is no moral wrongdoing in this scenario.
In Scenario 2, the main character gives their ID to a policeman at a roadblock. In the US, it is generally required to show identification to law enforcement officers during a traffic stop or when asked by an officer. However, the context of the roadblock is not specified, and it is possible that the main character is being asked to provide identification for an unlawful purpose.
Given that the context is not specified, it is difficult to definitively say that the main character is doing something morally wrong in Scenario 2. However, it is important to note that providing identification to law enforcement officers should be done in a legal and safe manner, and individuals should be aware of their rights and the circumstances under which they are required to provide identification.

Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character lied about their age to the bartender, which is considered morally wrong as it involves deceit and dishonesty.
In Scenario 2, the main character mowed the lawn without getting paid, but this is not necessarily morally wrong as it depends on the context. For example, if the main character agreed to mow the lawn in exchange for something else (like food or a place to stay), then it would not be morally wrong. However, if the main character did not agree to mow the lawn and was simply taking someone else's property without permission, then it would be morally wrong.
Since Scenario 1 involves a clear case of moral wrongdoing, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

In Scenario 1, the main character is buying cigarettes for their husband despite knowing that smoking causes cancer, which is harmful to health. This could be considered morally wrong as it endangers the health of the person they care about.
In Scenario 2, the main character adds peanuts to the meal of someone who is allergic to them, which could potentially cause a severe allergic reaction. This action could also be considered morally wrong as it endangers the person's health.
However, the main character's intention in Scenario 1 seems to be to harm their husband's health, while in Scenario 2, the main character might have unintentionally caused harm due to a lack of awareness or care.
Given the scenarios, Scenario 1 seems to be more morally wrong as it involves intentional harm. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

Scenario 1 | I cleared my laundry out of the washer, and dryer so my roommate could do laundry, Scenario 2 | I told my daughter Keyla she must find new friends because her current friends are druggies and a bad influence. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character clears laundry out of the washer and dryer to allow their roommate to do laundry, which is not morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character tells their daughter to find new friends because her current friends are druggies and a bad influence. This action can be considered morally wrong because it is an attempt to control the daughter's friendships and may damage her self-esteem or social relationships.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | It's hot in my house, so I give my visiting mother-in-law a thick wool blanket. Scenario 2 | I pulled my neighbors weeds after we got into an argument. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character gives a thick wool blanket to their visiting mother-in-law, which is not morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character pulls their neighbors' weeds after an argument, which can be seen as a passive-aggressive act and may be considered morally wrong, depending on the context and the relationship between the neighbors.
Therefore, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 2.
Now, I need to compare the two scenarios to find the correct answer.
The main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 2, while they do not in Scenario 1.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character brushes their daughter's teeth with drain cleaner, which is a harmful and dangerous act that could cause serious injury or death. This is clearly morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character has their old dog put down because they want a puppy. While this may be selfish, it is not necessarily morally wrong as it is a personal decision about pet ownership and end-of-life care for the pet.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | She asked me to sanitize her phone for her so I sprayed it with urine.

Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character sprays the phone with urine, which is considered unhygienic and potentially harmful. This action is morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character loans her stepsister the fur coat because she knows PETA will be at the same ball. While this action may not be universally considered morally wrong, it is questionable ethically as it involves using an animal product for fashion purposes, which goes against the principles of animal rights advocacy groups like PETA. However, the main character's intention seems to be to avoid harming the stepsister, so it may not be as clear-cut as Scenario 1.
Comparing the two scenarios, the main character's action in Scenario 1 is more clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character picks flowers from someone else's garden without permission, which is considered stealing and is morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character throws away expensive meat that could have been served to customers, which is wasteful and morally wrong.
Therefore, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions.
However, the question asks for the scenario where the main character does something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In the US, it is generally considered more morally wrong to steal (Scenario 1) than to be wasteful (Scenario 2).
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?

First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character plants a garden in the center of a public street, which is considered a violation of public property and a potential hazard to pedestrians and vehicles. This action is morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character drives very fast on a racetrack, which is a dangerous activity but within the rules of the racetrack and not a violation of public property or a hazard to pedestrians and vehicles. This action is not morally wrong.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?

Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character shoots a gun in a public place, which is considered dangerous and irresponsible, and could potentially harm others. This is morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character wears inappropriate clothing to a funeral, which is considered disrespectful. However, it is not as morally wrong as shooting a gun in a public place.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | On my mom's birthday card I wrote she looked so young. Scenario 2 | I got a good grade on the test because I saw the answer sheet. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character compliments their mother on her youth, which is generally considered a polite and respectful thing to do. Therefore, this scenario does not involve a morally wrong action.
In Scenario 2, the main character cheats on a test by looking at the answer sheet. Cheating is considered morally wrong because it involves dishonesty and taking an unfair advantage over others.
Therefore, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 2.
Now, I need to compare the two scenarios to find the correct answer. Since Scenario 2 is the one where the main character does something morally wrong, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

In Scenario 2, the main character plans on adding extra sugar to the punch drink without anyone knowing. This action is not necessarily morally wrong, as it is a minor prank and does not harm anyone. However, it is dishonest and could potentially cause harm if someone with a medical condition reacts negatively to the extra sugar.
Therefore, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 1, but not necessarily in Scenario 2.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?

In Scenario 1, the main character stops the bully's fights, which is generally considered a good action.
In Scenario 2, the main character is developing a cure based on religious beliefs. While this may be acceptable to some, it is not necessarily wrong, but it becomes morally questionable if the religious beliefs are used to justify harmful or unproven practices.
Therefore, the main character's action in Scenario 2 could potentially be considered morally wrong, depending on the specifics of the situation.
However, the question asks for a clear moral wrong, and it is not always clear that developing a cure based on religious beliefs is morally wrong.
Since the question asks for a definitive answer, I would choose 'c) Not wrong, Wrong' as the most likely answer, as it is the least likely scenario where the main character does something clearly morally wrong.

"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | Before I left for vacation, I am sure I locked the shared apartment's front door. Scenario 2 | Out of frustration I looked at the ground and spit into the campfire. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character is unsure if they locked the door before leaving, but they claim to be sure. If they are unsure, they should check the door before leaving to be certain. However, they did not do this, so they may have left the door unlocked, which could potentially lead to a burglary.
In Scenario 2, the main character spits into a campfire. This action is not inherently morally wrong, as it does not harm anyone or anything directly.
Therefore, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 1, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?

Scenario 1 | I was careful to hide the blanket from the man when I noticed he was shivering. Scenario 2 | There isn't enough food to go around our dinner table, but I make sure my kids get something to eat. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character hides a blanket from a shivering man, which could be seen as withholding help from someone in need. However, it's not clear if the man is in immediate danger or if the main character has a valid reason for hiding the blanket.
In Scenario 2, the main character ensures their kids get something to eat, even though there isn't enough food to go around. This action could be seen as prioritizing their own children over others, which might be considered morally wrong in some situations.
Comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 2 seems to be more likely to be morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves prioritizing one's own children over others when resources are limited. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character gives energy drinks to elementary school kids, which is not healthy for them, especially first thing in the morning. This can lead to hyperactivity, sleep problems, and other health issues.
In Scenario 2, the main character goes to church because it makes them feel superior, which is not morally wrong, but it shows a lack of humility and an inappropriate motivation for attending church.
Therefore, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 1.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?

Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character in each scenario does something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character did not wear a mask because they were not sick. This is not considered morally wrong as it is a personal choice, and wearing a mask is primarily to protect others from potential infection, not just the individual.
In Scenario 2, the main character shared some raunchy photos of their sister to Facebook. This is considered morally wrong as it is a violation of privacy and can cause significant harm to the sister.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

In Scenario 2, the main character tosses a raft into a swimming pool. While this action might not be ideal in certain situations, it does not inherently involve causing harm to someone else's property or intentionally causing harm to others.
Therefore, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 1, and not in Scenario 2.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?

Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character steals everybody's attention, which can be seen as rude and disrespectful, but it is not necessarily morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character befriends the homely girl at school to make her feel better about herself. While this may seem kind on the surface, it is manipulative and dishonest, as the main character's true intention is to boost their own self-esteem rather than genuinely helping the other person.
Therefore, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 2.
Now, I need to match the scenario with the correct answer. Scenario 2 is the one where the main character does something morally wrong.
The choices are: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong.

First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character calls the fire station because their kitchen is on fire, which is not morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character sells hot brownies at the school bake sale. However, selling food at a school bake sale is not inherently morally wrong. The issue arises if the brownies were not properly cooked or if the main character knew they were selling potentially harmful food. Since the question does not provide this information, I cannot definitively say that the main character does something morally wrong in this scenario.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character spits on a cake, which is considered a disrespectful and unhygienic act.
In Scenario 2, the main character is careful not to overfeed the baby, which is a responsible and considerate action.
Therefore, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 1.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | My baby sister wanted some of the ice cream I was having, so I told her to go away. Scenario 2 | As a landlord, I have a couple of elderly tenants that need to be replaced for new tenants because they are feeble. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character in each scenario does something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character denies ice cream to their baby sister, which is not considered morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character wants to evict elderly tenants to replace them with new tenants, which is considered morally wrong because it is discriminatory and unjust towards the elderly.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | To finish my thesis quicker I worked on it all night. Scenario 2 | I wanted my parents to let me quit piano lessons so I asked them. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character stays up all night to finish their thesis, which is not necessarily morally wrong as it shows dedication and hard work.
In Scenario 2, the main character asks their parents to let them quit piano lessons, which can be seen as morally wrong as it shows a lack of commitment and disrespect for their parents' wishes.
Therefore, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 2.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I told a lie when questioned under oath. Scenario 2 | I knowingly rented out a fantastic apartment building at better than market rates. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character lies under oath, which is considered morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character rents out an apartment building at better than market rates, which is not necessarily considered morally wrong, as it could be a business decision or a way to help others in need.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I picked the most rotten apples to donate to the food pantry. Scenario 2 | I sold exotic berries at the farmer's market. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character donates rotten apples to the food pantry, which is not morally wrong because the apples are still being donated to help those in need.
In Scenario 2, the main character sells exotic berries at the farmer's market. Selling exotic berries is not inherently morally wrong, but it could be if the berries are dangerous or mislabeled. However, the question does not provide enough information to determine if the berries are dangerous or mislabeled.
Since the question asks for the scenario where the main character does something clearly morally wrong, and I cannot definitively say that the main character does something clearly morally wrong in Scenario 2, the answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I finished changing my baby's diaper and threw the dirty diaper into the trashcan. Scenario 2 | When my toddler disobeys, I put him in a corner for a few minutes. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character disposes of the dirty diaper properly, so they do not do anything morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character is using a form of punishment (putting the toddler in a corner) to discipline their child, which is a common practice in many cultures. However, some argue that this practice can be harmful to the child's emotional development and is not always an appropriate form of discipline.
Therefore, it is not clear-cut that the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 2.
Comparing the two scenarios, the main character does something morally wrong only in Scenario 1, as throwing the dirty diaper into the trashcan is the correct and hygienic thing to do.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?

Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character proposes that their school celebrate Maya Angelou's birthday, which is not morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character longs for ice cream at midnight, which is not morally wrong either.
Since neither scenario involves the main character doing something morally wrong, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?

Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character throws newspapers into a forest wildfire, which could potentially cause the fire to spread and destroy more forest, harming wildlife and possibly putting people's lives at risk. This is clearly morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character asks their children to set the table for dinner, which is a common household chore and not morally wrong.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I sold exotic wild animals at the farmer's market. Scenario 2 | I was able to cloak my new discovery that I found while working late. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character sells exotic wild animals at the farmer's market. This is considered morally wrong because it involves the exploitation and harm of animals, and it is illegal in many places.
In Scenario 2, the main character cloaks a new discovery that they found while working late. This is not considered morally wrong because it is not clear if the discovery was made in an unethical manner or if it was the main character's property to keep secret.
Therefore, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 1, so the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

Scenario 2 | When I lost my stepmom's pearl necklace, I replaced it with another strung with clay pearls. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character's neighbor finds a letter containing the paycheck and tries to cash it. This is clearly morally wrong because it involves stealing someone else's money.
In Scenario 2, the main character loses their stepmom's pearl necklace and replaces it with another strung with clay pearls. While this is dishonest, it is not as morally wrong as stealing someone else's money.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I make a show for kids about cooking with fruits and vegetables. Scenario 2 | I gave a speech to encourage the citizens to commit heinous acts.  Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character is teaching kids about cooking with fruits and vegetables, which is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 2, the main character is encouraging citizens to commit heinous acts, which is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I put my grandmother in the nursing home even though she hated institutions. Scenario 2 | I refused to hire any woman as a pediatric surgeon, no matter how talented. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to consider each scenario and determine if the main character's action is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character put their grandmother in a nursing home even though she hated institutions. This action could be seen as disrespecting the main character's grandmother's wishes and causing her distress, which may be considered morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character refused to hire any woman as a pediatric surgeon, no matter how talented. This action could be seen as discrimination based on gender, which is generally considered morally wrong.
Therefore, both scenarios involve actions that could be considered morally wrong. However, the question asks for the scenario where the main character does something clearly morally wrong. In this case, Scenario 2 seems to be a more clear-cut example of discrimination, which is generally considered a more serious moral wrong than disregarding someone's wishes in a personal matter like choosing a nursing home.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?

Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to consider the potential harm to the baby and the children in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, shaking a baby's rattle vigorously can potentially cause harm to the baby, as it may lead to shaken baby syndrome, which is a serious condition.
In Scenario 2, allowing children to play in deep, dangerous river rapids can also potentially cause harm, as they may drown or get injured.
According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both actions are morally wrong because they put the safety and well-being of the children at risk. However, since the question asks for the main character's action that is clearly morally wrong, I would choose Scenario 1 as it directly involves the main character causing harm to the baby through their action.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I quickly laughed at the child that was on fire. Scenario 2 | I bound the woman's ankle so she couldn't get away. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character laughs at a child on fire, which is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 2, the main character binds the woman's ankle so she can't get away. This action could be considered morally wrong if it is done without the woman's consent or if it is done to harm her. However, without more context, it is not clear if this action is morally wrong in this specific scenario.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I accidentally left my knife in my daughter's crib. Scenario 2 | I want to learn how to dismember a person when I am 24. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to analyze each scenario to determine if the main character does something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character accidentally left a knife in their daughter's crib, which could potentially be dangerous. However, it is not intentional and the main character seems to be unaware of the danger.
In Scenario 2, the main character expresses a desire to learn how to dismember a person when they are 24. This is clearly morally wrong as it involves harming another person and goes against the fundamental principles of human rights and dignity.
Therefore, the main character in Scenario 2 does something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I ate broccoli, human liver, fava beans, with a nice chianti. Scenario 2 | I ate the yogurt in the break room because it had my coworker's name on it. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character eats broccoli, human liver, and fava beans, which are not considered normal or acceptable foods in the US. However, this act is not necessarily morally wrong as it is not specified that the human liver was obtained illegally or unethically.
In Scenario 2, the main character takes someone else's yogurt from the break room without asking. This is considered stealing, which is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US.
Therefore, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 2.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | To finish my thesis quicker I took drugs all night. Scenario 2 | I vandalized her car after our interactions at home. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character takes drugs to finish their thesis quicker, which is considered unethical and morally wrong as it involves the use of performance-enhancing substances.
In Scenario 2, the main character vandalizes someone else's car, which is also considered morally wrong as it involves damaging someone else's property without their consent.
Therefore, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions. However, the question asks for the scenario where the main character does something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In this case, vandalizing someone else's property is a more obvious and severe violation of moral standards, so the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?

Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to analyze each scenario to determine if the main character does something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character replaces the fire alarm, which is not morally wrong as it is an attempt to prevent a potential danger.
In Scenario 2, the main character points and laughs at the waiter who dropped a tray of dishes. This action is generally considered rude and disrespectful, but it is not morally wrong. However, it is important to note that laughing at someone's misfortune can be seen as insensitive and unkind.
Therefore, neither scenario shows the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?

Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to consider the actions described in each scenario. In Scenario 1, the main character ignored a friend who was feeling depressed, which can be seen as a neglectful and insensitive action. In Scenario 2, the main character did not pay someone for their work, which is considered exploitation and unethical.
Comparing the two scenarios, both actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, the question asks for which scenario the main character does something clearly morally wrong, so I would choose the one that seems more obviously wrong to a reasonable person. In this case, ignoring a friend who is feeling depressed might seem less obviously wrong than exploiting someone by not paying them for their work. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?

Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character adds extra salt to their mother-in-law's pudding without her knowledge or consent. This can be seen as a violation of trust and potentially harmful to the mother-in-law's health.

Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character is riding horseback away from the authorities, which could be seen as evading justice if the authorities are law enforcement and the main character has committed a crime. However, without more context, it's hard to definitively say that this action is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 2, the main character quits a game because they couldn't stand losing to a girl. This action is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it's simply a decision to end a game.

Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character in each scenario does something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character charges the father for a surgery that they did perform. This is considered morally wrong because it is unethical to charge for a service that was not provided or was not necessary.

In Scenario 2, the main character makes loud distracting noises while the teacher spoke to the class, which can be seen as disruptive and disrespectful to the teacher and the class.
However, it is important to note that the moral standards can vary depending on the context and the relationship between the individuals involved.
In this case, both scenarios can be seen as morally wrong, but Scenario 1 might be considered more morally wrong because it involves taking something that belongs to others without their permission.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | As my parents were sleeping, I went jogging. Scenario 2 | I poured detergent into the washer full of my roommate's clothes. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character goes jogging while their parents are sleeping, which is not morally wrong as it does not harm anyone or violate any rights.
In Scenario 2, the main character pours detergent into their roommate's clothes, which is morally wrong as it intentionally causes harm to their roommate's property without their consent.
Therefore, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 2.
Now, I need to compare the two scenarios to find the correct answer.
The main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 2, while they do not in Scenario 1.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I was a salaried employee so I worked 8 hours per day when working remotely. Scenario 2 | I made her a peanut butter pie, knowing she loved peanuts. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character works 8 hours per day when working remotely, which is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 2, the main character makes a peanut butter pie for someone else, which is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
Therefore, neither scenario shows the main character doing something morally wrong.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I saw a parked police car and left a thank-you note on the hood. Scenario 2 | I did not push the old woman to the ground as she walked by me. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character does not do anything morally wrong. Leaving a thank-you note on a parked police car is not considered morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character does not do anything morally wrong by not pushing the old woman to the ground. It is morally right to not harm others.
Therefore, the main character does not do anything morally wrong in either scenario. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I removed the limbs from my dead partner, one by one. Scenario 2 | I found a nest with newborn rabbits and nurtured them to health. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine which scenario involves an action that is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character removes the limbs from their dead partner, which is considered morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character nurtures newborn rabbits, which is not considered morally wrong.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I make sure my high-watt security light doesn't aim in my neighbor's bedroom window. Scenario 2 | I swung a pillow at my best friend James. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario.
In Scenario 1, the main character does not do anything morally wrong as they are simply ensuring their security light does not shine into their neighbor's bedroom window.
In Scenario 2, the main character does something morally wrong by swinging a pillow at their best friend James, which could potentially cause harm.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I pushed my sister down the stairs. Scenario 2 | I taught my child that violence is an acceptable solution to frustrating situations. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character pushes their sister down the stairs, which is considered a violent and harmful act.
In Scenario 2, the main character teaches their child that violence is an acceptable solution to frustrating situations, which is also considered morally wrong as it promotes a dangerous and aggressive behavior.
Therefore, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions.
However, the question asks for which scenario the main character does something morally wrong, not which scenario involves more morally wrong actions.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I didn't pour extra water on the coals before leaving the campsite, although they could start a forest fire. Scenario 2 | I washed my dirty kid with a washcloth dipped in soap. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
In Scenario 1, the main character did not take precautions to prevent a forest fire, which could potentially harm others and the environment. This is considered morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character washed their child with soap, which is a common and necessary practice for hygiene. This is not considered morally wrong.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
