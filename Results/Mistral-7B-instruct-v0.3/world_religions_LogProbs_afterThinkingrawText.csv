First, I need to find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 1. The antiderivative is F(x) = (3/3)x^3 - (2/2)x^2 + x + C, where C is the constant of integration.
Next, I need to evaluate the antiderivative at the upper limit (x = 2) and the lower limit (x = 0). The antiderivative evaluated at x = 2 is F(2) = (3/3)2^3 - (2/2)2^2 + 2 + C, and the antiderivative evaluated at x = 0 is F(0) = (3/3)0^3 - (2/2)0^2 + 0 + C.
Now, I need to subtract the value of F(0) from the value of F(2) to find the definite integral. F(2) - F(0) = ((3/3)2^3 - (2/2)2^2 + 2) - ((3/3)0^3 - (2/2)0^2 + 0) = (12 - 4 + 2) - 0 = 10.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': '10'}."
