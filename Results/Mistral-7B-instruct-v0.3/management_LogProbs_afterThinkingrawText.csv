a) Complex and risky: Programmed decisions are not necessarily complex or risky, as they are based on predefined rules and do not require human judgment or decision-making.
b) Uncertain and non-routine: Programmed decisions are not uncertain, as they are based on predefined rules and do not require human judgment or decision-making. They are also not non-routine, as they follow a predefined set of rules.
c) Low risk and certain: Programmed decisions can be low risk, as they are based on predefined rules and do not require human judgment or decision-making. However, they are not always certain, as the outcome depends on the accuracy of the predefined rules.
d) Routine and non-complex: Programmed decisions are routine, as they follow a predefined set of rules. They are also non-complex, as they do not require human judgment or decision-making.
