"Input: A lesion causing compression of the facial nerve at the stylomastoid foramen will cause ipsilateral Choices: a) paralysis of the facial muscles. b) paralysis of the facial muscles and loss of taste. c) paralysis of the facial muscles, loss of taste and lacrimation. d) paralysis of the facial muscles, loss of taste, lacrimation and decreased salivation. 
Output:
First, I need to determine the effect of a lesion at the stylomastoid foramen on the facial nerve. The facial nerve controls the muscles of facial expression, as well as the muscles of the forehead, the muscles around the eyes, and the muscles of the lower face and neck.
The lesion will cause paralysis of the facial muscles, as the muscles controlled by the facial nerve will not be able to function properly.
However, the lesion does not directly affect the sense of taste or the glands that produce tears and saliva.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: A ""dished face"" profile is often associated with Choices: a) a protruding mandible due to reactivation of the condylar cartilage by acromegaly. b) a recessive maxilla due to failure of elongation of the cranial base. c) an enlarged frontal bone due to hydrocephaly. d) defective development of the maxillary air sinus. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the term ""dished face"" profile. It refers to a facial profile where the forehead appears to be pushed inward, creating a concave appearance.
Next, I need to consider the options given. The option that best fits the description of a ""dished face"" profile is a recessive maxilla due to failure of elongation of the cranial base. This condition would cause the forehead to appear concave, as the maxilla (upper jaw) is recessed.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Output:
First, I need to understand the impact of a broken neck at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra on the patient's ability to breathe. The sixth cervical vertebra is associated with the movement of the neck and shoulders, but it does not directly control the diaphragm, which is the main muscle responsible for breathing. However, damage to the spinal cord can affect the nerves that control the diaphragm, leading to difficulty breathing.
Next, I need to consider the choices given. a) They will be unable to breathe without life support: This is a possibility, but not a certainty, as the patient may be able to breathe with assistance. b) They will only be able to breathe quietly: This is also a possibility, as the patient may have reduced lung capacity or need assistance to breathe. c) It is impossible to predict an effect on breathing: This is not accurate, as the impact on breathing can be predicted based on the location of the injury and the severity of the damage. d) Breathing will be unaffected: This is not accurate, as the damage to the spinal cord at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra can potentially affect the patient's ability to breathe.

The choices are:
a) bilateral contraction of antigravity limb muscles: This would mean the contraction of muscles that oppose gravity in both limbs, which is not the case for voluntary movements.
b) bilateral contraction of limb musculature: This could be correct, as voluntary movements often involve both limbs.
c) contraction of ipsilateral limb musculature: This would mean the contraction of muscles on the same side of the body, which is not the case for voluntary movements that involve both limbs.
d) contraction of contralateral limb musculature: This would mean the contraction of muscles on the opposite side of the body, which is not the case for voluntary movements that involve both limbs.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: You notice that your patient's submandibular lymph nodes are enlarged. You would look for potential infection sites in the Choices: a) hard palate. b) hard palate and upper lip. c) hard palate, upper lip and upper central incisor. d) hard palate, upper lip, upper central incisor and lower first molar. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the areas that drain into the submandibular lymph nodes. These areas include the lower lip, lower teeth, and the floor of the mouth.
However, the question asks for potential infection sites, not just the areas that drain into the submandibular lymph nodes.
The hard palate and upper lip are not directly related to the lower teeth or the floor of the mouth, so they are not likely to be the primary sources of infection.
The upper central incisor is a tooth in the upper jaw, which is not directly related to the lower first molar, a tooth in the lower jaw.
Therefore, the most likely potential infection sites are the hard palate, upper lip, and upper central incisor.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

"Input: Laryngoscopic examination of the vocal folds after suspected recurrent laryngeal nerve damage usually shows that the vocal fold on the injured side is tensed and in an intermediate position between adduction and abduction. This is because Choices: a) cricothyroid muscle is still functional but the interarytenoid muscles are fully active. b) cricothyroid muscle is still functional but the interarytenoids are weak. c) cricothyroid muscle is paralyzed but the interarytenoids are fully active. d) cricothyroid muscle is paralyzed but the interarytenoids are weak. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the symptoms described in the question. The vocal fold on the injured side is tensed and in an intermediate position between adduction and abduction, which means it is not fully adducted (closed) or fully abducted (opened).
Next, I need to consider the possible causes for these symptoms. If the cricothyroid muscle is still functional, it would allow the vocal fold to adduct (close) more, but if the interarytenoid muscles are fully active, they would counteract the cricothyroid muscle's action and keep the vocal fold in an intermediate position.
However, if the cricothyroid muscle is paralyzed, it would not be able to adduct the vocal fold, but if the interarytenoid muscles are weak, they might not be able to counteract the paralysis fully, allowing the vocal fold to move slightly towards adduction (closing) but not fully.
Therefore, the correct answer is d) cricothyroid muscle is paralyzed but the interarytenoids are weak.

Input: A 100-gram sample of a substance is dissolved in 500 grams of water. What is the concentration of the substance in the solution?
Output:

Output:
First, I need to understand the growth and development of the mandible. The mental symphysis refers to the joining of the two mandibular bones at the lower front part of the jaw. It does not close at about 1 year postnatally, but rather during fetal development.
The condylar growth cartilage is responsible for the growth of the condyle, which is the rounded part of the mandible that articulates with the temporal bone of the skull. It does not cease activity at puberty, but rather continues to grow until the end of adolescence.
The ossification center appears about 8 weeks I.U.L (Intra-Uterine Life) medial to Meckel's cartilage, which is a cartilage that forms the lower part of the mandible.
The functional matrix acting on the angle of the mandible is the masseter muscle, not the lateral pterygoid muscle.
Therefore, the correct statement is a) The ossification center appears about 8 weeks I.U.L medial to Meckel's cartilage.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Which of the following statements is true of the pupillary light reflex? Choices: a) Its efferent limb is carried in the optic nerve b) It is mediated by the inferior colliculi in the midbrain c) It is a consensual reflex d) Its afferent limb is carried in the oculomotor nerve 
Output:
First, I need to understand the pupillary light reflex. It is a reflex that causes the pupil of the eye to constrict in response to light.
a) The efferent limb of a reflex is the part that carries the signal away from the brain to the effector, in this case, the muscles that constrict the pupil. The efferent limb of the pupillary light reflex is not carried in the optic nerve.
b) The inferior colliculi are part of the auditory system, not the visual system, so they are not involved in the pupillary light reflex.
c) A consensual reflex is one that occurs in one eye in response to a stimulus applied to the other eye. The pupillary light reflex is not a consensual reflex.
d) The afferent limb of a reflex is the part that carries the signal from the receptor to the brain. In the case of the pupillary light reflex, the afferent limb is carried in the optic nerve.
Therefore, the statement that is true of the pupillary light reflex is d) Its afferent limb is carried in the optic nerve.

First, I need to understand the condition given, which is medially directed strabismus or squint. This condition is characterized by the misalignment of the eyes, where one or both eyes turn inward.
Next, I need to consider the nerves that control the movement of the eyes. The oculomotor nerve (III) controls the movement of the eye up, down, and inward, while the trochlear nerve (IV) controls the movement of the eye outward. The ophthalmic trigeminal nerve (V1) is responsible for sensation in the eye, not movement.
Finally, the abducens nerve (VI) controls the movement of the eye outward. Since the patient's eye is turning inward, the damage is likely not to the abducens nerve.
Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is damage to the oculomotor nerve.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: A patient cuts a peripheral motor nerve in their wrist when they fall through a plate glass window. If the nerve does not regenerate, after about 6 months the muscles it normally innervates will show signs of which of the four options below? Choices: a) spastic paralysis b) flaccid paralysis c) atrophy d) contracture 
Output:
First, I need to understand the function of the peripheral motor nerve. It is responsible for transmitting signals from the brain to the muscles, causing them to contract.
If the nerve is cut and does not regenerate, the muscles it normally innervates will not receive the necessary signals to contract. This results in a loss of muscle function.
The options are: a) spastic paralysis (involuntary muscle spasms), b) flaccid paralysis (complete loss of muscle tone and control), c) atrophy (wasting away of the muscle due to disuse), and d) contracture (permanent shortening of a muscle or tendon).
Since the patient will lose muscle function but not necessarily have involuntary spasms or permanent shortening, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}.

First, I need to understand the effect of the damage to the left internal capsule on the motor neurons controlling the right leg. Damage to this area can cause paralysis, but the type of paralysis depends on the specific neurons affected.
In this case, the damage is to the motor neurons, which control voluntary muscle movements.
Spastic paralysis is characterized by increased muscle tone, hyperreflexia, and involuntary movements. Flaccid paralysis is characterized by decreased muscle tone, hyporeflexia, and lack of voluntary movements. Tremor is an involuntary, rhythmic muscle contraction.
Since the patient's leg will exhibit increased muscle tone, hyperreflexia, and involuntary movements, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: The crown of a very carious tooth suddenly fractures while the patient is standing eating at a take-away food outlet and a fragment is inhaled. It is more likely to enter the Choices: a) right lung because the right main bronchus is wider and more vertical than the left. b) left lung because the left main bronchus is wider and more vertical than the right. c) right lung or left lung because the two main bronchi are of equal size and at the same angulation. d) right or left lung because there are no factors predisposing to the fragment going in one particular direction. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the anatomy of the respiratory system. The right main bronchus is wider and more vertical than the left, but the left main bronchus is longer.
When a person is standing, gravity pulls objects downwards. Since the right main bronchus is more vertical, it is less affected by gravity compared to the longer and more horizontal left main bronchus.
Therefore, it is more likely for the inhaled fragment to enter the left lung because the left main bronchus is longer and more affected by gravity, causing the fragment to be pulled towards it.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

The leg I am trying to find is the one that is not 3 units long, so let's call it x. The hypotenuse is 4 units long, and the other leg is 3 units long, so we can set up the equation as follows: xยฒ + 3ยฒ = 4ยฒ.
Solving for x, we get xยฒ = 4ยฒ - 3ยฒ = 16 - 9 = 7.
Taking the square root of both sides, we get x = โ7.
Therefore, the length of the other leg is {'sol': 'โ7 units'}.

Input: A right triangle has a leg of 5 units and a hypotenuse of 12 units. What is the length of the other leg?

First, I need to use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg. The Pythagorean theorem states that aยฒ + bยฒ = cยฒ, where a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the length of the hypotenuse.
The leg I am trying to find is the one that is not 5 units long, so let's call it x. The hypotenuse is 12 units long, and the other leg is 5 units long, so we can set up the equation as follows: xยฒ + 5ยฒ = 12ยฒ.
Solving for x, we get xยฒ = 12ยฒ - 5ยฒ = 144 - 25 = 119.
Taking the square root of both sides, we get x = โ119.
Therefore, the length of the other leg is {'sol': 'โ119 units'}.
