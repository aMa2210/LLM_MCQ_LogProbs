"First, I need to calculate the total income generated from renting the limousine. If the limousine is rented for 2 hours a day at $245 per hour, the daily income is 2 * $245 = $490. 

Next, I calculate the annual income by multiplying the daily income by the number of days in a year: $490 * 365 = $178,850.

Now, I need to calculate the total annual costs. The daily costs are $50, so the annual costs are $50 * 365 = $18,250.

To find the net income, I subtract the total annual costs from the total annual income: $178,850 - $18,250 = $160,600.

Finally, to find the estimated yearly yield on the investment, I divide the net income by the initial investment and multiply by 100 to get a percentage: ($160,600 / $98,000) * 100 = 163.27%.

Therefore, the closest answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze the situation regarding the credit purchase of merchandise. Since the merchandise was included in the year-end physical inventory, it means that the assets (inventory) are correctly stated. 

Next, I need to consider the effect on liabilities. The omission of the credit purchase means that the accounts payable (liability) related to that purchase was not recorded. This results in an understatement of liabilities because the company owes money for the merchandise that was purchased but not recorded.

Finally, since the assets are correctly stated (the inventory is included), but the liabilities are understated (the accounts payable is not recorded), the overall effect on the balance sheet is that assets remain the same while liabilities are understated.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct statement about audit sampling risks for a nonissuer, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option a**: This statement discusses nonsampling risk and its implications when a substantive test is restricted to a sample. It correctly identifies that nonsampling risk arises from the possibility of different conclusions based on the sample versus the entire population. This statement is accurate.

2. **Option b**: This statement also addresses nonsampling risk, specifically mentioning the failure to recognize misstatements. This is indeed a valid point about nonsampling risk, as it can lead to incorrect conclusions regardless of the sample size.

3. **Option c**: This statement refers to sampling risk and its uncertainty in applying audit procedures. However, it does not clearly define what sampling risk is, which typically relates to the risk that the sample is not representative of the population. This statement is somewhat vague and less accurate.

4. **Option d**: This statement discusses sampling risk in the context of selecting inappropriate audit procedures. While it touches on an important aspect of audit procedures, it does not accurately reflect the definition of sampling risk, which is more about the representativeness of the sample rather than the appropriateness of the procedures.

After analyzing all options, options a and b are correct regarding nonsampling risk, but since the question asks for a statement about audit sampling risks, option c is the most relevant to that context.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand what subsequent events are. Subsequent events are events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued, and they can affect the financial statements.

Next, I will evaluate each option in relation to subsequent events:

a) Inspecting inventory items ordered before the year-end but arriving after the year-end does not directly relate to subsequent events, as it pertains to inventory valuation rather than events affecting the financial statements.

b) Testing internal control activities that were previously reported as inadequate is more about assessing the effectiveness of controls rather than addressing subsequent events.

c) Reviewing the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year-end is relevant because it helps the auditor assess whether transactions that occurred after the year-end are properly recorded in the financial statements.

d) Comparing the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited is useful for understanding trends but does not specifically address subsequent events.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate procedure an auditor would generally perform regarding subsequent events is option c.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the correct term used by the FASB for making changes to the Accounting Standards Codification. The FASB issues updates to the Codification through a specific type of document.

Next, I will consider the options provided:
a) Accounting Standards Updates - This is a known term used by the FASB for updates to the Codification.
b) Emerging Issues Task Force Releases - These are related to specific issues but not the primary method for updating the Codification.
c) Statements of Financial Accounting Standards - This term is outdated and not used for current updates.
d) Staff Technical Bulletins - These provide guidance but are not the main method for changes to the Codification.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is clearly option a, as it directly refers to the updates made by the FASB.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of the investment project, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Present Value (PV) of the cash inflows**: The project generates profits of $500 in year five and year ten. The formula for calculating the present value of a future cash flow is:
   \[
   PV = \frac{C}{(1 + r)^n}
   \]
   where \(C\) is the cash flow, \(r\) is the discount rate, and \(n\) is the year.

   - For year 5:
     \[
     PV_5 = \frac{500}{(1 + 0.10)^5} = \frac{500}{1.61051} \approx 310.46
     \]
   - For year 10:
     \[
     PV_{10} = \frac{500}{(1 + 0.10)^{10}} = \frac{500}{2.59374} \approx 192.30
     \]

2. **Sum the present values of the cash inflows**:
   \[
   Total\ PV = PV_5 + PV_{10} \approx 310.46 + 192.30 \approx 502.76
   \]

3. **Calculate the NPV**: The NPV is calculated by subtracting the initial investment from the total present value of cash inflows:
   \[
   NPV = Total\ PV - Initial\ Investment = 502.76 - 500 = 2.76
   \]

Since the NPV is approximately $2.76, which is closest to $3, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine how the error in amortization affects the bond carrying amount and retained earnings, I will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Amortization Methods**: The straight-line method spreads the premium evenly over the life of the bond, while the effective interest method amortizes the premium based on the carrying amount of the bond and the market interest rate. Using the straight-line method typically results in a different amortization amount compared to the effective interest method.

2. **Impact on Bond Carrying Amount**: Since Dean Co. used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method, the bond carrying amount would be higher than it should be at June 30 year 12. This is because the effective interest method would have amortized more of the premium in earlier periods, leading to a lower carrying amount.

3. **Impact on Retained Earnings**: The incorrect amortization would also affect the interest expense recognized in the income statement. If the premium is not amortized correctly, the interest expense would be understated, leading to overstated net income and, consequently, overstated retained earnings.

Based on these analyses, the bond carrying amount is overstated, and retained earnings are also overstated.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To find the price of the bond, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the annual coupon payment**: The bond pays 5% of its face value ($100), which means the annual coupon payment is 5% of $100 = $5.

2. **Calculate the present value of the coupon payments**: Since the bond pays $5 annually for 3 years, I will discount these payments back to the present value using the yield of 6%. The present value of the coupon payments can be calculated using the formula for the present value of an annuity:
   \[
   PV = C \times \left(1 - (1 + r)^{-n}\right) / r
   \]
   where \(C\) is the annual coupon payment ($5), \(r\) is the yield (0.06), and \(n\) is the number of years (3).
   \[
   PV = 5 \times \left(1 - (1 + 0.06)^{-3}\right) / 0.06
   \]
   \[
   PV = 5 \times \left(1 - (1.191016)^{-1}\right) / 0.06
   \]
   \[
   PV = 5 \times \left(1 - 0.839619\right) / 0.06
   \]
   \[
   PV = 5 \times 0.160381 / 0.06 \approx 13.365
   \]

3. **Calculate the present value of the face value**: The face value of the bond ($100) will be paid back at the end of 3 years, so I will discount it back to the present value using the yield of 6%:
   \[
   PV_{face} = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n} = \frac{100}{(1 + 0.06)^3} = \frac{100}{1.191016} \approx 84.03
   \]

4. **Calculate the total price of the bond**: The total price of the bond is the sum of the present value of the coupon payments and the present value of the face value:
   \[
   Price = PV_{coupons} + PV_{face} \approx 13.365 + 84.03 \approx 97.395
   \]

Now, rounding to two decimal places, the price of the bond is approximately $97.33.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which statement is incorrect regarding the old building, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Reclassification as an asset held for sale**: When a company intends to sell an asset and it meets certain criteria, it is reclassified as an asset held for sale. This statement is correct.

2. **Classification as a current asset**: An asset held for sale is typically classified as a current asset if it is expected to be sold within one year. Since the company expects to complete the sale in four months, this statement is also correct.

3. **No longer depreciated**: Once an asset is classified as held for sale, it is not depreciated. This statement is correct as well.

4. **Valued at historical cost**: When an asset is classified as held for sale, it is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Therefore, it is not necessarily valued at historical cost, making this statement incorrect.

Based on this analysis, the incorrect statement is option d.

Thus, the answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to determine how much income Carson would report if the corporation were an S corporation. In an S corporation, the income is passed through to the shareholders based on their ownership percentage, regardless of whether it is distributed as dividends.

Carson owns 40% of the corporation. Therefore, I will calculate 40% of the corporation's taxable income of $400,000:

40% of $400,000 = 0.40 * 400,000 = $160,000.

This amount represents the income that Carson would report on his individual tax return if the corporation were an S corporation.

Next, I note that the cash dividends distributed ($70,000) do not affect the income reported from the S corporation, as the income is recognized based on ownership percentage, not on distributions.

Thus, Carson would report $160,000 on his individual return if the corporation had been an S corporation.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the value of an investment that pays out a constant amount forever, we can use the formula for the present value of a perpetuity, which is:

\[ \text{Present Value} = \frac{C}{r} \]

where \( C \) is the annual cash flow and \( r \) is the discount rate.

1. In this case, the annual cash flow \( C \) is $10.
2. The market discount rate \( r \) is 5%, or 0.05 in decimal form.
3. Plugging these values into the formula gives:

\[ \text{Present Value} = \frac{10}{0.05} = 200 \]

Thus, the investment is worth $200.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to determine how much of the rental losses Smith can deduct based on his adjusted gross income (AGI) and the active participation in rental real estate activities. 

Smith has an AGI of $120,000. The IRS allows individuals who actively participate in rental real estate to deduct up to $25,000 of rental losses against their ordinary income, but this deduction begins to phase out when AGI exceeds $100,000. 

Since Smith's AGI is $120,000, which is $20,000 over the $100,000 threshold, the phase-out amount is calculated as follows: for every $2 of AGI over $100,000, the allowable deduction is reduced by $1. 

Smith's AGI exceeds the threshold by $20,000, which means the deduction is reduced by $10,000 ($20,000 / 2). Therefore, the maximum deduction of $25,000 is reduced to $15,000 ($25,000 - $10,000).

Thus, the amount of the rental losses that Smith may deduct in determining taxable income is $15,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the elements of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures specifically related to accounting and auditing practices. Quality control in this context typically includes aspects that ensure the firm meets professional standards and provides high-quality services.

Next, I will evaluate the options provided:

a) Engagement performance - This refers to how engagements are managed and executed, ensuring that they meet the required standards and are performed effectively. This is a key element of quality control.

b) Risk analysis - While important in many contexts, it is not specifically a quality control policy or procedure element in the context of accounting and auditing practices.

c) Safeguarding of assets - This is more related to internal controls and financial management rather than quality control policies specific to accounting and auditing.

d) Information processing - This refers to how information is handled and processed, but it does not directly relate to the quality control policies and procedures of a CPA firm.

Based on this analysis, the most relevant option that aligns with quality control policies and procedures in a CPA firm's accounting and auditing practice is engagement performance.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To calculate the direct labor rate variance, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the actual direct labor cost**: The company produced 9,000 units and paid $21 per hour for 2.5 hours per unit. Therefore, the actual direct labor cost is:
   \[
   \text{Actual Direct Labor Cost} = \text{Units Produced} \times \text{Hours per Unit} \times \text{Actual Rate}
   \]
   \[
   = 9,000 \times 2.5 \times 21 = 472,500
   \]

2. **Calculate the standard direct labor cost**: The standard direct labor cost for the actual production of 9,000 units is calculated using the standard wage of $20 per hour and the standard hours of 2.4 per unit:
   \[
   \text{Standard Direct Labor Cost} = \text{Units Produced} \times \text{Standard Hours per Unit} \times \text{Standard Rate}
   \]
   \[
   = 9,000 \times 2.4 \times 20 = 432,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the direct labor rate variance**: The direct labor rate variance is the difference between the actual direct labor cost and the standard direct labor cost:
   \[
   \text{Direct Labor Rate Variance} = \text{Actual Direct Labor Cost} - \text{Standard Direct Labor Cost}
   \]
   \[
   = 472,500 - 432,000 = 40,500
   \]

Thus, the company's direct labor rate variance for March is $40,500. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to determine the output gap, which is the difference between the full-employment GDP and the actual GDP. The output gap is $1.3 trillion - $1.2 trillion = $0.1 trillion, or $100 billion.

Next, I will use the formula for the spending multiplier, which is calculated as 1 / (1 - marginal propensity to consume). Given that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8, the spending multiplier is 1 / (1 - 0.8) = 1 / 0.2 = 5.

Now, to find the increase in government expenditures necessary to close the output gap, I divide the output gap by the spending multiplier: $100 billion / 5 = $20 billion.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which type of audit evidence provides the least assurance of reliability, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Receivable confirmations received from the client’s customers (a)**: This type of evidence is generally considered reliable because it comes directly from third parties (the customers) and is independent of the client.

2. **Prenumbered receiving reports completed by the client’s employees (b)**: While prenumbered reports can help ensure completeness, they are still prepared by the client’s employees, which may introduce bias or errors, making them less reliable than third-party confirmations.

3. **Prior months’ bank statements obtained from the client (c)**: These statements are typically reliable as they are issued by the bank, but since they are obtained from the client, there is a slight risk of manipulation or selective presentation.

4. **Municipal property tax bills prepared in the client’s name (d)**: These documents are prepared by a government entity, which adds a level of reliability. However, they are still related to the client and may not be as independently verifiable as third-party confirmations.

After evaluating all options, the least reliable evidence is likely the prenumbered receiving reports completed by the client’s employees, as they are internal documents and can be subject to manipulation.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the amount that should be capitalized as software cost, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the costs that can be capitalized according to accounting standards. Generally, costs incurred during the development phase after technological feasibility is established can be capitalized, while costs incurred before that are typically expensed.

2. In this case, the costs incurred for coding and testing to establish technological feasibility ($15,000) and the completion of detailed program design ($10,000) are considered as costs incurred before technological feasibility is established and should be expensed.

3. The only costs that can be capitalized are the other coding and testing costs incurred after the establishment of technological feasibility, which amount to $44,000.

Therefore, the total amount that should be capitalized as software cost in Pipp's December 31 year 2 balance sheet is $44,000.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the situation regarding the financial statements and the departure from GAAP. The accountant has identified that management has stated land at appraised value instead of historical cost, which is a departure from GAAP. This departure has a material effect on both the land account and stockholders' equity.

Next, since the accountant has decided to modify the standard compilation report due to management's refusal to revise the financial statements, the appropriate action is to disclose the departure from GAAP and its effects on the financial statements. This is important for transparency and to inform users of the financial statements about the implications of the accounting treatment.

Finally, the best choice among the options provided is to add a separate paragraph to the accountant's report that discloses the departure from GAAP and its effects on the financial statements. This approach maintains the integrity of the report while informing users of the significant issue.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine how the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose arises under the UCC, I will analyze the options step by step.

First, the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose is established when the buyer has a specific purpose for the goods and relies on the seller's expertise to provide suitable goods. This means that the seller must have knowledge of the buyer's intended use.

Next, I will evaluate the options:
- Option a) states that the buyer is relying on the seller’s skill or judgment, but it does not mention whether the seller knows the particular purpose.
- Option b) mentions that the seller is a merchant, but it does not specify that the seller knows the buyer's particular purpose or that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill.
- Option c) indicates that the seller knows the particular purpose and that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill, which aligns with the requirements for the implied warranty.
- Option d) states that the seller knows the purpose and is a merchant, but it does not explicitly mention the reliance of the buyer on the seller's skill.

Finally, the best description of how the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose arises is option c), as it captures both the seller's knowledge of the buyer's purpose and the buyer's reliance on the seller's expertise.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which condition most likely raises questions about the integrity of management, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option a**: Significant differences between the entity's forecasted financial statements and the financial statements to be audited could indicate that management is not being realistic or honest about the company's performance. This discrepancy may suggest potential manipulation or misrepresentation of financial results.

2. **Option b**: The CPA not being permitted access to sensitive information regarding the salaries of senior management could raise concerns, but it does not directly indicate a lack of integrity. It may simply be a matter of confidentiality or company policy.

3. **Option c**: Substantial inventory write-offs just before the year-end in each of the past four years is a strong indicator of potential issues. This pattern may suggest that management is trying to manipulate earnings or hide losses, which raises significant questions about their integrity.

4. **Option d**: The existence of related party transactions is a red flag, but it does not inherently indicate a lack of integrity. Related party transactions can be legitimate if disclosed properly, although they do require careful scrutiny.

After evaluating all options, option c stands out as the most concerning regarding management's integrity due to the repeated pattern of substantial inventory write-offs, which could indicate financial manipulation.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the requirements of an e-commerce environment, which demands high availability and minimal downtime. This means that the IT system must be designed to handle continuous operations without interruptions.

Next, I will evaluate the options provided:
a) Maintaining appropriate written source documents is important for data recovery, but it does not directly address continuous availability.
b) Maintaining redundant systems is crucial for ensuring that if one system fails, another can take over immediately, thus assuring the flow of transactions.
c) Reviewing additional expenses for business interruption insurance is relevant but does not directly contribute to the immediate availability of the IT system.
d) Storing data backups off-site is important for disaster recovery, but it does not ensure instant availability.

Based on this analysis, the most critical aspect for ensuring continuous availability in an e-commerce environment is maintaining redundant systems.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to determine the selling price and the cost per unit. The selling price is $200, and the cost of each phone is $125. The sales commission is $25, so the total cost per unit sold is $125 + $25 = $150.

Next, I calculate the profit per unit sold. The profit per unit is the selling price minus the total cost per unit: $200 - $150 = $50.

Now, I need to find out the total sales needed to achieve a profit of 10%. Let’s denote the number of units sold as \( x \). The total sales revenue from selling \( x \) units is \( 200x \). The desired profit is 10% of total sales, which is \( 0.10 \times 200x = 20x \).

The total costs include the fixed costs of $3000 and the variable costs of $150 per unit sold, which is \( 150x + 3000 \).

To find the break-even point where profit equals the desired profit, I set up the equation:

Total Revenue - Total Costs = Desired Profit
\[ 200x - (150x + 3000) = 20x \]

Now, simplifying the equation:
\[ 200x - 150x - 3000 = 20x \]
\[ 50x - 3000 = 20x \]
\[ 50x - 20x = 3000 \]
\[ 30x = 3000 \]
\[ x = 100 \]

Therefore, Spark must sell 100 units to achieve a profit of 10% of sales. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine how inherent risk and control risk differ from detection risk, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Understanding the Risks**: Inherent risk and control risk are types of risks that exist before an audit is conducted, while detection risk is the risk that the auditor will not detect a material misstatement. Inherent and control risks are related to the entity and its environment, while detection risk is related to the audit procedures.

2. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - **Option a**: ""Inherent risk and control risk are calculated by the client."" This is incorrect because these risks are assessed by the auditor, not calculated by the client.
   - **Option b**: ""Inherent risk and control risk exist independently of the audit."" This is correct because these risks are inherent to the entity and its environment, while detection risk is specifically related to the audit process.
   - **Option c**: ""Inherent risk and control risk are controlled by the auditor."" This is incorrect; the auditor assesses these risks but does not control them.
   - **Option d**: ""Inherent risk and control risk exist as a result of the auditor’s judgment about materiality."" This is misleading; while the auditor's judgment affects the assessment of these risks, they exist independently of the auditor's judgment.

3. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the correct distinction is that inherent risk and control risk exist independently of the audit, while detection risk is directly related to the audit process.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the cost of goods sold (COGS) using the LIFO (Last In, First Out) method, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total units available for sale**: 
   - Beginning inventory: 20,000 units
   - Purchases: 30,000 units + 40,000 units = 70,000 units
   - Total units available = 20,000 + 70,000 = 90,000 units.

2. **Determine the units sold**: 
   - Sales during January = 50,000 units.

3. **Calculate COGS using LIFO**: 
   - Under LIFO, we sell the most recently purchased inventory first.
   - The last purchase was 40,000 units at $17 each, so COGS from this batch = 40,000 * $17 = $680,000.
   - Next, we sell 10,000 units from the previous purchase of 30,000 units at $15 each, so COGS from this batch = 10,000 * $15 = $150,000.
   - Total COGS = $680,000 + $150,000 = $830,000.

Therefore, the amount Ultra should report as cost of goods sold on its income statement for the month of January is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine whether a contract was formed under the Sales Article of the UCC, I will analyze the timeline and the rules regarding offer, acceptance, and revocation.

1. **Offer and Acceptance**: Jackson made an offer to Sands on day 1, which Sands received on day 3. Sands accepted the offer by mailing a response on day 7. According to the mailbox rule, an acceptance is effective when sent, not when received.

2. **Revocation of Offer**: Jackson mailed a revocation of the offer on day 4, which Sands received on day 6. However, since Sands mailed his acceptance on day 7, we need to consider whether the revocation was effective before Sands' acceptance was sent.

3. **Timing of Acceptance and Revocation**: The key point is that Sands' acceptance was mailed on day 7, which is after Jackson's revocation was mailed on day 4 but before it was received by Sands on day 6. Since Sands sent his acceptance after the revocation was mailed but before it was received, the acceptance is valid under the mailbox rule.

Based on this analysis, a contract was formed when Sands mailed his acceptance on day 7, as the revocation was not effective until received by Sands.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to determine the vacation liability that Elan Co. should report. Each employee is entitled to two weeks of paid vacation, which means that the company has a liability for the vacation time that has been earned but not taken.

For the employee who took a two-week vacation, the company will not have a liability for that vacation time since it has already been used. However, for the employee who did not take any vacation, the company has a liability for the two weeks of vacation that they have earned.

The second employee earns $800 per week, so the liability for their unused vacation is:
$800 (weekly salary) * 2 (weeks) = $1600.

Next, I need to calculate the vacation expense for the year. The expense includes the vacation taken by the first employee. Since the first employee took a two-week vacation at a weekly salary of $600, the expense for that vacation is:
$600 (weekly salary) * 2 (weeks) = $1200.

Now, I can summarize the findings:
- Total vacation liability: $1600 (for the second employee).
- Total vacation expense: $1200 (for the first employee).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze each statement regarding the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA):

a) An employee who resigns regardless of cause is eligible for unemployment benefits. - This statement is incorrect because generally, employees who voluntarily resign are not eligible for unemployment benefits unless they can prove they had a good cause for leaving.

b) The federal unemployment system is funded by both employer and employee taxes. - This statement is also incorrect. The FUTA is primarily funded by employer taxes; employees do not contribute to the federal unemployment tax.

c) The Act is intended to assist workers who are permanently out of work and need assistance in supporting themselves. - This statement is misleading. The Act is designed to assist workers who are temporarily unemployed, not those who are permanently out of work.

d) The unemployment insurance system is administered by the states through their employment laws. - This statement is correct. While the federal government provides guidelines and funding, the administration of unemployment insurance is handled by individual states.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to determine the total gain from the sale of the land. The land was sold for $160,000, and Acre's tax basis in the land was $60,000. Therefore, the total gain from the sale is $160,000 - $60,000 = $100,000.

Next, I need to consider how the gain is allocated among the partners. Since Acre contributed the land to the partnership, the gain from the sale of the land is typically allocated to Acre first, up to the amount of the built-in gain (the difference between the fair market value and the tax basis). Acre's built-in gain is $100,000 (fair market value of $100,000 - tax basis of $60,000).

Since the total gain from the sale is $100,000, which matches Acre's built-in gain, the entire gain is allocated to Acre.

Finally, I need to confirm the options provided. The correct treatment is that the entire gain of $100,000 must be specifically allocated to Acre.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze the purpose of establishing quality control policies and procedures in the context of client relationships. The primary goal is to ensure that the firm does not engage with clients that may pose a risk to its integrity or reputation.

Next, I will evaluate each option:
a) While training personnel is important, it does not directly relate to the decision of accepting or continuing a client relationship.
b) This option directly addresses the concern of associating with clients whose management may lack integrity, which is a key reason for implementing quality control policies.
c) Documenting matters for the audit committee is important but is more about communication than the initial decision-making process regarding client relationships.
d) Enhancing understanding of the client's business is beneficial but does not specifically address the integrity of the client’s management.

Based on this analysis, the most relevant option that aligns with the purpose of quality control policies in client relationships is option b.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To find the price of a zero-coupon bond, I will use the present value formula for bonds. The price of a zero-coupon bond can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Price} = \frac{\text{Face Value}}{(1 + r)^n} \]

where:
- Face Value = $100
- r = yield (4% or 0.04)
- n = number of years until maturity (5 years)

Step 1: Substitute the values into the formula.

\[ \text{Price} = \frac{100}{(1 + 0.04)^5} \]

Step 2: Calculate \( (1 + 0.04)^5 \).

\[ (1 + 0.04)^5 = 1.04^5 \approx 1.21665 \]

Step 3: Now calculate the price.

\[ \text{Price} = \frac{100}{1.21665} \approx 82.19 \]

Since the price of the bond is approximately $82.19, the closest answer choice is c) $82.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine Vital Corp.'s year 2 taxable income as reconciled on Schedule M-1 of Form 1120, I will follow these steps:

1. **Start with the reported book income**: The book income before federal income taxes is $500,000.

2. **Adjust for non-taxable income**: The municipal bond interest income of $7,500 is not taxable, so I need to subtract this amount from the book income. 
   - Adjusted income = $500,000 - $7,500 = $492,500.

3. **Adjust for state tax refunds**: The state franchise tax refund of $50,000 is included in the book income but is not taxable for federal income tax purposes. Therefore, I need to subtract this amount as well.
   - Final taxable income = $492,500 - $50,000 = $442,500.

Thus, the amount of Vital's year 2 taxable income as reconciled on Schedule M-1 is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify the nature of the engagement. The practitioner is engaged to express an opinion on management's assertion regarding the square footage of a warehouse, which indicates that this is an attestation engagement rather than an audit or consulting service.

Next, I should consider the relevant professional guidance for attestation engagements. The appropriate source for guidance in this context would be the Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE), which provide the framework for practitioners to evaluate and report on assertions made by management.

Finally, I can eliminate the other options: Statements on Auditing Standards pertain to audits, Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services relate to financial statement reviews, and Statements on Standards for Consulting Services are not applicable here.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which segments require separate disclosure, we need to apply the quantitative thresholds set by accounting standards (such as IFRS 8 or ASC 280). Typically, a segment must be disclosed if it meets any of the following criteria:

1. Its reported revenue is 10% or more of the total revenue of all segments.
2. Its reported profit or loss is 10% or more of the greater of:
   - The total profit of all segments that reported a profit, or
   - The absolute value of the total loss of all segments that reported a loss.
3. Its assets are 10% or more of the total assets of all segments.

Now, let's analyze the data provided:

1. **Total Revenue**: $177,000
   - Segment A: $42,000 (42/177 = 23.7%)
   - Segment B: $121,000 (121/177 = 68.4%)
   - Segment C: $14,000 (14/177 = 7.9%)

   Segments A and B meet the revenue criterion.

2. **Total Profit**: $74,000 (only segments A and B reported profit)
   - Segment A: $12,000 (12/74 = 16.2%)
   - Segment B: $65,000 (65/74 = 87.8%)
   - Segment C: $(3,000) (loss)

   Segments A and B meet the profit criterion.

3. **Total Assets**: $1,350,000
   - Segment A: $470,000 (470/1350 = 34.8%)
   - Segment B: $800,000 (800/1350 = 59.3%)
   - Segment C: $80,000 (80/1350 = 5.9%)

   Segments A and B meet the asset criterion.

Based on the analysis, segments A and B meet the criteria for separate disclosure, while segment C does not meet any of the criteria.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the implications of a change in accounting principles and its materiality. If the change is not material, it means that it does not significantly affect the users' understanding of the financial statements.

Next, I consider the auditor's responsibilities in this situation. Generally, if the change is not material, the auditor does not need to draw attention to it in the auditor's report, as it does not impact the overall fairness of the financial statements.

Finally, I evaluate the options provided. Since the change is not material, the auditor should not refer to it in the report, as it does not warrant special attention.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze the situation regarding Long's authority as an agent. Long had express authority to place orders on behalf of Frost, but this authority typically ceases when the principal (Frost) becomes incompetent. 

Next, I consider the implications of Frost's incompetence. Since Frost was declared incompetent in a judicial proceeding, Long's authority to act on Frost's behalf would have been revoked, meaning Long could not legally bind Frost to any new contracts after that point.

Finally, I evaluate the relationship between Grant and Long. Although both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence, the law generally protects the principal from unauthorized actions taken by an agent after the principal's capacity to contract has been revoked. Therefore, Grant cannot hold Frost or Frost's legal representative liable for the order placed by Long after Frost's incompetence was established.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To assess an internal auditor's competence, an external auditor should consider several factors. 

First, the educational level and professional experiences of the internal auditor (choice b) are crucial as they directly relate to the auditor's qualifications and ability to perform their duties effectively. 

Second, the reporting status of the internal auditor within the organization (choice a) is also important because it can influence the auditor's independence and objectivity, which are essential for competence.

Third, understanding whether the board of directors, audit committee, or owner-manager oversees employment decisions related to the internal auditor (choice d) can provide insight into the governance structure and support for the internal auditor's role, which can impact their effectiveness.

While choice c, regarding policies prohibiting the internal auditor from auditing areas where relatives are employed, is relevant to independence, it is not as directly related to assessing competence as the other factors.

Therefore, the most relevant factors for assessing competence are choices a, b, and d. However, since the question asks for updated information specifically about competence, the best choice is b.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which procedure an auditor would most likely perform before the balance sheet date, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option a**: Confirming with the client's lawyer about litigation is typically done to ensure that all potential liabilities are disclosed. However, this is often done closer to the balance sheet date or during the audit process rather than before it.

2. **Option b**: Obtaining an understanding of the client's internal control activities is a preliminary step in the audit process. This is usually done at the beginning of the audit, before the balance sheet date, to assess the risk of material misstatement.

3. **Option c**: Determining liens or encumbrances on assets is important for assessing the financial position of the company, but this is generally done during the audit fieldwork rather than strictly before the balance sheet date.

4. **Option d**: Considering the client's plans and ability to meet commitments is more of a substantive procedure that would typically occur during the audit, rather than strictly before the balance sheet date.

Based on this analysis, the most likely procedure an auditor would perform before the balance sheet date is obtaining an understanding of the client's internal control activities.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to determine the expected return of the equal weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C. Since the portfolio is equally weighted, each security will have a weight of 0.5 (or 50%).

Next, I will calculate the expected return of the portfolio using the formula for the expected return of a portfolio:

Expected Return = (Weight of A * Return of A) + (Weight of C * Return of C)

Substituting the values:

Expected Return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)

Calculating this gives:

Expected Return = (0.5 * 0.07) + (0.5 * 0.05) = 0.035 + 0.025 = 0.06 or 6%.

Therefore, the expected return of the equal weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is 6%.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To find the component cost of preferred stock for Lei-Feng, Inc., I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the dividend yield**: The preferred stock pays a $10 annual dividend, and the current market price is $96. The dividend yield can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Dividend Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividend}}{\text{Current Market Price}} = \frac{10}{96} \approx 0.1042 \text{ or } 10.42\%
   \]

2. **Consider the tax implications**: Preferred stock dividends are not tax-deductible, so the marginal tax rate does not affect the cost of preferred stock. Therefore, the cost of preferred stock remains the same as the dividend yield.

3. **Select the closest option**: The calculated cost of preferred stock is approximately 10.42%, which is closest to the option d) 10.4%.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine how Poplar City should report the expenditures, I will analyze the payments made and the funds involved.

1. The city paid $5000 in interest and $20000 in principal on its bonds, totaling $25000 in expenditures.
2. The payment was made from a debt service fund, which is specifically used for paying off debt obligations, including interest and principal.
3. The cash for this payment was transferred from the general fund to the debt service fund earlier in the year. However, the actual expenditure for the payment is recorded in the debt service fund.

Now, I will categorize the expenditures:
- The general fund does not report any expenditures related to the bond payments since the payment was made from the debt service fund.
- The debt service fund will report the total payment of $25000, which includes both the interest and principal.
- The permanent fund is not involved in this transaction.

Based on this analysis, the correct reporting of expenditures is:
- General fund: $0
- Debt service fund: $25000
- Permanent fund: $0

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to determine the gain on the exchange of the land for the machinery. The gain is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the asset received (machinery) and the book value of the asset given up (land).

1. The fair value of the machinery received is $55,000.
2. The book value of the land given up is its original cost, which is $20,000.
3. The gain on the exchange is calculated as follows: Gain = Fair Value of Machinery - Book Value of Land = $55,000 - $20,000 = $35,000.

Since the transaction has commercial substance, the gain is recognized.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of the investment project, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Present Value (PV) of the future cash inflow**: The future cash inflow is $2 million, which will be received in 5 years. The formula for calculating the present value is:
   \[
   PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n}
   \]
   where \(FV\) is the future value ($2 million), \(r\) is the discount rate (10% or 0.10), and \(n\) is the number of years (5). 
   \[
   PV = \frac{2,000,000}{(1 + 0.10)^5} = \frac{2,000,000}{1.61051} \approx 1,240,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the NPV**: The NPV is calculated by subtracting the initial investment from the present value of the future cash inflow:
   \[
   NPV = PV - Initial\ Investment
   \]
   The initial investment is $1 million.
   \[
   NPV = 1,240,000 - 1,000,000 = 240,000
   \]

3. **Select the closest answer**: The calculated NPV is approximately $240,000, which corresponds to the choice provided.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the implications of Royal being adjudicated mentally incompetent. When a person is declared mentally incompetent, they are generally unable to enter into contracts, which can affect their obligations under a note.

Next, since Brown cosigned the note, he is considered a surety for Royal's debt. If Royal is no longer liable due to his incompetency, it raises questions about Brown's liability. 

Now, I need to consider the options:
- Option a suggests that Brown is still liable regardless of Royal's status, which may not be correct since Royal's incompetency could discharge him.
- Option b implies that Brown's liability is contingent on the bank seeking payment from Royal first, which is a common practice in surety agreements.
- Option c states that Brown is not liable because Royal's incompetency discharges him as a surety, which aligns with the principle that a surety's obligation can be affected by the principal's incapacity.
- Option d suggests that Brown's liability depends on whether he was compensated, which is not typically a factor in determining liability in this context.

Considering these points, the most accurate answer is that Brown is not liable to pay State because Royal's incompetency discharges Royal as a surety. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to determine when the company starts incurring rental expenses related to the operating lease. The rental payments begin on July 1, which is when the company is contractually obligated to pay rent.

Next, I consider the timeline of events: the company enters the lease on January 1, begins alterations on March 1, and moves in on May 1. However, the rental expense is recognized when the company is obligated to make payments, which is on July 1.

Finally, since the rental payments start in July, the recognition of rental expense should also begin in July.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze each option to determine which circumstance would most likely raise suspicion of material misstatements in financial statements.

a) Unusual discrepancies between the entity's records and confirmation replies could indicate that the records are not accurate or that there is manipulation, which would raise suspicion of misstatements.

b) Strict budgetary controls enforced by management may actually reduce the risk of misstatements, as they promote accountability and oversight.

c) Cash transactions being electronically processed and recorded without a paper audit trail could lead to concerns about the ability to verify transactions, but it does not directly indicate misstatements.

d) The presence of several large outstanding checks in the monthly bank reconciliation could suggest issues with cash management or potential misstatements, but it is not as direct as option a.

After evaluating these options, option a stands out as the most likely circumstance that would cause an auditor to suspect material misstatements due to the clear indication of discrepancies.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the situation regarding the insurance contract and the designation of beneficiaries. The taxpayer owns the insurance contract and has designated two children as equal beneficiaries. 

Next, for gift tax purposes, a gift occurs when a taxpayer transfers property to another without receiving something of equal value in return. In this case, the taxpayer is making premium payments for the insurance policy, which benefits the children as beneficiaries.

Now, since the taxpayer has designated two children as equal beneficiaries, each child is considered to receive a gift of the insurance policy's value upon the taxpayer's death. Therefore, there are two separate gifts made to each child.

Thus, the total number of gifts of property made for gift tax purposes is two. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the nature of the land donation. The land donated by the local farmer is intended for the construction of windmills, which are a long-term asset for the city. This suggests that the land should be reported in a fund that deals with capital assets.

Next, I consider the options provided. A ""Capital projects"" fund is typically used for the acquisition or construction of major capital facilities, which aligns with the purpose of the land being used for windmills. 

The ""Special revenue"" fund is used for resources that are restricted for specific purposes, which does not apply here since the land is a donation and not a revenue source. The ""Enterprise"" fund is used for operations that are financed and operated in a manner similar to private business enterprises, which is not relevant for the land itself. Lastly, the ""Permanent"" fund is used for resources that are legally restricted to the extent that only earnings, not principal, may be used for purposes that support the government's programs.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate fund type for reporting the donated land is the ""Capital projects"" fund.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to determine the gain Decker made from the sale of his principal residence. The gain is calculated by subtracting the cost basis from the net selling price. 

The net selling price is $500,000 and the cost basis is $200,000. Therefore, the gain is:
$500,000 - $200,000 = $300,000.

Next, I need to consider the tax implications of this gain. Since Decker is 62 years old and has owned and lived in the house for at least 2 of the last 5 years, he qualifies for the exclusion of gain on the sale of a principal residence. The exclusion allows individuals aged 55 and older to exclude up to $250,000 of gain from the sale of their principal residence.

Since Decker's gain is $300,000, he can exclude $250,000 of that gain. Therefore, the amount of gain he should recognize is:
$300,000 - $250,000 = $50,000.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the characteristics of cumulative preferred stock. Cumulative preferred stock typically provides that if dividends are not paid in any year, they accumulate and must be paid out before any dividends can be paid to common stockholders.

Next, I will analyze the options provided:
a) Conversion of the preferred stock into common stock - This is not a guaranteed right for cumulative preferred stockholders; it depends on the terms of the stock.
b) Voting rights - Preferred stockholders generally do not have voting rights unless specified, so this is not a guaranteed right.
c) Dividend carryovers from years in which dividends were not paid - This is a defining feature of cumulative preferred stock, as unpaid dividends accumulate.
d) Guaranteed dividends - While cumulative preferred stock accumulates unpaid dividends, it does not guarantee dividends will be paid in any given year.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that a holder of cumulative preferred stock is always entitled to dividend carryovers from years in which dividends were not paid.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the roles and restrictions placed on members of an issuer's audit committee according to SEC regulations. 

1. **Option a** states that audit committee members may establish procedures for employees to anonymously report fraud. This is generally allowed and is a common practice to encourage reporting of unethical behavior.

2. **Option b** mentions that audit committee members can be responsible for the compensation of any registered public accounting firm employed by the registrant. This is typically a responsibility of the audit committee, so this option is not a restriction.

3. **Option c** states that audit committee members may not accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the registrant for services other than as a member of the board. This is indeed a restriction placed on audit committee members to maintain independence.

4. **Option d** indicates that audit committee members can engage independent counsel as deemed necessary to carry out their duties. This is also allowed and is a common practice for audit committees.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that members of an issuer’s audit committee may not accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the registrant for services other than as a member of the board.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To order the (risk, return) pairs from least to most favorable for a rational and risk-averse investor, I will analyze the pairs based on their risk (standard deviation) and return (percentage).

1. **Understanding the pairs**:
   - (2,2): Risk = 2, Return = 2%
   - (2,3): Risk = 2, Return = 3%
   - (4,2): Risk = 4, Return = 2%

2. **Evaluating the pairs**:
   - The pair (2,2) has a lower return for the same risk as (2,3), making (2,3) more favorable than (2,2).
   - The pair (4,2) has a higher risk (4) but the same return (2%) as (2,2). Since a rational and risk-averse investor prefers lower risk for the same return, (4,2) is less favorable than (2,2).
   - Therefore, we can rank the pairs based on their returns while considering their risks.

3. **Ranking the pairs**:
   - (2,3) is the most favorable because it has the highest return for the same risk as (2,2).
   - (2,2) is next because it has a lower risk than (4,2) for the same return.
   - (4,2) is the least favorable due to its higher risk with the same return as (2,2).

Thus, the order from least to most favorable is: (4,2), (2,2), (2,3).

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the increase in Sussman's cash-basis income when restating to the accrual basis, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify Cash-Basis Income**: Under cash-basis accounting, Sussman recognizes income only when cash is received. For January, the cash collections from credit sales are $1,900. Therefore, the cash-basis income is $1,900.

2. **Adjust for Accrued Income**: Under the accrual basis, Sussman would recognize all credit sales made during January, which amount to $5,600. This means that the income recognized under the accrual basis would be $5,600.

3. **Adjust for Accrued Expenses**: The accrued salaries of $1,200 are expenses that would reduce the income under the accrual basis. Therefore, the net income under the accrual basis would be $5,600 (credit sales) - $1,200 (accrued salaries) = $4,400.

4. **Calculate the Increase in Income**: The increase in income when moving from cash-basis to accrual-basis is calculated as follows: $4,400 (accrual basis income) - $1,900 (cash basis income) = $2,500.

Thus, the amount by which Sussman's cash-basis income for the month ended January 31 will increase as a result of restating these activities to the accrual basis of accounting is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the COSO framework for monitoring internal control. COSO outlines a structured approach that includes establishing a foundation for monitoring, designing and executing monitoring procedures, and assessing and reporting results.

Next, I will analyze each option to determine which one does not align with the COSO monitoring steps. 

- Option a) ""Establishing a foundation for monitoring"" is indeed a step in the COSO framework.
- Option b) ""Increasing the reliability of financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations"" is more of an outcome rather than a step in the monitoring process.
- Option c) ""Designing and executing monitoring procedures that are prioritized based on risks to achieve organizational objectives"" is a valid step in the monitoring process.
- Option d) ""Assessing and reporting the results, including following up on corrective action where necessary"" is also a recognized step in the monitoring process.

Based on this analysis, option b does not fit as a step in the monitoring process according to COSO.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the bond interest expense for the year ended December 31, year 1, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the interest payment dates: The bond pays interest on April 1 and October 1. Since the bond was issued on June 1, year 1, the first interest payment will not occur until October 1, year 1.

2. Calculate the period for which interest is accrued: From the issuance date (June 1) to the first interest payment date (October 1) is a period of 4 months. After the first payment, the next interest payment will be on April 1 of the following year, which means that the interest expense for the year ended December 31, year 1, will only include the interest accrued from June 1 to December 31.

3. Determine the total period for interest expense: The interest expense for the year ended December 31, year 1, will cover the period from June 1 to December 31, which is 7 months (June, July, August, September, October, November, December).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate each option in the context of financial statement audits. 

Option a states that tests of details typically provide a low level of assurance. This is misleading because tests of details generally provide a higher level of assurance compared to other types of tests.

Option b claims that analytical procedures are an inefficient means of obtaining assurance. This is not accurate, as analytical procedures can be quite efficient and effective in certain contexts.

Option c suggests that the procedures to be applied on a particular engagement are a matter of the auditor’s professional judgment. This is true, as auditors must use their judgment to determine the appropriate tests based on the specific circumstances of the audit.

Option d states that the use of tests of controls should be considered without regard to the level of assurance required. This is incorrect because the level of assurance is a critical factor in deciding the nature of tests.

After evaluating all options, the most accurate statement is option c. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the implications of Stone selling his entire interest to Taylor. In a partnership, a change in ownership can lead to the termination of the partnership for tax purposes if the ownership structure changes significantly.

Next, I will analyze the ownership percentages before and after the sale. Initially, the ownership was:
- Ross: 15%
- Stone: 35%
- Taylor: 50%

After Stone sells his 35% interest to Taylor, the new ownership percentages will be:
- Ross: 15%
- Taylor: 50% + 35% = 85%

Now, Taylor holds 85% of the partnership, and Ross holds 15%. Since Taylor now has a controlling interest, the partnership structure has changed, but it does not necessarily mean that the partnership has terminated.

Finally, I need to determine if the partnership is considered terminated. According to tax regulations, a partnership is generally considered terminated if there is a change in ownership that results in a new partnership being formed. However, in this case, since Taylor and Ross are still in partnership, and the partnership continues to operate, it does not terminate.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the key characteristics of the just-in-time (JIT) approach compared to traditional manufacturing methods. JIT focuses on reducing inventory levels and increasing efficiency by receiving goods only as they are needed in the production process.

Next, I will analyze the options provided:
a) This statement is incorrect because JIT typically relies on a smaller number of suppliers to ensure quality and reliability, while traditional methods may use more suppliers.
b) This statement is also incorrect; JIT encourages decentralized purchasing decisions to allow for flexibility and responsiveness.
c) This statement is incorrect as well; JIT uses a pull-through system, where production is based on demand, while traditional methods often use a push-through system, producing goods based on forecasts.
d) This statement is correct; JIT operates with low inventory levels to minimize waste, while traditional approaches often maintain higher inventory levels to buffer against uncertainties.

Finally, based on this analysis, the major difference is that the JIT approach operates with low inventory levels while traditional approaches may operate with high inventory levels.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to determine the cost allocation for each component of the equipment. The total cost of the equipment is $100 million. The two major components that comprise 80% of the total cost would be:

Cost of two major components = 80% of $100 million = $80 million.

Each of these two components has a useful life of 20 years, so the annual depreciation for each of these components is:

Annual depreciation for each major component = $80 million / 20 years = $4 million.

Next, I will calculate the depreciation for the remaining two components, each costing $10 million. One has a useful life of 4 years and the other has a useful life of 5 years. The annual depreciation for each of these components is:

- For the 4-year component: $10 million / 4 years = $2.5 million.
- For the 5-year component: $10 million / 5 years = $2 million.

Now, I will sum up the annual depreciation expenses for all components:

Total depreciation expense = Depreciation for major components + Depreciation for 4-year component + Depreciation for 5-year component
= $4 million + $4 million + $2.5 million + $2 million
= $4 million + $2.5 million + $2 million
= $8.5 million.

Therefore, the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, year 1, is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the current situation. The current fixed asset process is being managed through a password-protected spreadsheet, which may work adequately for now but could pose risks in terms of scalability, security, and integration with other systems in the future.

Next, I should consider the long-term implications of each option. Continuing with the current spreadsheet process (option a) may not be sustainable as the company grows or if the complexity of asset management increases. Developing a new fixed asset system (option b) could be resource-intensive and may not be necessary if a suitable solution already exists. Purchasing a stand-alone program (option c) could lead to integration issues with other systems. 

Finally, adopting the fixed asset module of the new system for integration (option d) seems to be the most strategic choice. It would allow for better integration with other enterprise-wide processes, enhance data security, and provide a scalable solution that can grow with the company.

Therefore, the committee should recommend option d. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand what stratification means in the context of sampling. Stratification involves dividing a population into subgroups (strata) that share similar characteristics, which can help ensure that the sample is representative of the entire population.

Next, I will analyze each option to see which one aligns with the need for stratification:

a) If the auditor suspects management fraud, they may want to focus on specific areas but not necessarily stratify the entire population.

b) A desired assessed level of control risk being less than the prior year does not inherently require stratification; it may involve different testing approaches.

c) Attribute sampling is a technique that can be used for testing controls, but it does not specifically indicate the need for stratification.

d) If the auditor plans to give greater representation to large recorded amounts, this suggests a need to stratify the population to ensure that larger amounts are adequately represented in the sample.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate reason for stratifying the population is to give greater representation to large recorded amounts.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct statement regarding a shareholder's right to inspect corporate books and records, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option a: Is absolute.** - This statement is incorrect because a shareholder's right to inspect is not absolute; it can be limited by certain conditions and requirements.

2. **Option b: Is conditioned upon the demanding shareholder owning at least $5000 worth of stock.** - This statement is also incorrect. While some jurisdictions may have specific thresholds for ownership, the right to inspect is generally not conditioned on a specific dollar amount of stock ownership.

3. **Option c: Requires that the demand to inspect be for a proper purpose.** - This statement is correct. Shareholders typically must demonstrate a proper purpose for their request to inspect corporate records, such as investigating mismanagement or other legitimate concerns.

4. **Option d: Exists only when fraud or illegality is alleged.** - This statement is incorrect. The right to inspect does not solely exist in cases of fraud or illegality; it can be exercised for various legitimate purposes.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the typical procedures a CPA performs during a review of financial statements for a nonissuer. A review is less extensive than an audit and primarily involves inquiries and analytical procedures.

Next, I will analyze each option:
a) Making inquiries of management about cash balance restrictions is a common procedure in a review, as it helps assess liquidity and cash availability.
b) Communicating deficiencies in internal control is more typical of an audit rather than a review, where the CPA does not provide an opinion on internal controls.
c) Examining trend analysis is part of the analytical procedures in a review, but it is not specifically about assessing detection risk, which is more relevant to audits.
d) Evaluating management's plans for dealing with negative trends is also a part of the review process, as it helps understand the entity's future viability.

After considering these points, the most appropriate procedure that a CPA usually performs during a review is option a.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the cash disbursements for June purchases, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: The COGS for June is given as $300,000.

2. **Determine the change in merchandise inventory**: 
   - Beginning inventory (June 1) = $150,000
   - Ending inventory (June 30) = $180,000
   - The change in inventory = Ending inventory - Beginning inventory = $180,000 - $150,000 = $30,000 increase.

3. **Calculate the purchases for June**: 
   - Purchases can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Purchases} = \text{COGS} + \text{Ending Inventory} - \text{Beginning Inventory}
     \]
   - Substituting the values: 
     \[
     \text{Purchases} = 300,000 + 180,000 - 150,000 = 330,000
     \]

4. **Calculate cash disbursements for June purchases**: 
   - To find the cash disbursements, we need to consider the accounts payable at the beginning and end of June.
   - Beginning accounts payable (June 1) = $85,000
   - Ending accounts payable (June 30) = $75,000
   - The cash disbursements for purchases can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Cash Disbursements} = \text{Purchases} - \text{Decrease in Accounts Payable}
     \]
   - The decrease in accounts payable = Beginning accounts payable - Ending accounts payable = $85,000 - $75,000 = $10,000.
   - Therefore, cash disbursements = $330,000 - $10,000 = $320,000.

Thus, the amount Star should budget for cash disbursements for June purchases is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine West's AMT tax preference items, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the items that are considered AMT preferences. In this case, the long-term capital gain and dividends are not AMT preference items, but the percentage depletion in excess of the property's adjusted basis is.

2. The percentage depletion in excess of the property's adjusted basis is $9,000, which is an AMT preference item.

3. Since the long-term capital gain and dividends do not count as AMT preference items, the total amount of AMT tax preference items is simply the amount of the percentage depletion, which is $9,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the amount of loss accrual that should be reported in the December 31, year 1, IFRS statement of financial position, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the nature of the loss accrual**: The total loss accrual identified is $90,000, which includes $40,000 related to a year 1 event and $50,000 related to a year 2 event.

2. **Determine the reporting period**: Since we are preparing the statement for December 31, year 1, we need to consider only the loss accruals that pertain to events that occurred up to that date.

3. **Assess the loss accruals**: The $40,000 loss accrual is related to a year 1 event, which means it should be recognized in the year 1 financial statements. The $50,000 loss accrual pertains to a year 2 event and should not be included in the year 1 financial statements.

Based on this analysis, the company should report a loss accrual of $40,000 in its December 31, year 1, IFRS statement of financial position.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine whether a project should be accepted based on the present value of cash flows, I will follow these steps:

1. **Understanding Present Value**: The present value (PV) of cash flows represents the current worth of future cash flows generated by the project, discounted at a specific rate. 

2. **Investment Comparison**: A project is generally considered acceptable if the present value of its cash flows is greater than the initial investment. This means that the project is expected to generate more value than it costs.

3. **Decision Criteria**: If the present value of cash flows is equal to or greater than the initial investment, the project can be accepted. If it is less, the project should be rejected.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that a project should be accepted if the present value of cash flows from the project is greater than the initial investment.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine Gulde's basis in the land received from the Chyme Partnership, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distribution received**: Gulde received $12,000 in cash and land with a basis of $10,000. The total distribution is $12,000 (cash) + $10,000 (basis of land) = $22,000.

2. **Determine the amount of basis to allocate**: Gulde's tax basis in the partnership was $26,000. Since the total distribution of $22,000 is less than Gulde's basis, he will not recognize any gain. The basis in the land will be determined by the remaining basis after the cash distribution.

3. **Calculate the basis in the land**: Gulde's basis in the partnership is $26,000. After receiving $12,000 in cash, the remaining basis is $26,000 - $12,000 = $14,000. Since the basis of the land is $10,000, Gulde's basis in the land will be the lesser of the remaining basis ($14,000) or the adjusted basis of the land ($10,000). Therefore, Gulde's basis in the land will be $10,000.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the cash flows related to investing activities. The purchase of Otra Co. bonds for $200,000 is an investing activity, as it involves the acquisition of a long-term asset. 

Next, the purchase of U.S. Treasury bills for $50,000 is classified as a cash equivalent, which typically does not appear in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement. Instead, it is considered part of cash management.

Now, I will calculate the total cash used in investing activities. Since only the purchase of Otra Co. bonds is included, the total cash used in investing activities is $200,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the key information that a successor auditor would typically seek from a predecessor auditor after accepting an audit engagement. 

1. The successor auditor is interested in understanding any disagreements that may have occurred between the predecessor auditor and management regarding significant accounting policies and principles. This information is crucial for assessing potential risks in the audit.

2. The successor auditor would also want to know the predecessor auditor's perspective on the reasons for the change of auditors. This can provide insights into any underlying issues that may affect the audit.

3. Additionally, the successor auditor would be concerned with any facts known to the predecessor auditor that could impact the integrity of management. This is important for evaluating the reliability of the financial statements.

4. Lastly, understanding matters that may facilitate the evaluation of financial reporting consistency between the current and prior years is also relevant, as it helps in assessing the continuity and comparability of financial information.

Considering these points, the most comprehensive and relevant information that a successor auditor would ask for is likely to be related to the integrity of management and any significant disagreements.

After evaluating the options, the most appropriate choice is:
{'sol': 'c'}"
"To determine how the company's debt should be presented in its classified balance sheet, I will analyze each component of the debt:

1. **Line of Credit**: The company has drawn $250,000 from a $1,000,000 line of credit. Since this line of credit matures in one year, the entire drawn amount of $250,000 is classified as a current liability.

2. **Secured Note**: The $750,000 secured note is due in five annual installments. Since no repayments have been made in December, the current portion of this note would be the amount due within the next year. Assuming equal installments, the current portion would be $750,000 / 5 = $150,000. Therefore, $150,000 is classified as a current liability, and the remaining $600,000 is classified as a long-term liability.

3. **Balloon Note**: The $300,000 three-year balloon note is also classified as a long-term liability because it does not mature within the next year.

Now, I will sum up the current and long-term liabilities:

- **Current Liabilities**:
  - Line of Credit: $250,000
  - Current Portion of Secured Note: $150,000
  - Total Current Liabilities: $250,000 + $150,000 = $400,000

- **Long-Term Liabilities**:
  - Remaining Secured Note: $600,000
  - Balloon Note: $300,000
  - Total Long-Term Liabilities: $600,000 + $300,000 = $900,000

Finally, the total liabilities are:
- Current Liabilities: $400,000
- Long-Term Liabilities: $900,000

Thus, the correct presentation of the company's debt in the classified balance sheet on December 31, year 2 is:
{'sol': 'c'}"
"To determine the production budget for the first quarter, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the desired ending inventory for the first quarter**: The ending inventory for the first quarter should equal 30% of the second quarter's budgeted sales. The second quarter's budgeted sales are 40,000 units, so the desired ending inventory for the first quarter is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 40000 = 12000 \text{ units}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total units needed for the first quarter**: This is the sum of the budgeted sales for the first quarter and the desired ending inventory:
   \[
   \text{Budgeted sales for Q1} + \text{Desired ending inventory for Q1} = 30000 + 12000 = 42000 \text{ units}
   \]

3. **Calculate the production required for the first quarter**: This is the total units needed minus the beginning inventory:
   \[
   \text{Total units needed} - \text{Beginning inventory} = 42000 - 9000 = 33000 \text{ units}
   \]

Thus, the production budget should show that 33,000 units need to be produced during the first quarter. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to determine the amount of group term life insurance that Johnson received. Since Johnson's salary is $100,000, the amount of life insurance is twice that, which is $200,000.

Next, I will calculate the cost of the insurance that Johnson must include in gross income. The IRS established uniform cost of insurance is $2.76 per $1,000. Therefore, for $200,000 of insurance, the calculation is as follows:

Cost of insurance = ($200,000 / $1,000) * $2.76 = 200 * $2.76 = $552.

Now, I will add this cost to Johnson's salary to find the total amount that must be included in gross income:

Total gross income = Salary + Cost of insurance = $100,000 + $552 = $100,552.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the total amount of gross income from Ball that should be included in Vale's year 1 adjusted gross income, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify Vale's share of the partnership income**: Since Vale is a 50% partner in Ball Partnership, he will receive 50% of the reported income items. The income items reported are tax-exempt interest income of $80,000 and dividend income of $12,000. 

2. **Calculate Vale's share of the income**:
   - Tax-exempt interest income: 50% of $80,000 = $40,000
   - Dividend income: 50% of $12,000 = $6,000

3. **Sum the amounts**: The total gross income from Ball that Vale should include in his adjusted gross income is the sum of his share of the tax-exempt interest income and the dividend income:
   - Total gross income = $40,000 (tax-exempt interest) + $6,000 (dividend income) = $46,000

4. **Consider the cash distribution**: The $10,000 nonliquidating cash distribution does not affect the gross income calculation since it is a return of capital and not taxable income.

Thus, the total amount of gross income from Ball that should be included in Vale's year 1 adjusted gross income is $46,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze the situation regarding the sales increase in December and the subsequent decrease in January. A substantial increase in sales at the end of the year, followed by a drop in the following month, could indicate that the company is trying to inflate its revenue figures to present a stronger financial position at year-end.

Next, I should consider the implications of this pattern. Such behavior is often associated with financial reporting fraud, as companies may engage in practices like channel stuffing or recognizing revenue prematurely to meet financial targets or expectations.

Finally, based on the analysis, the most appropriate conclusion is that this pattern of sales could suggest a broader indication of financial reporting fraud rather than just misappropriation of assets or theft.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to determine the intrinsic value of the warrant. The intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the market price of the stock and the exercise price of the warrant. 

The market price of the share is $30, and the exercise price of the warrant is $20. Therefore, the intrinsic value of the warrant is:

Intrinsic Value = Market Price - Exercise Price = $30 - $20 = $10.

Next, since the warrant gives the right to buy the stock at a lower price than the current market price, the theoretical value of the warrant is equal to its intrinsic value, which is $10.

Finally, I will check the options provided to find the correct answer. The theoretical value of the warrant is $10.00.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the context of the question, which is about estimating a numerical measurement of a population, specifically the dollar value of inventory. 

Next, I will evaluate the options:
- a) Variable sampling is used to estimate the value of a population by measuring a variable (like dollar value) and is appropriate for this scenario.
- b) Discovery sampling is typically used to find a specific error or fraud in a population, not to estimate values.
- c) Attribute sampling is used to estimate the proportion of a population that has a certain attribute, which is not suitable for estimating dollar values.
- d) Random-number sampling is a method of selecting a sample but does not specifically relate to estimating numerical values.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate method for estimating a numerical measurement like the dollar value of inventory is variable sampling.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze the risks associated with using potentially incorrect end-user developed files. 

1. The first option states that management places the same degree of reliance on the files as they do on files generated from mainframe systems. This is a significant risk because if the end-user developed files are incorrect, it could lead to poor decision-making based on faulty data.

2. The second option mentions that management receives limited information for decision-making due to a lack of flexibility in EUC files. While this is a concern, it does not directly relate to the risk of using incorrect files.

3. The third option indicates that management is unable to respond to competitive pressures quickly. This could be a consequence of using incorrect files, but it is more about the impact rather than the risk itself.

4. The fourth option states that management continues to incur additional costs because it takes more hours to do tasks using EUC. This is more about inefficiency rather than the risk of incorrect data.

Based on this analysis, the most relevant risk associated with potentially incorrect end-user developed files is that management places the same degree of reliance on these files as they do on files generated from mainframe systems, which can lead to significant issues if the data is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which event most likely indicates the existence of related party transactions, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option a**: Insuring the lives of key executives and listing the entity as beneficiary. 
   - This could indicate a relationship between the company and its executives, but it does not necessarily imply a transaction that benefits one party over another in a way that is typical of related party transactions.

2. **Option b**: Selling real estate at a price that differs significantly from its appraised value.
   - This scenario suggests a transaction that may not be conducted at arm's length, which is a hallmark of related party transactions. If the sale price is significantly different from the appraised value, it could indicate that the transaction is influenced by a relationship between the buyer and seller.

3. **Option c**: Making a loan with specific scheduled terms for repayment of the funds.
   - While this could involve related parties, loans can also be made in a standard business context without indicating a related party transaction. The terms of the loan would need to be examined to determine if they are favorable or unusual.

4. **Option d**: Granting stock options to key executives at favorable prices.
   - This is a common practice in many companies, especially for incentivizing executives. However, it does suggest a relationship between the company and its executives, but it is a standard practice and may not necessarily indicate a related party transaction.

After analyzing all options, option b stands out as it directly suggests a transaction that is not at market value, which is a strong indicator of related party transactions.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand what significant debits to accumulated depreciation accounts imply. Accumulated depreciation is a contra asset account that reflects the total depreciation expense that has been charged against an asset over time. Significant debits could indicate adjustments or corrections to prior depreciation calculations.

Next, I will evaluate each option to see which one would most likely satisfy an auditor's inquiry regarding these significant debits:

a) If prior years’ depreciation expenses were erroneously understated, it would make sense to adjust the accumulated depreciation account to correct this error, leading to significant debits.

b) If the current year’s depreciation expense was erroneously understated, it would typically result in an increase in the current year’s expense rather than a significant debit to accumulated depreciation.

c) Revising the estimated remaining useful lives of plant assets upward would generally decrease future depreciation expenses, not create significant debits in the accumulated depreciation account.

d) If plant assets were retired during the current year, it would lead to a removal of accumulated depreciation related to those assets, but it wouldn't explain significant debits to the accumulated depreciation account.

Based on this analysis, the most likely explanation that would satisfy an auditor regarding significant debits to accumulated depreciation accounts is option a) prior years’ depreciation expenses were erroneously understated.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which item Sokro must add back to the change in net assets when preparing its statement of cash flows using the indirect method, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Understanding the indirect method**: The indirect method starts with the change in net assets and adjusts for non-cash transactions and changes in working capital accounts to arrive at net cash provided (used) by operating activities.

2. **Analyzing the options**:
   - **a) Purchase of equipment**: This is a cash outflow related to investing activities, not operating activities, so it would not be added back.
   - **b) Payment on long-term debt**: This is a financing activity and does not affect operating cash flows, so it would not be added back.
   - **c) Depreciation**: This is a non-cash expense that reduces net assets but does not involve cash outflow. Therefore, it is added back to the change in net assets in the operating activities section.
   - **d) Decrease in accounts payable**: A decrease in accounts payable indicates that cash has been used to pay off liabilities, which is a cash outflow and would not be added back.

3. **Conclusion**: The only item that Sokro must add back to the change in net assets is depreciation, as it is a non-cash expense.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the impact of the new time clock process on each of the options provided. 

a) Fraudulent reporting of employees’ own hours: The new system captures an image of the employee, which can deter employees from clocking in or out for others, thus reducing fraudulent reporting.

b) Errors in employees’ overtime computation: The system may help in accurately recording hours worked, but it does not directly address how overtime is calculated based on those hours.

c) Inaccurate accounting of employees’ hours: The new system is designed to accurately record when employees clock in and out, which should reduce inaccuracies in accounting for hours worked.

d) Recording of other employees’ hours: Since the system requires employees to select their own identification number and captures their image, it is specifically designed to prevent the recording of hours for other employees, making this the area least likely to change.

Based on this analysis, the exposure that the new system can be expected to change the least is the recording of other employees’ hours, as the system is designed to prevent this.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine in which situation a tax return preparer penalty would not be applicable, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Substantial Authority**: If there is substantial authority for the position taken on the tax return, it means that the position is well-supported by tax law and regulations. In this case, a penalty would not apply.

2. **More Likely Than Not**: If it is reasonable to believe that the position would more likely than not be upheld, this indicates a strong likelihood of success. This situation would also typically protect the preparer from penalties.

3. **Reasonable Possibility of Success**: A reasonable possibility of success suggests that there is some chance the position could be upheld, but it does not meet the higher threshold of ""more likely than not."" Therefore, this situation may not provide sufficient protection against penalties.

4. **Reasonable Basis**: A reasonable basis indicates that there is some support for the position, but it is weaker than the previous options. This may not be enough to avoid penalties, especially if the position is aggressive.

Based on this analysis, the situation where a tax return preparer penalty would not be applicable is when there is substantial authority for the position.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to determine the total cash inflow from the issuance of the common stock. Ace Co. issued 1000 shares at $15 per share, so the total cash inflow is 1000 shares * $15/share = $15,000.

Next, I need to classify this cash inflow. The issuance of common stock is considered a financing activity, as it involves raising capital for the company.

Finally, I will check the options provided. The correct classification of the cash inflow from the issuance of stock is a cash inflow from financing activities, which is $15,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to calculate the total dividends paid to the preferred shareholders. Since there are 10,000 shares of preferred stock and each share has a dividend of $5, the total preferred dividends are 10,000 * $5 = $50,000.

Next, I will subtract the preferred dividends from the net income to find the income available to common shareholders. The net income is $480,000, so the income available to common shareholders is $480,000 - $50,000 = $430,000.

Now, I need to calculate the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year. The company had 120,000 shares outstanding for the first quarter (3 months) and then issued an additional 40,000 shares on April 1, making a total of 160,000 shares outstanding for the remaining 9 months. The weighted average number of shares is calculated as follows:

- For the first 3 months: 120,000 shares * (3/12) = 30,000 shares
- For the remaining 9 months: 160,000 shares * (9/12) = 120,000 shares

Adding these together gives a total weighted average of 30,000 + 120,000 = 150,000 shares.

Finally, to find the earnings per share (EPS), I divide the income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares:

EPS = $430,000 / 150,000 shares = $2.87.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To calculate the depreciation expense using the double-declining balance method, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the straight-line depreciation rate**: The straight-line rate is calculated as 1 divided by the useful life of the asset. In this case, the useful life is 3 years, so the straight-line rate is 1/3 = 33.33%. The double-declining rate is double this, which is 66.67%.

2. **Calculate the depreciation expense for the first year**: The depreciation expense for the first year is calculated by multiplying the double-declining rate by the cost of the asset. So, for the first year, it would be 66.67% of $12,000, which equals $8,000.

3. **Determine the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31**: Since the computer was purchased on May 1, it was in use for 8 months of the year. Therefore, the depreciation expense for the year would be $8,000 multiplied by (8/12) = $5,333.33. However, since we are looking for the closest option, we can round it to $5,333.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the implications of the accountant's findings regarding the leases. Since the accountant has identified that several leases should be capitalized but are not, this represents a departure from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

Next, since the accountant considers these leases to be material to the financial statements, it is important to determine the appropriate response. An adverse opinion is warranted when the financial statements are materially misstated due to a significant departure from GAAP, which is the case here.

Finally, the options provided need to be evaluated. Issuing an adverse opinion (option a) is appropriate because the failure to capitalize the leases is a significant issue that affects the overall fairness of the financial statements. The other options do not adequately address the materiality of the issue.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To calculate Cobb Inc.'s weighted average cost of goods sold (COGS) for May, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of inventory available for sale**: 
   - Starting inventory: 200 units at a total cost of $1250.
   - Purchases:
     - May 4: 20 units at $5.80 each = $116.00
     - May 17: 80 units at $5.50 each = $440.00
   - Total cost of purchases = $116.00 + $440.00 = $556.00
   - Total cost of inventory available for sale = $1250 + $556 = $1806.00

2. **Calculate the total number of units available for sale**:
   - Starting inventory: 200 units
   - Purchases: 20 units + 80 units = 100 units
   - Total units available for sale = 200 + 100 = 300 units

3. **Calculate the weighted average cost per unit**:
   - Weighted average cost per unit = Total cost of inventory available for sale / Total units available for sale
   - Weighted average cost per unit = $1806.00 / 300 units = $6.02 per unit

4. **Calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS)**:
   - Cobb sold 10 units on May 14.
   - COGS = Number of units sold * Weighted average cost per unit
   - COGS = 10 units * $6.02 = $60.20

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the amount that Dash Co. should report as a liability in its June 30 balance sheet, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the utility bills that are unpaid as of June 30**: The utility bill for the period from May 16 to June 15, which amounts to $6,000, was paid on July 1. Therefore, this amount is a liability as of June 30.

2. **Check for any additional liabilities**: The utility bill for the period from June 16 to July 15, which amounts to $8,000, has not yet been paid by June 30. However, since this bill covers a period that extends beyond June 30, it will not be included in the liabilities reported on the June 30 balance sheet.

3. **Calculate the total liability**: The only liability that Dash Co. needs to report as of June 30 is the unpaid bill for the period May 16 to June 15, which is $6,000.

Thus, the amount that Dash should report as a liability in its June 30 balance sheet is $6,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to consider the circumstances of the surviving spouse. Since the spouse died on December 31 of year 1, the surviving spouse can still file as married for the year of death (year 1) if they choose to. 

Next, for year 2, the IRS allows a surviving spouse to file as a ""Qualifying widow(er)"" for two years following the death of their spouse, provided they have not remarried and meet certain conditions. In this case, since there are no dependents, the surviving spouse can still qualify for this status.

Finally, since the surviving spouse does not have any dependents and is not remarried, the correct filing status for year 2 would be ""Qualifying widow(er).""

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the cost per equivalent whole unit for the month of April, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Costs**: 
   - Direct Materials Cost: $114,000
   - Direct Labor Cost: $38,000
   - Manufacturing Overhead: 50% of Direct Materials = 0.5 * $114,000 = $57,000
   - Total Costs = Direct Materials + Direct Labor + Manufacturing Overhead = $114,000 + $38,000 + $57,000 = $209,000

2. **Calculate Equivalent Units**:
   - Completed Units: 9,000 units (100% complete)
   - Ending Work-in-Process Inventory: 1,000 units (10,000 started - 9,000 completed)
     - These units are complete as to materials (1,000 units) and 50% complete as to conversion (0.5 * 1,000 = 500 equivalent units).
   - Total Equivalent Units = Completed Units + Equivalent Units in Ending WIP = 9,000 + 1,000 + 500 = 10,500 equivalent units.

3. **Calculate Cost per Equivalent Whole Unit**:
   - Cost per Equivalent Unit = Total Costs / Total Equivalent Units = $209,000 / 10,500 = $19.90.

Since $19.90 is not one of the options, I will double-check the calculations. 

Upon reviewing, I realize that I need to consider the equivalent units for conversion costs separately. 

- Total Equivalent Units for Conversion Costs = Completed Units + Equivalent Units in Ending WIP = 9,000 + 500 = 9,500.
- Total Conversion Costs = Direct Labor + Manufacturing Overhead = $38,000 + $57,000 = $95,000.
- Cost per Equivalent Unit for Conversion = $95,000 / 9,500 = $10.

Now, I will calculate the total cost per equivalent unit by combining both materials and conversion costs.

- Total Equivalent Units for Materials = 10,000 (since all materials are complete).
- Cost per Equivalent Unit for Materials = $114,000 / 10,000 = $11.40.
- Total Cost per Equivalent Unit = Cost per Equivalent Unit for Materials + Cost per Equivalent Unit for Conversion = $11.40 + $10 = $21.40.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the due date for a federal estate tax return (Form 706) for a taxpayer who died on May 15, year 2, I will follow these steps:

1. The general rule is that the federal estate tax return is due nine months after the date of death. Since the taxpayer died on May 15, year 2, I will add nine months to this date.

2. Adding nine months to May 15, year 2, brings us to February 15, year 3.

3. Since the question specifies that a request for an extension of time is not filed, the due date remains February 15, year 3.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand what a stock split means. In a 5 for 1 stock split, each existing share is divided into 5 new shares. This means that the number of shares will increase, but the total value of the shares remains the same.

Next, I will calculate the new number of shares after the split. Alto Co. had 10,000 shares before the split. After a 5 for 1 split, the new number of shares will be 10,000 * 5 = 50,000 shares.

Now, I need to determine the new par value per share. The total par value of the stock before the split was 10,000 shares * $10 par value = $100,000. After the split, this total par value remains the same, but it is now divided among the new total of 50,000 shares. Therefore, the new par value per share will be $100,000 / 50,000 shares = $2.

Thus, the par value of the stock after the split is reduced to $2. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify the primary objective of substantive tests regarding stock options. The auditor's goal is to ensure that the stock options granted to senior management are valid, authorized, and properly reported.

Next, I will evaluate each option:
a) Confirming with management about their status as option holders may provide some assurance, but it does not verify the authorization or existence of the options.
b) Verifying the existence of option holders in payroll and human resources records is important, but it does not directly address the authorization of the options.
c) Tracing the authorization for the options granted to the board of directors' approval is crucial because it ensures that the options were properly authorized by the appropriate governing body.
d) Reviewing public records of the SEC for proper reporting is also important, but it comes after ensuring that the options were authorized and granted correctly.

Based on this analysis, the most direct and relevant substantive test regarding the granting of stock options is option c, as it focuses on the authorization process.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct tracing direction for detecting the overstatement of sales, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Understanding Overstatement of Sales**: The overstatement of sales occurs when sales are recorded that did not actually happen. To detect this, the auditor needs to verify that recorded sales transactions are supported by actual shipping documents.

2. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - **Option a**: Tracing from the Sales journal to the shipping documents would help verify if the sales recorded actually correspond to shipped goods. This is a valid approach to detect overstatement.
   - **Option b**: Tracing from shipping documents to the cash receipts journal would verify if cash was received for shipped goods, but it does not directly address whether the sales were overstated.
   - **Option c**: Tracing from the cash receipts journal to the customer's purchase orders does not help in verifying the sales recorded in the sales journal.
   - **Option d**: Tracing from the customer's purchase orders to the sales journal would help verify if the sales were based on actual orders, but it does not directly confirm that the sales recorded were shipped.

3. **Conclusion**: The most effective method to detect overstatement of sales is to trace transactions from the Sales journal to the shipping documents, as this confirms that recorded sales correspond to actual shipments.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the treatment of research and development (R&D) costs that have no alternative future use. Generally, according to accounting standards, R&D costs are typically expensed as incurred if they do not provide future economic benefits.

Next, I will evaluate the options provided:
- Option a) suggests charging all costs to expense when incurred, which aligns with the standard treatment for R&D costs with no alternative future use.
- Option b) suggests capitalizing all costs when incurred, which is not appropriate for R&D costs with no future benefits.
- Option c) suggests capitalizing costs specified by management and charging others to expense, which is not a standard approach for R&D costs.
- Option d) suggests accumulating costs in a separate component of stockholders' equity, which is also not a standard practice for R&D costs.

Based on this analysis, the correct method for accounting for R&D costs with no alternative future use is to charge all costs to expense when incurred.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which option is not considered a Level 2 observable input for fair value measurement, I will analyze each choice step by step.

1. **Choice a**: Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active. This refers to prices that may not be frequently traded but are still based on observable market data. This is typically considered a Level 2 input.

2. **Choice b**: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in markets that are active. This is a classic example of a Level 2 input, as it relies on observable market data for similar items.

3. **Choice c**: Internally generated cash flow projections for a related asset or liability. This is based on internal estimates and not on observable market data, which makes it a Level 3 input rather than Level 2.

4. **Choice d**: Interest rates that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. This is also considered a Level 2 input, as it is based on observable market data.

Based on this analysis, the option that does not fit as a Level 2 observable input is **Choice c**.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which pricing policy results in a price to external customers that is higher than the competitive price for a given industry, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Collusive pricing**: This occurs when firms in an industry agree to set prices at a certain level, often above the competitive price, to maximize their joint profits. This can lead to higher prices for external customers compared to competitive pricing.

2. **Dual pricing**: This refers to a situation where a company charges different prices for the same product in different markets or to different customers. This does not necessarily mean that the price is higher than the competitive price in all cases.

3. **Predatory pricing**: This strategy involves setting prices extremely low with the intent to eliminate competition. Once competitors are driven out, the company may raise prices. However, during the predatory phase, prices are typically below competitive levels.

4. **Transfer pricing**: This is the pricing of goods, services, and intangibles between related entities within a company. It does not directly affect external pricing but is more about internal accounting and tax implications.

Based on this analysis, the pricing policy that results in a price to external customers higher than the competitive price is **collusive pricing**.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the definitions of the terms provided in the choices. 

a) Prime costs refer to the direct costs of manufacturing a product, including direct materials and direct labor. 

b) Sunk costs are costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered, regardless of future actions. 

c) Opportunity costs represent the potential benefits that are missed when one alternative is chosen over another. 

d) Incremental costs are the additional costs that are incurred when making a decision or taking a specific action.

Next, I can see that the term that specifically refers to costs that cannot be changed or recovered is ""sunk costs."" 

Finally, since sunk costs are the only option that fits the description of unavoidable past costs that cannot be changed, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify what constitutes required supplementary information (RSI) for general purpose external financial reporting of a local government. Required supplementary information typically includes additional details that provide context to the financial statements.

Next, I will evaluate each option:
a) Fund financial statement - This is part of the basic financial statements, not RSI.
b) Combining nonmajor fund statement - This is also part of the basic financial statements and not considered RSI.
c) Notes to the financial statements - These are essential for understanding the financial statements but are not classified as RSI.
d) Management discussion and analysis - This is considered required supplementary information as it provides an overview of the financial activities and context for the financial statements.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer regarding simple linear regression between stock and market returns, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Understanding Simple Linear Regression**: In the context of finance, simple linear regression is often used to model the relationship between stock returns and market returns. The regression equation typically takes the form: Stock Return = α + β * Market Return + ε, where α is the intercept (alpha), β is the slope (beta), and ε is the error term.

2. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - **Option a**: ""fits the errors to obtain a more precise estimate of the stock’s beta."" This is misleading because the regression does not fit errors to estimate beta; rather, it estimates beta directly from the relationship between stock and market returns.
   - **Option b**: ""minimises the stock’s alpha, i.e. its idiosyncratic component."" This is incorrect because the regression does not aim to minimize alpha; it estimates alpha as part of the regression output.
   - **Option c**: ""estimates the alpha of stock returns and their dependence on the market returns."" This is accurate because the regression indeed estimates both alpha and beta, showing how stock returns depend on market returns.
   - **Option d**: ""models market returns as a function of the stock returns and its beta."" This is incorrect because the regression typically models stock returns as a function of market returns, not the other way around.

3. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the correct answer is that simple linear regression estimates the alpha of stock returns and their dependence on the market returns.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand what a derivative financial instrument is. A derivative is a financial contract whose value depends on the price of an underlying asset, index, or rate. Common examples include options, futures, and swaps.

Next, I will evaluate each option:
- a) Option contract: This is a classic example of a derivative, as its value is derived from the price of an underlying asset (like stocks).
- b) Municipal bond: This is a debt security issued by a local government or municipality, not a derivative.
- c) Bank certificate of deposit: This is a savings product offered by banks, which is also not a derivative.
- d) Money market fund: This is a type of mutual fund that invests in short-term, low-risk securities, and is not a derivative.

Based on this analysis, the only option that qualifies as a derivative financial instrument is the option contract.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the purpose of the accountant's report on projected financial statements. The report should clarify the nature of the projections and the limitations associated with them.

Next, I consider the options provided. Option (a) discusses disclaiming assurance on historical financial statements, which is not directly relevant to projected statements. Option (b) suggests expressing limited assurance about the results, but projections inherently involve uncertainty and do not guarantee outcomes.

Then, I analyze option (c), which describes the limitations on the usefulness of the projection. This is crucial because projections are based on assumptions and can vary significantly from actual results. Lastly, option (d) evaluates hypothetical assumptions, which is important but does not directly address the limitations of the projections themselves.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate choice is option (c), as it directly addresses the need to inform users about the limitations of the projections.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the incremental cash outflow at time period 0, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the initial investment**: This includes the cost of the machine and the shipping and installation costs. The total initial investment is:
   \[
   \text{Initial Investment} = \text{Cost of Machine} + \text{Shipping and Installation} = 475,000 + 5,000 = 480,000
   \]

2. **Consider the tax implications**: Since the machine will be depreciated, I need to account for the tax shield from depreciation. The machine falls under the 3-year MACRS property class, which has the following depreciation rates: 33.33%, 44.45%, 14.81%, and 7.22%. However, for the cash outflow at time 0, we only need the initial investment and not the tax shield.

3. **Final cash outflow**: The incremental cash outflow at time period 0 is simply the initial investment calculated in step 1, which is $480,000.

Thus, the closest answer for the incremental cash outflow at time period 0 is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the implications of an accountant having a direct financial interest in a nonissuer. Generally, independence is a key requirement for accountants when performing engagements, especially when it comes to issuing reports.

Next, since the interest is described as immaterial, I need to consider how immateriality affects independence. In many cases, an immaterial financial interest may not impair independence, but it still requires careful consideration of the specific engagement type.

Finally, for a compilation engagement, the accountant may still be able to issue a compilation report even if they are not independent, as long as they disclose their lack of independence. However, they would not be able to perform a review engagement due to the stricter independence requirements.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to determine Aston's share of the partnership's ordinary income. Since Aston and Becker are equal partners, they will each receive half of the partnership's ordinary income. The total ordinary income of the partnership is $20,000, so Aston's share is:

Ordinary income share = Total ordinary income / 2 = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000.

Next, I will confirm that this calculation is correct by considering the partnership's structure and the distribution. The distribution of $5,000 does not affect the calculation of ordinary income; it only affects Aston's basis in the partnership.

Finally, since the question specifically asks for Aston's share of the ordinary income, the answer is simply the calculated share of $10,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the nature of a review engagement for financial statements of a nonissuer. A review engagement is less extensive than an audit and primarily involves inquiries and analytical procedures rather than detailed testing of transactions.

Next, I will analyze each option:
a) Making inquiries of management about actions taken at board of directors' meetings is a common procedure in a review engagement, as it helps the accountant understand governance and decision-making processes.
b) Studying the relationships of financial statement elements expected to conform to predictable patterns is also typical in a review, as it involves analytical procedures to identify any unusual trends or discrepancies.
c) Identifying internal control activities that are likely to prevent or detect material misstatements is more characteristic of an audit engagement, where the auditor assesses the effectiveness of internal controls in detail.
d) Comparing the financial statements with anticipated results in budgets and forecasts is a standard analytical procedure performed during a review.

Based on this analysis, the procedure that an accountant would least likely perform during a review engagement is identifying internal control activities, as this is more aligned with an audit.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand what a compilation of financial statements entails. A compilation is a service provided by an accountant to assist management in presenting financial information in the form of financial statements without providing any assurance on them.

Next, I will analyze the choices provided:
a) This option suggests that the compilation presents accounting data that conforms with a special purpose framework other than GAAP, which is not the primary focus of a compilation.
b) This option states that the compilation includes unaudited financial statements that omit substantially all required GAAP disclosures, which is not accurate as compilations do not typically omit disclosures.
c) This option indicates that the compilation presents information that is the representation of management, which aligns with the nature of a compilation where the accountant does not verify the information.
d) This option refers to supplementary financial information that has been subjected to inquiry and analytical procedures, which is more aligned with a review rather than a compilation.

Based on this analysis, the most accurate choice that describes a compilation of financial statements is option c, as it reflects the nature of the service being a representation of management without assurance.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To find the required rate of return for Stocks A and B using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the market risk premium**: The market risk premium is the expected return on the market minus the risk-free rate. 
   \[
   \text{Market Risk Premium} = \text{Expected Return on Market} - \text{Risk-Free Rate} = 10\% - 7\% = 3\%
   \]

2. **Calculate the required rate of return for Stock A**: Using the CAPM formula:
   \[
   \text{Required Return} = \text{Risk-Free Rate} + \beta \times \text{Market Risk Premium}
   \]
   For Stock A (β = 0.8):
   \[
   \text{Required Return for A} = 7\% + 0.8 \times 3\% = 7\% + 2.4\% = 9.4\%
   \]

3. **Calculate the required rate of return for Stock B**: Using the same CAPM formula for Stock B (β = 1.4):
   \[
   \text{Required Return for B} = 7\% + 1.4 \times 3\% = 7\% + 4.2\% = 11.2\%
   \]

Now, I have the required rates of return for both stocks:
- Stock A: 9.4%
- Stock B: 11.2%

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to calculate the total current assets using the current ratio. The current ratio is given as 3-to-1, which means for every $3 of current assets, there is $1 of current liabilities. Given that current liabilities are $322,000, the total current assets can be calculated as:

Total Current Assets = Current Liabilities * Current Ratio
Total Current Assets = $322,000 * 3 = $966,000.

Next, I will calculate the total amount of quick assets using the quick ratio. The quick ratio is given as 1-to-1, meaning that quick assets are equal to current liabilities. Therefore, the total quick assets are:

Total Quick Assets = Current Liabilities * Quick Ratio
Total Quick Assets = $322,000 * 1 = $322,000.

Quick assets are defined as current assets minus inventory and prepaid expenses. Therefore, I can find the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses by subtracting the total quick assets from the total current assets:

Inventory and Prepaid Expenses = Total Current Assets - Total Quick Assets
Inventory and Prepaid Expenses = $966,000 - $322,000 = $644,000.

Thus, the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses is $644,000. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze the characteristics of information in statistical tables versus financial statements.

First, I need to understand that financial statements typically provide a snapshot of a company's financial position at a specific point in time, including the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. They focus on current financial data.

Next, statistical tables in a comprehensive annual financial report often include additional information such as financial trends over multiple fiscal years. This data helps stakeholders understand how the company's financial performance has changed over time.

Now, I will evaluate the choices:
- ""Data covering financial trends"" is indeed a characteristic of statistical tables.
- ""Fiscal years"" refers to the time period over which financial data is reported, which is also relevant to statistical tables.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that statistical tables include both characteristics (data covering financial trends and fiscal years), while financial statements do not typically include trend data.

Thus, the answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to identify the purpose of the documents mentioned in the choices. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issues various documents as part of its due-process activities to solicit feedback on proposed changes to accounting standards.

Next, I will analyze the options:
a) A proposed statement of position is typically used for guidance on specific accounting issues but is not specifically for amending the Codification.
b) A proposed accounting standards update is specifically designed to propose changes to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and is part of the due-process activities.
c) A proposed accounting research bulletin is not commonly used in the context of amending the Codification.
d) A proposed staff accounting bulletin provides guidance but is not the primary document for amending the Codification.

Based on this analysis, the document that is typically issued for amending the FASB Accounting Standards Codification is the proposed accounting standards update.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the functional currency of a foreign subsidiary, I will follow these steps:

1. **Understanding Functional Currency**: The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. This is typically the currency in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash.

2. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - Option a) suggests it is the currency in which the subsidiary maintains its accounting records. While this can be a factor, it is not the sole determinant.
   - Option b) states it is the currency of the country in which the subsidiary is located. This is not always true, as the economic environment may dictate a different currency.
   - Option c) indicates it is the currency of the country in which the parent is located. This is also not necessarily correct, as the subsidiary may operate in a different economic environment.
   - Option d) correctly identifies that the functional currency is the currency of the environment in which the subsidiary primarily generates and expends cash.

3. **Conclusion**: Based on the definition and evaluation of the options, the correct answer is that the functional currency is determined by the environment in which the subsidiary primarily generates and expends cash.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify the purpose of each component within the COSO Internal Control—Integrated Framework. 

1. The control environment sets the tone at the top and establishes the foundation for internal controls, but it does not specifically ensure ongoing effectiveness.
2. Risk assessment involves identifying and analyzing risks that could affect the achievement of objectives, but it is not focused on the ongoing operation of controls.
3. Information and communication ensure that relevant information is communicated effectively, but again, this does not directly relate to the continuous operation of controls.
4. Monitoring is specifically designed to assess the quality of internal control performance over time and ensure that controls are operating effectively.

Based on this analysis, the component that ensures internal controls continue to operate effectively is Monitoring.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the intrinsic value of the call option at the time of initial investment, I need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the exercise price and the market price**: The exercise price of the call option is $9 per share, and the market price at the time of investment is $10 per share.

2. **Calculate the intrinsic value per share**: The intrinsic value of a call option is calculated as the maximum of (market price - exercise price) or 0. In this case, it would be:
   \[
   \text{Intrinsic Value per Share} = \text{Market Price} - \text{Exercise Price} = 10 - 9 = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total intrinsic value for 100 shares**: Since the option is for 100 shares, the total intrinsic value is:
   \[
   \text{Total Intrinsic Value} = \text{Intrinsic Value per Share} \times \text{Number of Shares} = 1 \times 100 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the intrinsic value of the call option at the time of initial investment is $100. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which option does not impose penalties on tax return preparers according to the Internal Revenue Code and Regulations, I will analyze each choice step by step.

1. **Option a**: Failure to sign a prepared tax return as a tax preparer. 
   - Tax preparers are required to sign the returns they prepare. Failure to do so can lead to penalties.

2. **Option b**: Failure to provide a copy of a prepared tax return to the taxpayer.
   - Tax preparers must provide a copy of the return to the taxpayer. Not doing so can also result in penalties.

3. **Option c**: Failure to notify a taxpayer about an inadvertent error on a tax return filed 10 years ago.
   - There is no requirement for tax preparers to notify taxpayers about errors from a long time ago, especially if it is beyond the statute of limitations for corrections. Therefore, this option does not impose penalties.

4. **Option d**: Failure to retain copies of prepared tax returns or a list of taxpayers for whom such returns were prepared for the last three years.
   - Tax preparers are required to retain copies of tax returns or a list of taxpayers for a specified period. Not retaining these can lead to penalties.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is option c, as it does not impose penalties on tax return preparers.

Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the purpose of an emphasis-of-matter paragraph in an audit report. This paragraph is used to highlight a matter that is relevant to the users' understanding of the financial statements, but it does not change the auditor's opinion.

Next, I need to determine the correct placement of the emphasis-of-matter paragraph in the audit report. According to auditing standards, the emphasis-of-matter paragraph should be included after the opinion paragraph.

Finally, I will evaluate the options provided to find the correct answer based on the placement and requirements for the emphasis-of-matter paragraph.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the liability of a CPA (Certified Public Accountant) in the context of issuing an unqualified opinion on materially misstated financial statements. 

1. A CPA can be held liable to third parties if they can prove that the CPA acted with fraud or gross negligence. In this case, the CPA fraudulently issued an unqualified opinion, which indicates a serious breach of duty.

2. Corporate shareholders are typically considered primary users of financial statements and can claim damages if they relied on the CPA's opinion when making investment decisions. Therefore, the CPA would be liable to corporate shareholders.

3. Corporate bondholders, as investors who rely on the financial statements to assess the creditworthiness of the corporation, can also claim damages if they relied on the CPA's fraudulent opinion. Thus, the CPA would also be liable to corporate bondholders.

Based on this analysis, the CPA would be liable to both corporate shareholders and corporate bondholders. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct statement regarding an individual’s suspended passive activity losses, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option a**: ""$3,000 of suspended losses can be utilized each year against portfolio income."" - This statement is incorrect. Suspended passive activity losses can only offset passive income, not portfolio income.

2. **Option b**: ""Suspended losses can be carried forward, but not back, until utilized."" - This statement is correct. Suspended passive activity losses can be carried forward indefinitely until they are utilized against passive income.

3. **Option c**: ""Suspended losses must be carried back three years and forward seven years."" - This statement is incorrect. Suspended losses cannot be carried back; they can only be carried forward.

4. **Option d**: ""A maximum of 50% of the suspended losses can be used each year when an election is made to forgo the carryback period."" - This statement is also incorrect. There is no limitation of 50% on the use of suspended losses; they can be fully utilized against passive income when it is available.

Based on this analysis, the correct statement is option b. Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the amount of costs that should be expensed as research and development (R&D) costs, I will analyze each expenditure step by step.

1. **Labor and material costs incurred in producing a prototype**: These costs are typically considered R&D expenses because they are related to the development of a new product. Therefore, this amount of $100,000 should be included.

2. **Cost of testing the prototype**: This cost is also related to the development phase of the product and is considered an R&D expense. Thus, the $40,000 for testing should be included as well.

3. **Legal costs to file a patent**: These costs are not considered R&D expenses. Instead, they are capitalized as part of the patent costs and are not expensed in the R&D phase.

Now, I will sum the relevant R&D costs:
- Labor and material costs: $100,000
- Cost of testing: $40,000

Total R&D costs = $100,000 + $40,000 = $140,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the implications of finding unexpected errors during the interim audit procedures. This indicates a higher risk of material misstatement in accounts receivable, which requires a more thorough audit response.

Next, I will evaluate the options provided:

a) Moving detailed analytical procedures from year-end to interim could help identify issues earlier, but it may not address the increased risk directly.

b) Increasing the dollar threshold of vouching customer invoices could lead to missing significant errors, which is not a suitable response to increased risk.

c) Sending negative accounts receivable confirmations instead of positive confirmations is generally less effective in high-risk situations, as negative confirmations rely on the absence of response, which may not provide sufficient assurance.

d) Using more experienced audit team members to perform year-end testing would likely enhance the quality of the audit work and provide a better response to the increased risk.

Considering these evaluations, the most appropriate audit response to address the change in risk assessment due to unexpected errors is to use more experienced audit team members to perform year-end testing.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the implications of an auditor having substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. This situation typically raises concerns about the entity's financial health and its ability to meet obligations.

Next, I should consider the options provided. The auditor's primary concern in this scenario would likely relate to how the entity's financial difficulties could impact its financial statements, particularly in terms of asset valuations, liabilities, and disclosures regarding going concern.

Finally, I will evaluate the options:
a) Control environment factors are important but not directly related to the immediate financial concerns.
b) Correlation of detection risk and inherent risk is more about audit risk rather than the entity's financial viability.
c) Effectiveness of internal control activities is relevant but does not directly address the financial statement implications.
d) Possible effects on the entity’s financial statements directly relate to how the going concern issue could affect reported figures.

Given this analysis, the most relevant concern for the auditor would be the possible effects on the entity’s financial statements.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze the options step by step.

First, I need to understand what the statement of activities in government-wide financial statements typically includes. It generally presents the overall financial activities of the government, distinguishing between different types of activities.

1. **Option a** mentions separate columns for governmental activities, business-type activities, and discretely presented component units. This aligns with the structure of government-wide financial statements, which typically categorize activities in this manner.

2. **Option b** suggests separate columns for each major governmental fund. However, the government-wide financial statements do not present information at the fund level; they focus on the overall activities instead.

3. **Option c** proposes separate columns for each nonmajor governmental fund. Similar to option b, this is not applicable to government-wide financial statements, which do not break down activities by individual funds.

4. **Option d** states that there is a separate section at the bottom of the statement that shows program and general revenues. While this is true, it does not encompass the overall structure of the statement of activities as comprehensively as option a.

Based on this analysis, the most accurate choice that reflects the structure of the statement of activities in government-wide financial statements is option a.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the context of a practitioner's report on the application of agreed-upon procedures. This type of report typically includes specific statements that clarify the nature of the engagement and the results of the procedures performed.

Next, I will evaluate each option:
a) A statement that the practitioner performed an examination of prospective financial statements is incorrect because agreed-upon procedures are not the same as an examination.
b) A statement of scope limitation that will qualify the practitioner’s opinion is not applicable here, as agreed-upon procedures do not provide an opinion.
c) A statement referring to standards established by the AICPA is relevant, as it indicates the framework under which the procedures were performed.
d) A statement of negative assurance based on procedures performed is also relevant, as it reflects the nature of the findings from the agreed-upon procedures.

Finally, the most appropriate statement to include in a practitioner's report on the application of agreed-upon procedures is option c, as it establishes the context and standards for the procedures performed.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To find the conversion price, I will follow these steps:

1. The conversion price can be calculated using the formula: Conversion Price = Par Value / Conversion Ratio.
2. In this case, the par value of the debenture is $500 and the conversion ratio is 20.
3. Therefore, the conversion price is calculated as follows: Conversion Price = $500 / 20 = $25.00.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify what an audit trail in an electronic data interchange (EDI) system entails. An audit trail is a record that provides documentary evidence of the sequence of activities that have affected a specific operation, procedure, or event.

Next, I will evaluate each option to see which one aligns with the concept of an audit trail. 

a) An integrated test facility that verifies the accuracy of data is more about testing and validation rather than tracking transactions.

b) A heuristic program that accesses remote locations does not relate to tracking or documenting transactions.

c) Hardware security modules that store sensitive data focus on data protection rather than providing a record of transactions.

d) Computer activity logs that indicate failed transactions provide a record of what has occurred in the system, which is essential for an audit trail.

Based on this analysis, the essential element of the audit trail in an EDI system is option d. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To calculate the times-interest-earned (TIE) ratio, I need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)**: 
   The formula for EBIT is:
   \[
   \text{EBIT} = \text{Income after tax} + \text{Interest expense} + \text{Tax expense}
   \]
   First, I need to find the tax expense. Since the income after tax is $5.4 million and the tax rate is 40%, I can calculate the pre-tax income:
   \[
   \text{Pre-tax income} = \frac{\text{Income after tax}}{1 - \text{Tax rate}} = \frac{5.4}{1 - 0.4} = \frac{5.4}{0.6} = 9 \text{ million}
   \]
   Now, I can find the tax expense:
   \[
   \text{Tax expense} = \text{Pre-tax income} \times \text{Tax rate} = 9 \times 0.4 = 3.6 \text{ million}
   \]
   Now, substituting back into the EBIT formula:
   \[
   \text{EBIT} = 5.4 + 1 + 3.6 = 10 \text{ million}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Times-Interest-Earned Ratio**:
   The TIE ratio is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{TIE} = \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest expense}} = \frac{10}{1} = 10
   \]

3. **Select the correct answer**:
   The calculated TIE ratio is 10, which corresponds to option d.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of responsibility accounting. Responsibility accounting focuses on evaluating the performance of managers based on the revenues and costs that they can control. 

Next, I will analyze the choices provided:
a) This option emphasizes the development of performance reports that highlight costs and revenues under the control of managers, which aligns with the core principle of responsibility accounting.
b) This option discusses the allocation of service department costs, which is more about cost allocation rather than the essence of responsibility accounting.
c) This option focuses on blame for variances, which is not the primary goal of responsibility accounting; it is more about performance evaluation.
d) This option suggests investigating all variances, which is not specific to responsibility accounting as it does not focus on the controllable aspects.

Based on this analysis, the best choice that captures the essence of responsibility accounting is option a. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the impact of switching from FIFO to LIFO during a period of inflation on Mast Co.'s ending inventory and income tax payable, I will analyze the effects step by step.

1. **Ending Inventory**: Under FIFO (First-In, First-Out), the oldest inventory costs are used up first, which means that the ending inventory consists of the most recently purchased (and typically more expensive) inventory during inflation. Conversely, under LIFO (Last-In, First-Out), the most recent costs are used first, leaving the older, cheaper inventory in the ending inventory. Therefore, during inflation, the ending inventory under LIFO will be lower than under FIFO.

2. **Income Tax Payable**: The choice of inventory method affects the cost of goods sold (COGS). Under LIFO, COGS will be higher because the more expensive recent inventory is accounted for first. Higher COGS results in lower taxable income, which means that the income tax payable will be lower under LIFO compared to FIFO.

3. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, during a period of inflation, Mast Co.'s ending inventory using LIFO will be lower than FIFO, and the income tax payable using LIFO will also be lower than FIFO.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand what goodwill is in accounting terms. Goodwill is an intangible asset that arises when a company acquires another business for more than the fair value of its net identifiable assets. 

Next, I will evaluate the options provided:
a) Costs incurred in the development of goodwill do not necessarily mean that goodwill should be recognized, as it must be linked to an acquisition.
b) Goodwill is recognized when it is created in the purchase of a business, as this is when the company pays more than the fair value of the identifiable net assets.
c) While expecting a future benefit from goodwill is important, it does not trigger recognition; the actual acquisition does.
d) The fair market value of the company’s assets exceeding the book value does not directly relate to the recognition of goodwill unless it is in the context of an acquisition.

Based on this analysis, the correct point at which a company should recognize goodwill is when it has been created in the purchase of a business.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the time limits for filing a claim for a refund of federal income taxes. Generally, the IRS allows taxpayers to file a claim for a refund within a specific period after the taxes were paid.

Next, the standard time limit for filing a claim for a refund is typically three years from the date the tax return was due or two years from the date the tax was paid, whichever is longer.

Since the individual paid taxes 27 months ago, I need to determine if this falls within the three-year period. Since 27 months is equivalent to 2 years and 3 months, the individual is still within the three-year limit.

Finally, since the individual is looking to file a claim for a refund, the correct answer is that they must file the claim within three years after the taxes were paid.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the key components of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures. Quality control in auditing typically includes aspects such as client acceptance, independence, and professional conduct.

Next, I will evaluate each option:
a) Acceptance of a client relationship - This is a critical part of quality control as it ensures that the firm only accepts clients that meet certain ethical and professional standards.
b) Professional skepticism of management - While important in the auditing process, it is more of an attitude or approach rather than a policy or procedure.
c) Computer information processing - This relates to the tools and technology used in auditing but does not directly pertain to quality control policies.
d) Efficiency of organizational structures - This is more about the internal management of the firm rather than a specific quality control policy.

Based on this analysis, the most relevant option that directly pertains to quality control policies and procedures in a CPA firm's auditing practice is a) Acceptance of a client relationship.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct statement regarding the IRS agent's proposed adjustment, I will analyze the options step by step.

1. **Understanding the Statute of Limitations**: The IRS generally has a three-year statute of limitations for assessing additional tax on a return. However, if there is substantial understatement of income or fraud, this period can be extended. In this case, the agent does not find the error to be fraudulent or substantial.

2. **Evaluating Each Option**:
   - **Option a**: This states that the adjustment is improper because an agent may only propose adjustments to the year under examination. This is incorrect because the IRS can propose adjustments to prior years if they are related to the current examination and within the statute of limitations.
   - **Option b**: This claims that there is no statute of limitations for improperly claiming personal expenses as business expenses. This is misleading; while certain claims can be challenged, the general statute of limitations still applies.
   - **Option c**: This suggests that the adjustment is proper because it relates to a change in accounting method, which can be made retroactively. However, the adjustment in question does not pertain to a change in accounting method.
   - **Option d**: This states that the adjustment is improper because the statute of limitations has expired for several years of the adjustment. Given that the agent does not find the error to be substantial or fraudulent, and since the adjustment spans multiple years, this option is likely correct.

3. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most accurate statement is that the adjustment is improper due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for several years involved in the adjustment.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To find the carrying amount of the machine at the end of its second year using the double-declining balance method, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the depreciation rate**: The straight-line depreciation rate is calculated as 1 divided by the useful life. For an 8-year life, the straight-line rate is 1/8 = 12.5%. The double-declining balance rate is double this, so 12.5% * 2 = 25%.

2. **Calculate the depreciation for the first year**: The first year's depreciation is calculated on the initial cost of the machine. Therefore, the depreciation for the first year is 25% of $140,000, which is $35,000. The carrying amount at the end of the first year is $140,000 - $35,000 = $105,000.

3. **Calculate the depreciation for the second year**: For the second year, the depreciation is calculated on the carrying amount at the end of the first year. So, the depreciation for the second year is 25% of $105,000, which is $26,250. The carrying amount at the end of the second year is $105,000 - $26,250 = $78,750.

Thus, the carrying amount of the machine in Hall's balance sheet at the end of its second year of operations is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to determine the annual expense related to the new roads based on their useful life. The total cost of the new roads is $800,000, and they have a useful life of 20 years. 

Next, I will calculate the annual expense by dividing the total cost by the useful life: 
$800,000 ÷ 20 years = $40,000 per year.

Finally, since the question asks for the amount that Large City should report as an expense related to the new roads in the statement of activities for the current year, the answer is $40,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to determine the useful life of the copyright for amortization purposes. Since Corbet expects to sell the book for five years, the useful life for amortization will be 5 years.

Next, I will calculate the annual amortization expense. The total cost of the copyright is $20,000, and if we divide this by the useful life of 5 years, the annual amortization expense will be:

Annual Amortization Expense = Total Cost / Useful Life = $20,000 / 5 = $4,000.

Since this is the end of the current year, Corbet should report an amortization expense of $4,000 related to the copyright.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the gain that the shareholder must recognize, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount realized**: The amount realized by the shareholder is the fair market value of the equipment contributed minus the liability assumed by the corporation. In this case, the fair market value is $20,000 and the liability is $12,000. Therefore, the amount realized is $20,000 - $12,000 = $8,000.

2. **Calculate the basis of the equipment**: The basis of the equipment contributed is $6,000. This is the original basis of the equipment before any liabilities are considered.

3. **Determine the gain recognized**: The gain recognized is the amount realized minus the basis of the equipment. Thus, the gain recognized is $8,000 (amount realized) - $6,000 (basis) = $2,000.

However, since the liability assumed by the corporation is greater than the basis of the equipment, the gain recognized is limited to the amount of the liability. Therefore, the recognized gain is $12,000 (the liability).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To calculate Carter's working capital at the end of the current year, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Current Assets**: 
   - Cash and cash equivalents: $200,000
   - Short-term investments: $100,000
   - Accounts receivable: $400,000
   - Inventories: $600,000
   - Total Current Assets = $200,000 + $100,000 + $400,000 + $600,000 = $1,400,000

2. **Identify Current Liabilities**: 
   - Current Liabilities = $640,000

3. **Calculate Working Capital**: 
   - Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Current Liabilities
   - Working Capital = $1,400,000 - $640,000 = $760,000

Now, I will check the options provided:
- a) $60,000
- b) $560,000
- c) $660,000
- d) $960,000

None of the options match the calculated working capital of $760,000. However, I will assume that the question might have a typo or error in the options provided. 

Since the calculated working capital is $760,000, I will conclude that the answer is not listed among the options. 

Therefore, the answer is not available in the provided choices. 

However, if I must select the closest option, I would choose {'sol': 'd'} as it is the highest value, but it does not accurately reflect the calculated working capital."
"First, I need to understand the context of the question, which involves the liability of a CPA (Certified Public Accountant) when they fail to adhere to the standards of due care during an audit. 

Next, I will analyze the options provided:
- a) Strict liability: This typically applies in cases where a party is held liable regardless of fault or negligence, often in tort cases involving inherently dangerous activities.
- b) Breach of contract: This involves failing to fulfill the terms of a contract, which is not directly applicable to the scenario of an audit.
- c) Negligence: This refers to a failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in similar circumstances, which could apply to the CPA's actions.
- d) Gross negligence: This is a more severe form of negligence that indicates a significant departure from the standard of care, which seems relevant given the term ""recklessly departs.""

Finally, since the question specifies ""recklessly departs from the standards of due care,"" this suggests a higher level of negligence, which aligns with gross negligence. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To calculate the net present value (NPV), I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the present value of cash inflows**: The cash inflows are $3,000 at the end of each year for five years. The formula for the present value of an annuity is:
   \[
   PV = C \times \left(1 - (1 + r)^{-n}\right) / r
   \]
   where \(C\) is the cash inflow per period ($3,000), \(r\) is the discount rate (10% or 0.10), and \(n\) is the number of periods (5 years).

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   PV = 3000 \times \left(1 - (1 + 0.10)^{-5}\right) / 0.10
   \]
   \[
   PV = 3000 \times \left(1 - (1.10)^{-5}\right) / 0.10
   \]
   \[
   PV = 3000 \times \left(1 - 0.620921\right) / 0.10
   \]
   \[
   PV = 3000 \times 0.379079 / 0.10
   \]
   \[
   PV = 3000 \times 3.79079 = 11372.37
   \]

2. **Calculate the NPV**: The NPV is calculated by subtracting the initial investment from the present value of cash inflows:
   \[
   NPV = PV - Initial\ Investment
   \]
   \[
   NPV = 11372.37 - 11000 = 372.37
   \]

3. **Round the NPV**: The NPV is approximately $370 when rounded to the nearest dollar.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which factor would heighten an auditor's concern about the risk of fraudulent financial reporting, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option a**: The audit committee's approval of the initial selection of accounting principles. 
   - While the audit committee's involvement is important, their approval alone does not necessarily indicate a heightened risk of fraud. It is a standard procedure in financial reporting.

2. **Option b**: A lack of competition in the entity's industry accompanied by increasing profit margins.
   - This situation could raise concerns, as it may suggest that management has less pressure to perform ethically. However, it does not directly indicate fraudulent activity.

3. **Option c**: Management's disclosure of unresolved litigation and contingent liabilities.
   - Disclosure of such items is a normal part of financial reporting and does not inherently heighten the risk of fraud. It shows transparency rather than a risk factor.

4. **Option d**: Year-end adjustments by the entity that significantly affect financial results.
   - This is a critical factor. Significant year-end adjustments can be a red flag for potential manipulation of financial results, as they may be used to meet earnings targets or hide poor performance.

After analyzing all options, the factor that most likely heightens an auditor's concern about the risk of fraudulent financial reporting is option d.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which technique effectively measures improvements in product quality as a result of internal failure costs, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Inspection of in-process goods**: This technique focuses on identifying defects during the production process. While it can help prevent defects from reaching the final product, it does not directly measure improvements in product quality over time.

2. **Recording the number of products returned over time**: This method tracks customer returns, which can indicate quality issues. However, it primarily reflects external failure costs rather than internal failure costs, and it does not directly measure improvements in product quality.

3. **Tracking the number of products reworked**: This technique measures how many products need to be reworked due to defects identified during production. A decrease in the number of reworked products over time would indicate an improvement in product quality and a reduction in internal failure costs.

4. **Tracking warranty expenses over time**: This method monitors the costs associated with warranty claims. While it can provide insights into product quality, it is more related to external failure costs rather than internal failure costs.

Based on this analysis, the most effective technique for measuring improvements in product quality as a result of internal failure costs is tracking the number of products reworked.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the implications of the CPA's actions regarding the lack of inquiry into the documentation for business travel expenses. The CPA has a responsibility to ensure that the information provided is accurate and substantiated.

Next, if the CPA fails to inquire about documentation, it could lead to the preparation of a tax return that is not compliant with IRS regulations. This could potentially result in penalties for the CPA as a tax return preparer if the expenses are later disallowed.

Then, regarding the client's situation, if the return is audited and the expenses are disallowed, the client may still face an understatement penalty, especially if the expenses were not substantiated. However, the client may not be subject to a fraud penalty if there was no intent to deceive.

Considering these points, the most accurate statement regarding the consequence of the CPA's lack of inquiry is that the CPA may be assessed a tax return preparer penalty.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the accounting treatment for equipment used in research and development (R&D) activities. Generally, if the equipment has alternative future uses, it should not be expensed immediately.

Next, I consider the options provided. Option (a) suggests expensing the cost in the year the project starts, which is not appropriate for equipment with alternative future uses. Option (b) suggests capitalizing and depreciating over the term of the project, but this is not correct since the equipment can be used beyond the project.

Then, I evaluate option (c), which states that the equipment should be capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful life. This aligns with accounting principles, as the equipment will provide benefits over multiple periods.

Finally, option (d) suggests that the treatment could vary depending on the project term, but this is misleading since the equipment's alternative future uses dictate that it should be capitalized.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the total liabilities to be reported in the consolidated financial statements, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total liabilities of both companies**: 
   - King, Inc. has liabilities of $450,000.
   - Simmon Co. has liabilities of $200,000.
   - Total liabilities before any adjustments = $450,000 + $200,000 = $650,000.

2. **Adjust for intercompany transactions**: 
   - Since Simmon Co. has a note payable of $100,000 to King, Inc., this amount is an intercompany liability. In consolidated financial statements, intercompany transactions are eliminated to avoid double counting.
   - Therefore, I need to subtract the $100,000 note payable from the total liabilities calculated in step 1.

3. **Calculate the adjusted total liabilities**: 
   - Adjusted total liabilities = $650,000 - $100,000 = $550,000.

Thus, the amount of total liabilities that should be reported in the consolidated financial statements is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the most likely reason for accounts receivable being categorized as ""exceptions"" by an auditor, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option a**: Customers who have credit or zero balances with the client. 
   - If customers have credit or zero balances, they may not be relevant to the accounts receivable confirmation process, but this does not directly explain why they would be categorized as exceptions.

2. **Option b**: Responses that were mailed rather than faxed to the auditor.
   - While the method of response could affect the confirmation process, it does not inherently categorize accounts as exceptions. The auditor would still consider the responses valid unless there were issues with the responses themselves.

3. **Option c**: Accounts receivable that have been classified as uncollectible.
   - Accounts classified as uncollectible would likely be exceptions because they indicate that the amounts are not expected to be collected, which is a significant concern for auditors.

4. **Option d**: Payments mailed to the client that have not been recorded.
   - This situation could lead to discrepancies in the accounts receivable balance, but it does not directly categorize accounts as exceptions unless it is specifically noted in the confirmation process.

After analyzing all options, the most logical choice for why accounts receivable would be categorized as ""exceptions"" is due to accounts that have been classified as uncollectible, as this directly relates to the auditor's concerns about the validity of the receivables.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct description of accruals and deferrals in accrual accounting, I will analyze the definitions of both terms.

1. **Accruals**: These are adjustments for revenues that have been earned but not yet received in cash, or expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid in cash. This means accruals are related to expected future cash receipts and payments based on current transactions.

2. **Deferrals**: These refer to cash that has been received or paid but the related revenue or expense has not yet been recognized. This means deferrals are concerned with past cash receipts and payments that will affect future periods.

3. Based on these definitions, I can conclude that accruals deal with future expectations while deferrals relate to past transactions.

Thus, the best description is: 
a) Accruals are concerned with expected future cash receipts and payments while deferrals are concerned with past cash receipts and payments.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to assess the situation regarding the misapplications of accounting principles and unreasonable estimates in the financial statements. Since management is unwilling to revise the financial statements, the accountant faces a dilemma in how to proceed.

Next, I consider the options available. Option (a) suggests disclaiming an opinion and advising the board that the financial statements should not be relied upon. This is a strong action that indicates serious concerns about the financial statements. Option (b) involves restricting the distribution of the report, which may not fully address the issues at hand. Option (c) suggests adding a separate paragraph to describe the deficiencies, but since management is unwilling to revise the statements, this may not be sufficient. Finally, option (d) involves withdrawing from the engagement, which may be necessary if the accountant feels that the integrity of the financial reporting is compromised.

After evaluating these options, the most appropriate course of action is to withdraw from the compilation engagement and provide no further services concerning these financial statements, as the accountant cannot ensure the reliability of the financial statements under the current circumstances.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which of the options cannot be amortized for tax purposes, I will analyze each choice step by step.

1. **Incorporation costs**: These are generally considered startup costs and can be amortized over a period of time for tax purposes.

2. **Temporary directors’ fees**: These fees are typically considered ordinary business expenses and can be deducted in the year they are incurred, rather than being amortized.

3. **Stock issuance costs**: These costs are usually not amortized but rather deducted as a reduction of the equity raised when the stock is issued.

4. **Organizational meeting costs**: Similar to incorporation costs, these can also be amortized over a period of time for tax purposes.

Based on this analysis, the option that cannot be amortized for tax purposes is **temporary directors’ fees**. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the definitions of the options provided. 

1. **Measuring the performance gap** refers to identifying the difference between current performance and desired performance, but it does not specifically involve comparison to the best possible levels.
  
2. **Standard measurement** involves using established standards to assess performance, but it may not necessarily compare to the best practices or levels.

3. **Benchmarking** is the process of comparing a business's performance metrics to industry bests or best practices from other companies. This directly involves measuring and evaluating products and services relative to the best possible levels of performance.

4. **Variance management** focuses on analyzing the differences between planned and actual performance, which is more about managing discrepancies rather than evaluating against the best levels.

Based on these definitions, the process that best fits the description of measuring and evaluating products and services relative to the best possible levels of performance is benchmarking.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to determine the contribution margin in dollar terms. The contribution margin is calculated as the selling price minus the variable costs. Since management wants a 20% contribution margin on a selling price of $19.00, I can calculate the contribution margin as follows:

Contribution Margin = Selling Price × Contribution Margin Percentage
Contribution Margin = $19.00 × 20% = $3.80

Next, I need to find the total variable costs that will allow for this contribution margin. The total variable costs consist of the variable selling and distribution costs plus the variable manufacturing costs. Therefore, I can set up the equation:

Total Variable Costs = Selling Price - Contribution Margin
Total Variable Costs = $19.00 - $3.80 = $15.20

Now, I know that the total variable costs include the variable selling and distribution costs of $3.00 per unit. To find the target variable manufacturing cost, I can subtract the variable selling and distribution costs from the total variable costs:

Target Variable Manufacturing Cost = Total Variable Costs - Variable Selling and Distribution Costs
Target Variable Manufacturing Cost = $15.20 - $3.00 = $12.20

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to adjust the reported pretax income for the errors discovered during the audit. The reported pretax income is $152,500.

1. The ending inventory is overstated by $30,000. This means that the cost of goods sold (COGS) is understated by the same amount, which would increase the pretax income. Therefore, I need to subtract this overstatement from the reported income: 
   $152,500 - $30,000 = $122,500.

2. The depreciation expense is understated by $64,000. This means that the expenses are lower than they should be, which also increases the pretax income. Therefore, I need to subtract this understatement from the adjusted income: 
   $122,500 - $64,000 = $58,500.

Now, I have calculated the correct pretax income to be $58,500.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which defense is likely to be successful in a suit alleging negligence by a CPA, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Due care**: This defense suggests that the CPA acted with the appropriate level of care expected in their profession. If a CPA can demonstrate that they followed all relevant standards and practices, this defense could be successful.

2. **Ignorance of the law**: Generally, ignorance of the law is not a valid defense in negligence cases. Professionals are expected to be knowledgeable about the laws and regulations governing their practice, so this defense is unlikely to be successful.

3. **Lack of intent**: Negligence does not require intent; it is based on a failure to exercise reasonable care. Therefore, claiming a lack of intent would not be a strong defense in a negligence suit.

4. **Lack of mental capacity**: While this could be a defense in some cases, it is not typically applicable to professional negligence claims unless the CPA was unable to understand their actions due to a mental condition at the time of the alleged negligence.

After analyzing these options, the most likely successful defense in a suit alleging negligence by a CPA is due care, as it directly addresses the standard of care expected in their professional duties.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the amount of depreciation Baker can deduct in the current year, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the depreciation percentages for the first two years**: According to the MACRS schedule for five-year property, the depreciation percentages are:
   - First year: 20.00%
   - Second year: 32.00%
   - Third year: 19.20%

2. **Calculate the depreciation for the first two years**: 
   - For the first year: $10,000 * 20.00% = $2,000
   - For the second year: $10,000 * 32.00% = $3,200

3. **Determine the depreciation for the current year**: Since Baker sold the equipment on March 1 of the current year, he will only be able to deduct the depreciation for the first two months of the third year. The third-year depreciation is 19.20%, but since the equipment was held for only 2 months of that year, the calculation will be:
   - Third year depreciation for the full year: $10,000 * 19.20% = $1,920
   - Depreciation for 2 months: ($1,920 / 12) * 2 = $320

Now, I will summarize the deductions:
- Total depreciation for the first year: $2,000
- Total depreciation for the second year: $3,200
- Depreciation for the current year (2 months of the third year): $320

However, the question asks for the amount of depreciation that can be deducted in the current year, which is only the $320 calculated for the two months of the third year.

Since none of the options provided match this amount, I will check the options again. The closest option that reflects a reasonable deduction for the current year based on the MACRS schedule is $533, which could be a miscalculation or rounding in the options provided.

Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the implications of the entity maintaining its accounts on a comprehensive basis of accounting other than GAAP. This means that the financial statements do not conform to the standard accounting principles typically used.

Next, I consider the actions an accountant can take in this situation. The accountant cannot simply withdraw from the engagement without further consideration, as there are options available to address the situation.

Then, I evaluate the choices provided. The most appropriate action for the accountant would be to modify the review report to indicate that the financial statements are presented on a basis other than GAAP. This is a common practice to ensure transparency and inform users of the financial statements about the basis of accounting used.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine how the city of Cobb should report each trust fund, I will analyze the characteristics of both trust funds.

1. **Trust Fund A**: This fund allows only the earnings (interest) to be expended, while the principal remains intact. This characteristic indicates that it is a permanent fund, as the principal is not used for expenditures.

2. **Trust Fund B**: This fund allows both the principal and interest to be expended. Since the principal can be used, this fund does not meet the criteria for a permanent fund. Instead, it is classified as a special revenue fund because it can be used for specific purposes.

Based on this analysis, Trust Fund A should be reported as a Permanent fund, and Trust Fund B should be reported as a Special revenue fund.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to calculate the average inventory before the improvement in inventory turnover. The formula for inventory turnover (IT) is:

\[ IT = \frac{COGS}{\text{Average Inventory}} \]

Given that the IT is 5 times and COGS is $800,000, I can rearrange the formula to find the average inventory:

\[ \text{Average Inventory} = \frac{COGS}{IT} = \frac{800,000}{5} = 160,000 \]

Next, I will calculate the average inventory after the improvement in inventory turnover to 8 times:

\[ \text{Average Inventory} = \frac{COGS}{IT} = \frac{800,000}{8} = 100,000 \]

Now, I can determine the change in inventory by subtracting the new average inventory from the old average inventory:

\[ \text{Change in Inventory} = 160,000 - 100,000 = 60,000 \]

This indicates that $60,000 is released from inventory due to the improvement in inventory turnover.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the purpose of an auditor's engagement letter. An engagement letter outlines the responsibilities of both the auditor and the management of the company being audited.

Next, I will analyze each option to see which one aligns with the typical content of an engagement letter:

a) This statement suggests a responsibility of management but does not clearly define the auditor's role or responsibilities, which is typically included in an engagement letter.

b) This statement refers to the auditor's actions regarding internal controls, but it is more about the auditor's procedures rather than a responsibility outlined in the engagement letter.

c) This statement implies a commitment from management to correct deficiencies, which is not typically a part of the engagement letter. The letter usually outlines responsibilities rather than commitments.

d) This statement clearly defines a responsibility of management to provide access to financial records and information, which is a common inclusion in an engagement letter.

Based on this analysis, the statement that would most likely appear in an auditor's engagement letter is option d.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which factor would most likely cause a CPA not to accept a new audit engagement, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Management reputation for failing to provide schedules to prior auditors on a timely basis**: While this is a concern, it may not be a definitive reason for rejecting an engagement. The CPA might still consider accepting the engagement if they believe they can manage the situation.

2. **The CPA's inability to review the predecessor auditor's working papers**: This is a significant issue because reviewing the predecessor's working papers is crucial for understanding the prior audit and assessing risks. However, it may not be an outright reason to reject the engagement if other factors are favorable.

3. **Management's unwillingness to make all financial records available to the CPA**: This is a critical factor. If management is unwilling to provide necessary financial records, the CPA cannot perform a proper audit, which would likely lead to a refusal to accept the engagement.

4. **The CPA's lack of understanding of the entity's operations and industry**: While this could be a concern, CPAs often have the ability to learn about new industries. This alone may not be a strong enough reason to reject an engagement.

After evaluating these factors, the most compelling reason for a CPA to not accept a new audit engagement is management's unwillingness to make all financial records available to the CPA, as this directly impacts the ability to conduct a proper audit.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which pairs of elements a client must prove to hold an accountant liable for common law fraud, I will analyze the options step by step.

1. **Understanding Common Law Fraud**: Common law fraud typically requires the plaintiff to prove several elements, including a false representation, knowledge of its falsity (scienter), intent to deceive, justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation, and damages resulting from that reliance.

2. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - **Option a**: Material misrepresentation and breach of contract. While material misrepresentation is relevant, breach of contract is not a necessary element for proving fraud.
   - **Option b**: Freedom from contributory negligence and loss. Contributory negligence is not a requirement for proving fraud, and while loss is relevant, it is not sufficient on its own.
   - **Option c**: Scienter and justifiable reliance. Scienter (knowledge of the falsity) and justifiable reliance (the victim relied on the misrepresentation) are both essential elements of common law fraud.
   - **Option d**: Intent to deceive and privity. Intent to deceive is relevant, but privity (a direct relationship) is not a necessary element for fraud claims.

3. **Conclusion**: The only option that includes two essential elements required to prove common law fraud is option c, which includes both scienter and justifiable reliance.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the implications of using the LIFO (Last In, First Out) method compared to FIFO (First In, First Out) in terms of cost of sales and taxable income. In periods of rising prices, LIFO results in higher cost of sales and lower taxable income compared to FIFO, which is the opposite of option a).

Next, I need to consider the requirement for using the LIFO method. The IRS does not require annual permission to continue using LIFO once it has been adopted, which makes option b) incorrect.

Then, I will evaluate the flexibility of using LIFO for tax purposes while using FIFO for financial statements. It is indeed permissible to use LIFO for tax purposes and FIFO for financial reporting, making option c) correct.

Finally, I will assess the treatment of inventory under LIFO. Under LIFO, the inventory on hand at the end of the year is actually composed of the oldest goods, not the earliest acquired goods, which makes option d) incorrect.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the initial investment basis**: Lemon purchased 2000 shares at $10.50 each. Therefore, the total basis for the original shares is:
   \[
   2000 \text{ shares} \times 10.50 \text{ dollars/share} = 21,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Account for the non-taxable dividend**: In year 4, Lemon received a 5% non-taxable dividend. This means Lemon received additional shares equal to 5% of 2000 shares:
   \[
   2000 \text{ shares} \times 0.05 = 100 \text{ additional shares}
   \]
   After this dividend, Lemon now has:
   \[
   2000 + 100 = 2100 \text{ shares}
   \]

3. **Account for the stock split**: In year 5, the stock split 2-for-1. This means Lemon's total shares doubled:
   \[
   2100 \text{ shares} \times 2 = 4200 \text{ shares}
   \]

4. **Calculate the basis per share**: The total basis remains the same at $21,000, but now it is spread over 4200 shares:
   \[
   \text{Basis per share} = \frac{21,000 \text{ dollars}}{4200 \text{ shares}} = 5 \text{ dollars/share}
   \]

5. **Calculate the basis for the 800 shares sold**: To find the basis for the 800 shares sold, I multiply the basis per share by the number of shares sold:
   \[
   800 \text{ shares} \times 5 \text{ dollars/share} = 4,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold is $4,000. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze the implications of increasing the credit period from 30 to 60 days. This change means that customers will have more time to pay their invoices, which could potentially lead to an increase in sales as customers may be more willing to make purchases if they have a longer time to pay.

Next, I should consider the impact on the average collection period. By extending the credit period, the average collection period will likely increase because it will take longer to collect payments from customers.

Finally, I need to evaluate the potential effects on bad debt losses and profits. While a longer credit period might encourage more sales, it could also lead to higher bad debt losses if customers take longer to pay or default on payments. The impact on profits is uncertain and would depend on the balance between increased sales and potential losses.

Given this analysis, the most direct and likely outcome of increasing the credit period is an increase in the average collection period.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which characteristic would heighten an auditor's concern about the risk of material misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option a**: The entity's industry is experiencing declining customer demand. 
   - This could indicate financial pressure on the entity, which might lead management to manipulate financial results to present a more favorable picture. However, it is more related to the overall economic environment rather than a direct indicator of fraud.

2. **Option b**: Employees who handle cash receipts are not bonded.
   - Not bonding employees who handle cash increases the risk of theft or fraud, as there is no insurance to cover losses. This is a significant internal control weakness that could lead to fraudulent financial reporting.

3. **Option c**: Bank reconciliations usually include in-transit deposits.
   - While in-transit deposits can complicate reconciliations, they are a common practice and do not inherently indicate a risk of fraud. This is more of a procedural issue than a direct risk factor for fraudulent reporting.

4. **Option d**: Equipment is often sold at a loss before being fully depreciated.
   - Selling equipment at a loss could indicate poor management decisions or financial distress, but it does not directly suggest fraudulent financial reporting. It may raise concerns about asset valuation but is not a clear indicator of fraud.

After analyzing these options, the characteristic that most likely heightens an auditor's concern about the risk of material misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting is option b, as it directly relates to a lack of internal controls over cash handling.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the context of the auditor's task. The auditor is selecting purchase orders to ensure they have been properly approved before any office equipment is ordered. If a random number matches a voided purchase order, the auditor needs to determine the reason for the voiding.

Next, I will analyze the choices provided:

a) If the voided purchase order represents office equipment ordered and never received, it indicates a potential issue with the ordering process, but it does not clarify whether the voiding was appropriate.

b) If the voided purchase order has been properly voided in the normal course of business, it suggests that the voiding was legitimate and the auditor can replace it with another order for inspection.

c) If the voided purchase order represents office equipment ordered and canceled before being processed by the vendor, it indicates that the order was not completed, but it does not clarify the legitimacy of the voiding.

d) If the voided purchase order has been electronically deleted from the purchase order file, it raises concerns about record-keeping and whether the voiding was properly documented.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate choice for the auditor to replace the voided purchase order is when it has been properly voided in the normal course of business, as this indicates that the voiding was legitimate and does not require further inspection.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the purpose of tests of details in an audit. Tests of details are designed to provide evidence regarding specific assertions made by management in the financial statements.

Next, I will analyze the options provided:
a) The planned level of control risk - This is related to the auditor's assessment of internal controls but does not directly relate to the sufficiency of audit evidence.
b) Management’s assertions that internal controls exist and are operating efficiently - While this is important, tests of details focus more on the financial statement assertions rather than just internal controls.
c) The effectiveness of internal controls - This is more about the overall assessment of internal controls rather than the specific evidence needed for financial statement assertions.
d) The planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level - This option directly relates to the auditor's need to gather sufficient evidence to support the assertions made in the financial statements.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is option d, as tests of details are specifically designed to ensure that sufficient audit evidence supports the planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the nature of an agreed-upon procedures engagement. In such engagements, the auditor performs specific procedures that are agreed upon by the parties involved, and the report typically includes the procedures performed and the findings.

Next, I need to consider the options provided. A disclaimer of opinion (option a) is not applicable here because the report will not express an opinion but rather report on the findings of the procedures performed. An opinion about the effectiveness of internal controls (option c) is also not relevant, as agreed-upon procedures do not provide an opinion on internal controls.

Then, I look at option d, which states that the sufficiency of the procedures is solely Mill's responsibility. This is not correct because the sufficiency of the procedures is determined by the parties involved, not solely by Mill.

Therefore, the most appropriate choice is option b, which states that the report should contain a list of the procedures performed and Mill's findings.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to determine the basis that the child will use for the stock. Since Simmons gave the stock as a gift and no gift tax was paid, the child takes the donor's basis, which is $40,000.

Next, I need to find out the selling price of the stock. The child sold the stock for $36,000.

Now, I can calculate the recognized gain or loss by subtracting the basis from the selling price: 

Recognized gain/loss = Selling price - Basis
Recognized gain/loss = $36,000 - $40,000 = -$4,000

Since this is a negative value, it indicates a loss. Therefore, the child has a recognized loss of $4,000.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which investment Goll Co. should account for using the equity method, I need to consider the level of influence Goll has over each company based on its ownership percentage.

1. The equity method is typically used when an investor has significant influence over an investee, which is generally indicated by ownership of 20% to 50% of the voting stock. Goll Co. has a 25% interest in Rose Co. and an 18% interest in Jave Co.

2. Goll Co.'s 25% interest in Rose Co. falls within the range that usually indicates significant influence. However, the problem states that Goll does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over either company's operating and financial policies.

3. Goll's 18% interest in Jave Co. is below the 20% threshold that typically suggests significant influence. Since the problem explicitly states that Goll cannot exercise significant influence over either company, it implies that neither investment qualifies for the equity method.

Based on this analysis, Goll Co. should not account for either investment using the equity method. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To find the present value (PV) of $10 received in two years at a discount rate of 9%, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the formula for present value**: The formula for present value is given by:
   \[
   PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n}
   \]
   where \(FV\) is the future value, \(r\) is the discount rate, and \(n\) is the number of years until the payment is received.

2. **Substitute the values into the formula**: Here, \(FV = 10\), \(r = 0.09\), and \(n = 2\). Plugging these values into the formula gives:
   \[
   PV = \frac{10}{(1 + 0.09)^2} = \frac{10}{(1.09)^2}
   \]

3. **Calculate the denominator**: First, calculate \(1.09^2\):
   \[
   1.09^2 = 1.1881
   \]
   Now, substitute this back into the present value formula:
   \[
   PV = \frac{10}{1.1881} \approx 8.42
   \]

Thus, the present value of $10 received in two years at a discount rate of 9% is approximately $8.42. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which circumstance generally causes a discharge of contractual duties by operation of law, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Novation**: This involves replacing one of the parties in a contract with the consent of all parties involved. While it does discharge the original party from the contract, it is not a discharge by operation of law but rather a mutual agreement.

2. **Accord and satisfaction**: This is an agreement to accept a different performance than what was originally agreed upon. It discharges the original obligation but is also based on mutual agreement rather than operation of law.

3. **Anticipatory repudiation**: This occurs when one party indicates they will not fulfill their contractual obligations before the performance is due. While it allows the other party to treat the contract as breached, it does not discharge the contract by operation of law.

4. **Impossibility of performance**: This occurs when an unforeseen event makes it impossible for one or both parties to fulfill their contractual obligations. This is a recognized legal doctrine that discharges contractual duties by operation of law, as the law recognizes that the contract cannot be performed.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which option an auditor would most likely examine when searching for unrecorded liabilities, I will analyze each choice step by step.

1. **Cutoff bank statement for deposits recorded in the books but not by the bank**: This option relates to cash transactions and focuses on deposits rather than liabilities. It does not directly help in identifying unrecorded liabilities.

2. **Details of accounts receivable confirmations that are classified as ""exceptions""**: This option pertains to accounts receivable, which is an asset, not a liability. Therefore, it is not relevant for identifying unrecorded liabilities.

3. **Files of purchase requisitions for items ordered just before the year end**: This option involves purchase orders, which may indicate future liabilities. However, it does not directly confirm whether liabilities have been recorded or not.

4. **Receiving reports for items received before year end but not yet recorded**: This option is directly related to liabilities. If items were received before year-end but not recorded, it indicates that there are liabilities that have not been recognized in the financial statements.

Based on this analysis, the most relevant choice for an auditor searching for unrecorded liabilities is option d.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To calculate Merritt Co.'s weighted-average cost of capital (WACC), I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the after-tax cost of debt**: The formula for the after-tax cost of debt is:
   \[
   \text{After-tax cost of debt} = \text{Pretax cost of debt} \times (1 - \text{Tax rate})
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{After-tax cost of debt} = 5\% \times (1 - 0.21) = 5\% \times 0.79 = 3.95\%
   \]

2. **Calculate the weighted costs**: The WACC is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{WACC} = (E/V) \times r_e + (D/V) \times r_d \times (1 - T)
   \]
   Where:
   - \(E/V\) is the proportion of equity (20% or 0.20)
   - \(D/V\) is the proportion of debt (80% or 0.80)
   - \(r_e\) is the cost of equity (10% or 0.10)
   - \(r_d\) is the pretax cost of debt (5% or 0.05)
   - \(T\) is the tax rate (21% or 0.21)

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{WACC} = (0.20 \times 0.10) + (0.80 \times 3.95\%)
   \]
   \[
   \text{WACC} = 0.02 + (0.80 \times 0.0395) = 0.02 + 0.0316 = 0.0516
   \]

3. **Convert to percentage**: Finally, I convert the WACC to a percentage:
   \[
   \text{WACC} = 0.0516 \times 100 = 5.16\%
   \]

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine Greene's basis in Seagull at the end of the year, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the initial basis**: Greene's initial basis at the beginning of the year is $15,000.

2. **Adjust for ordinary loss**: Since Seagull reported an ordinary loss of $5,000, this loss will reduce Greene's basis. Therefore, the new basis after accounting for the loss is:
   \[
   15,000 - 5,000 = 10,000
   \]

3. **Adjust for cash distribution**: Seagull distributed cash of $6,000 to Greene. This distribution will further reduce Greene's basis. Thus, the final basis after the distribution is:
   \[
   10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000
   \]

4. **Municipal bond interest**: The $2,000 of municipal bond interest does not affect Greene's basis because it is not taxable income for S corporations.

Now, Greene's basis in Seagull at the end of the year is $4,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the impact of the unreported depreciation on the financial statements. The unreported depreciation of $40,000 would have reduced taxable income, and since the tax rate is 20%, the tax effect of this depreciation would be $40,000 * 20% = $8,000. 

Next, I need to determine how this affects the accumulated depreciation. The total depreciation that should be recognized in the current year is the unreported amount of $40,000, but I also need to consider the tax effect. The net effect on the financial statements would be the unreported depreciation minus the tax effect, which is $40,000 - $8,000 = $32,000.

Finally, since the question asks how Holt should report the correction of the error, it should be reported as an increase in accumulated depreciation by the net amount of $32,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate each option to determine which factor would most likely lead an accountant to decline an engagement to compile financial statements.

a) A lack of segregation of duties in the entity's accounting and payroll departments could indicate a risk of errors or fraud, but it does not necessarily prevent an accountant from accepting the engagement.

b) Indications that reports of asset misappropriation are not investigated by management suggest a serious issue with internal controls and governance, which could lead to a refusal to accept the engagement due to ethical concerns.

c) The entity's intention to omit substantially all disclosures required by GAAP is a significant issue because it would result in financial statements that do not present a fair view of the entity's financial position, which is a fundamental requirement for an accountant.

d) Management's acknowledgment that the financial statements will be included in a written personal financial plan does not inherently pose a problem for the accountant, as long as the financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable standards.

After analyzing these options, the most compelling reason for an accountant to decline the engagement is option c, as omitting substantial disclosures would violate GAAP and compromise the integrity of the financial statements.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which transaction illustrates the doctrine of substantial performance, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option a**: Blair ordered a dozen blue chairs but received a dozen red chairs. This does not illustrate substantial performance because the delivery does not meet the essential terms of the contract (the color of the chairs).

2. **Option b**: Leslie painted an entire room but failed to put the electrical outlet covers back on. This could illustrate substantial performance because the main task (painting the room) was completed, and the omission of the outlet covers is a minor detail that does not affect the overall purpose of the contract.

3. **Option c**: A contract required hair styling to be done to Toby's satisfaction, but Toby was in good faith dissatisfied with the completed result. This does not illustrate substantial performance because the satisfaction clause is subjective, and if Toby is dissatisfied, it indicates that the performance did not meet the contract's requirements.

4. **Option d**: A dentist competently completed the extraction of Lee's tooth but mistakenly pulled the wrong one. This does not illustrate substantial performance because the dentist failed to perform the essential task correctly, which is to extract the correct tooth.

Based on this analysis, option b is the only one that correctly illustrates the doctrine of substantial performance, as the main obligation was fulfilled despite a minor omission.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: ""Deviations from pertinent controls do not affect the risk of material misstatement in the accounting records."" This statement is incorrect because deviations from controls can indeed affect the risk of material misstatement.

2. **Option b**: ""Deviations from pertinent controls at a given rate ordinarily result in misstatements at a lower rate."" This statement is misleading. While some deviations may not lead to misstatements, it is not accurate to say that they result in misstatements at a lower rate.

3. **Option c**: ""When the degree of assurance desired in a sample is high the auditor should allow for a high level of sampling risk."" This statement is incorrect. A higher degree of assurance typically requires a lower level of sampling risk, not a higher one.

4. **Option d**: ""Increasing the number of items selected for the test of controls usually increases the tolerable rate of deviations."" This statement is also misleading. Increasing the sample size generally decreases the sampling risk and allows for a more precise estimate of the rate of deviations, but it does not necessarily increase the tolerable rate of deviations.

After analyzing all options, none of them accurately reflect the principles of auditing and statistical sampling. However, the most reasonable choice in the context of tolerable rates of deviations is option b, as it suggests a relationship between deviations and misstatements, albeit not perfectly stated.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To calculate the beta of Stock A, I will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the formula for beta**: Beta (β) is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \beta = \frac{\text{Covariance (Stock A, Market Index)}}{\text{Variance (Market Index)}}
   \]
   The variance of the market index can be calculated as the square of its standard deviation.

2. **Calculate the variance of the market index**: The standard deviation of the market index is given as 14%. Therefore, the variance is:
   \[
   \text{Variance} = (0.14)^2 = 0.0196
   \]

3. **Calculate beta**: Now, using the covariance of 88 and the variance calculated:
   \[
   \beta = \frac{88}{0.0196} \approx 4489.80
   \]
   However, I need to ensure that I am using the correct units. Since the covariance is given in percentage terms, I should convert it to a decimal by dividing by 100:
   \[
   \beta = \frac{0.88}{0.0196} \approx 44.89
   \]
   This value seems too high, indicating a possible miscalculation in the interpretation of the covariance. 

4. **Re-evaluate the calculation**: The covariance should be treated as a percentage, so:
   \[
   \beta = \frac{0.88}{0.0196} \approx 44.89
   \]
   This is still not matching the options provided. 

5. **Final calculation**: I will recalculate using the correct interpretation of the covariance:
   \[
   \beta = \frac{88}{(0.14)^2} = \frac{88}{0.0196} \approx 4489.80
   \]
   This indicates a misunderstanding of the covariance value. 

After careful consideration, I realize that the covariance should be treated as a direct value without conversion. Thus, I will use the original covariance value directly.

Finally, I will check the options again and find the closest match.

After reviewing the calculations and options, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss that Summer can deduct for the current year, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the previous net operating loss (NOL)**: Summer had a net operating loss of $20,000 three years ago, with three-fourths of that loss ($15,000) attributed to Code Sec. 1244 stock. This means that $15,000 of the previous NOL can be treated as an ordinary loss.

2. **Calculate the current year’s losses**: In the current year, Summer has a gross income of $80,000 and sustains another loss of $50,000 on Code Sec. 1244 stock. Since this is a loss on Code Sec. 1244 stock, it is treated as an ordinary loss.

3. **Combine the losses**: Summer can carry forward the entire $20,000 NOL to the current year. The total ordinary loss for the current year would be the $15,000 from the previous NOL plus the $50,000 from the current year’s loss on Code Sec. 1244 stock, resulting in a total ordinary loss of $65,000. However, since the NOL can only offset the current year’s income, we need to consider the gross income of $80,000.

4. **Determine the deductible amount**: The total ordinary loss of $65,000 exceeds the gross income of $80,000, but the entire amount of the current year’s Code Sec. 1244 loss ($50,000) can be deducted as an ordinary loss, as it is not limited by the NOL carryforward.

Thus, the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss that Summer can deduct for the current year is $50,000 ordinary loss.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the appropriate accounting treatment for the lawsuit, I will follow these steps:

1. **Assess the likelihood of the outcome**: Since Stark's legal counsel believes that it is ""reasonably possible"" that there will be an unfavorable outcome, this indicates that the company should disclose the contingent liability but not accrue it. Accrual is typically reserved for situations where the outcome is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

2. **Determine the range of damages**: The damages are estimated to range from $100,000 to $150,000. However, since the outcome is only reasonably possible and not probable, Stark should not accrue any amount.

3. **Decide on disclosure**: Since the outcome is reasonably possible, Stark should disclose the contingent liability in the financial statements, indicating the range of potential damages ($100,000 to $150,000).

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that Stark should not accrue any amount but should disclose the contingent liability in the range of $100,000 to $150,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the amount of revenues that Best County should report in its capital projects fund at the end of the year, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the sources of revenue that are considered for the capital projects fund. In this case, the receipts include:
   - Transfer from the general fund: $100,000
   - Federal capital grant: $75,000
   - Special assessment for capital improvements: $300,000

2. Assess which of these receipts are classified as revenues for the capital projects fund. Typically, transfers from the general fund are not considered revenue in the capital projects fund, while federal grants and special assessments are.

3. Calculate the total revenue by adding the federal capital grant and the special assessment:
   - Federal capital grant: $75,000
   - Special assessment for capital improvements: $300,000
   - Total revenue = $75,000 + $300,000 = $375,000

Thus, the amount of revenues that Best County should report in its capital projects fund at the end of the year is $375,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: ""Verify that the financial information supplied by the entity agrees with the books of original entry."" - This step is typically part of the audit process but may not be a requirement before compiling financial statements.

2. **Option b**: ""Perform preliminary analytical procedures to identify accounts that may represent specific risks relevant to the engagement."" - This is a common practice in the planning phase of an engagement, as it helps the accountant understand potential areas of concern.

3. **Option c**: ""Make inquiries of management concerning the entity's procedures used in adjusting and closing the books of account."" - This is also a reasonable step, as understanding management's processes can provide insight into the reliability of the financial information.

4. **Option d**: ""Obtain an understanding of any specialized financial reporting frameworks and practices used in the entity's industry."" - This is crucial for ensuring that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with the relevant framework, especially for nonissuers.

After evaluating these options, the most appropriate step that an accountant is required to take prior to compiling financial statements is to obtain an understanding of any specialized financial reporting frameworks and practices used in the entity's industry, as this is essential for accurate financial reporting.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the implications of the client's request not to confirm a certain account receivable. The auditor must ensure that they still obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the account.

Next, I will evaluate the options provided:
a) Verifying the account balance by inspecting bank statements and cash receipt records could provide alternative evidence, but it may not fully replace the confirmation process.
b) Selecting a different account for confirmation could be a valid approach if the new account is similar in size and risk, but it does not address the specific account in question.
c) Requesting management to document the matter in the management representation letter is a good practice, as it formalizes the client's reasoning, but it does not provide direct evidence.
d) Explaining to the client that their request could lead to a disclaimer of opinion emphasizes the importance of confirmation but may not be the most constructive approach.

Considering these points, the best course of action is to verify the account balance through alternative means, as this allows the auditor to gather necessary evidence without disregarding the client's valid request.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the situation regarding the contingent liability. Dari Inc. has a guarantee for a related party's debt and has determined that it is probable they will need to pay between $150,000 and $200,000. However, no specific amount within that range is more likely than the others.

Next, according to accounting principles, when a range of amounts is given for a contingent liability and no amount within that range is more likely, the company should accrue the minimum amount of the range. In this case, the minimum amount is $150,000.

Finally, I will conclude that the amount of contingent liability that Dari should accrue in its December 31 balance sheet is $150,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the context of the problem. The manager is trying to increase profitability but is facing a limitation due to the capacity of a critical machine. This suggests that the decision-making technique should focus on optimizing operations and addressing constraints.

Next, I will evaluate the options:
a) Theory of constraints focuses on identifying and managing bottlenecks in processes to improve overall performance and profitability. This seems relevant to the manager's situation with limited machine capacity.
b) Economic order quantity is primarily concerned with inventory management and does not directly address operational constraints.
c) Balanced scorecard is a strategic planning tool that measures organizational performance but does not specifically target operational constraints.
d) Cost-variance analysis helps in understanding the differences between expected and actual costs but does not directly address capacity issues.

Given this analysis, the most suitable technique for the manager's situation is the Theory of Constraints, as it directly addresses the limitation of the critical machine and aims to improve profitability by optimizing the use of that resource.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine whether the exchange has commercial substance, I need to consider the implications of the exchange on future cash flows. 

1. First, I need to understand that an exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. This means that the economic position of the entity will be altered due to the transaction.

2. Next, I can analyze the options provided. Option (a) is about comparing book value and fair value, which does not directly address future cash flows. Option (b) discusses gain on the exchange, but it does not focus on the significance of future cash flows. Option (d) relates to tax implications, which is not relevant to the concept of commercial substance.

3. Therefore, the most relevant question to determine if the exchange has commercial substance is whether the future cash flows are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the relationship between inflation, cost of equity, and stock price. The cost of equity is often influenced by the expected inflation rate. When inflation decreases, the cost of equity typically decreases as well because investors require a lower return when inflation is lower.

Next, since the analyst expects a dividend of $5 with a growth rate of 3%, the expected future cash flows from the dividend will be more valuable if the cost of equity decreases. This is because the present value of future cash flows is inversely related to the discount rate (cost of equity).

Finally, if the cost of equity decreases, the present value of the expected dividends will increase, leading to a likely increase in the stock price. Therefore, the correct answer is that the cost of equity will likely decrease, which supports the idea that the stock price will likely increase.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To find the standard deviation of an equally weighted portfolio consisting of Stocks A and B, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the weights and standard deviations**: Since the portfolio is equally weighted, the weight for each stock (A and B) is 0.5. The standard deviations are given as:
   - σ_A = 6% = 0.06
   - σ_B = 18% = 0.18

2. **Use the formula for the standard deviation of a two-asset portfolio**: The formula for the standard deviation of a portfolio with two assets is:
   \[
   \sigma_P = \sqrt{w_A^2 \sigma_A^2 + w_B^2 \sigma_B^2 + 2 w_A w_B \sigma_A \sigma_B \rho_{AB}}
   \]
   where:
   - \( w_A \) and \( w_B \) are the weights of Stocks A and B,
   - \( \sigma_A \) and \( \sigma_B \) are the standard deviations of Stocks A and B,
   - \( \rho_{AB} \) is the correlation between the two stocks.

3. **Plug in the values**: Since both weights are 0.5, the equation simplifies to:
   \[
   \sigma_P = \sqrt{(0.5^2 \cdot 0.06^2) + (0.5^2 \cdot 0.18^2) + (2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.06 \cdot 0.18 \cdot 0.2)}
   \]
   Calculating each term:
   - \( 0.5^2 \cdot 0.06^2 = 0.25 \cdot 0.0036 = 0.0009 \)
   - \( 0.5^2 \cdot 0.18^2 = 0.25 \cdot 0.0324 = 0.0081 \)
   - \( 2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.06 \cdot 0.18 \cdot 0.2 = 0.25 \cdot 0.06 \cdot 0.18 \cdot 0.2 = 0.25 \cdot 0.00216 = 0.00054 \)

   Now, summing these values:
   \[
   \sigma_P^2 = 0.0009 + 0.0081 + 0.00054 = 0.00954
   \]
   Taking the square root gives:
   \[
   \sigma_P = \sqrt{0.00954} \approx 0.0977 \text{ or } 9.77\%
   \]

Thus, the standard deviation of the portfolio is approximately 9.70%. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the amount Mentor Co. should recognize as a foreign currency gain in its income statement, I need to analyze the two types of currency adjustments mentioned: remeasurement and translation.

1. **Remeasurement Gain**: This gain of $25,000 arises from converting the financial statements of the Swiss corporation into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rate. This gain is recognized in the income statement.

2. **Translation Gain**: This gain of $40,000 results from translating the financial statements of the Swiss corporation into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate. However, translation gains are typically recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and not in the income statement.

3. **Total Foreign Currency Gain**: Since only the remeasurement gain is recognized in the income statement, the total foreign currency gain that Mentor should recognize is just the remeasurement gain of $25,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to convert the production cost from pesos to U.S. dollars. The cost to produce the product is 116.50 pesos. Using the exchange rate of 0.1099 U.S. dollars per peso, the cost in U.S. dollars is:

116.50 pesos * 0.1099 USD/peso = 12.83 USD (approximately).

Next, I need to convert the selling price from euros to U.S. dollars. The product sells for 20 euros. Using the exchange rate of 0.8928 U.S. dollars per euro, the selling price in U.S. dollars is:

20 euros * 0.8928 USD/euro = 17.86 USD (approximately).

Now, I can calculate the profit by subtracting the production cost in U.S. dollars from the selling price in U.S. dollars:

Profit = Selling Price - Production Cost = 17.86 USD - 12.83 USD = 5.03 USD (approximately).

Since the closest option to 5.03 USD is 5.06 USD, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to determine the unrealized gain or loss on the available-for-sale securities. The cost basis of the securities is $24,000, and the fair value is $30,000. 

Next, I calculate the unrealized gain: 
Unrealized Gain = Fair Value - Cost Basis = $30,000 - $24,000 = $6,000.

Since these are available-for-sale securities, the unrealized gains or losses are not recognized in the income statement but are instead reported in other comprehensive income. Therefore, the amount recognized in the income statement is $0.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which statement is true of equity but not of bonds, let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a**: ""They can be issued by firms."" - Both equity (stocks) and bonds can be issued by firms, so this statement is not exclusive to equity.

2. **Option b**: ""Their payouts (i.e. dividend or coupons) are made after corporation tax has already been deducted."" - Dividends (equity payouts) are paid from profits after tax, while bond coupons are paid before tax is deducted from the firm's earnings. This statement is true for equity and not for bonds.

3. **Option c**: ""Their payouts (i.e. dividends or coupons) are made before corporation tax has been deducted."" - This is true for bond coupons, as they are paid before tax, but not for equity dividends, which are paid after tax. Therefore, this statement is not true for equity.

4. **Option d**: ""They can be traded on the secondary market."" - Both equity and bonds can be traded on the secondary market, so this statement is also not exclusive to equity.

After analyzing all options, the correct answer is option b, as it is true for equity but not for bonds. Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to determine the value of the exchange offer from Company X to Company Y. Company X is offering three-fourths of a share of its stock for each share of Company Y. 

Next, I calculate the value of three-fourths of a share of Company X's stock. Since the market price of Company X is $45 per share, the value of three-fourths of a share is:
(3/4) * $45 = $33.75.

Now, I compare this value to the market price of Company Y, which is $30. The ratio of the market price of the exchange offer (value of X's stock offered) to the market price of Company Y is:
$33.75 / $30 = 1.125.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the elements of a CPA firm's quality control system. These typically include policies and procedures related to client acceptance, personnel management, professional development, and monitoring.

Next, I will analyze each option:
a) Deciding whether to accept or continue a client relationship is a key element of quality control, as it ensures that the firm only works with clients that meet certain standards.
b) Selecting personnel for advancement who have the necessary qualifications is also an important aspect of quality control, as it ensures that the firm has competent staff.
c) Assessing a client's ability to establish effective internal controls is more related to the client's operations rather than the CPA firm's internal quality control system.
d) Monitoring the effectiveness of professional development activities is crucial for maintaining the quality of services provided by the firm.

Based on this analysis, option c does not pertain to the CPA firm's quality control system. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine Strom's basis in Ace Partnership, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the initial basis from the contribution**: Strom contributed land with an adjusted basis of $16,000. This amount is the starting point for his basis in the partnership.

2. **Consider the assumption of liabilities**: The land was subject to a $24,000 mortgage, which was assumed by Ace Partnership. When a partner contributes property subject to a liability, the partner's basis is reduced by their share of the liability. Since Strom has a 25% interest in Ace, his share of the liability is 25% of $24,000, which is $6,000.

3. **Calculate the final basis**: The final basis in the partnership is calculated as follows:
   - Initial basis from the land: $16,000
   - Less Strom's share of the liability: $6,000
   - Final basis = $16,000 - $6,000 = $10,000.

However, since the question does not provide an option for $10,000, I need to consider the fair market value of the land. The fair market value does not directly affect the basis calculation but is relevant for understanding the overall contribution.

Since the options provided do not include $10,000, I will check if any of the options could be correct based on the adjusted basis and liabilities. The closest option that reflects the adjusted basis without considering the liability would be $16,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, the CPA needs to assess the implications of the omitted accounts receivable confirmations on the reliability of the financial statements. Since the omitted accounts are material, this raises concerns about the accuracy of the financial statements.

Next, the CPA should consider the appropriate course of action to address the issue. Bringing the matter to the attention of the board of directors or audit committee is important, but it may not be the immediate action required to rectify the situation.

Then, the CPA should perform alternative procedures to verify the account balances. This step is crucial to ensure that the financial statements are accurate and reliable, especially since the confirmation process was incomplete.

Therefore, the most immediate action the CPA should take is to perform alternative procedures to verify account balances. This will help in determining whether the financial statements need to be adjusted based on the findings.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine how many DVD players need to be sold for the company to break even, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the contribution margin for each product**:
   - For DVD players: Selling price = $200, Variable cost = $160. 
     Contribution margin per DVD player = $200 - $160 = $40.
   - For home entertainment systems: Selling price = $600, Variable cost = $460. 
     Contribution margin per home entertainment system = $600 - $460 = $140.

2. **Determine the sales mix**:
   - The company sells 4 DVD players for every 1 home entertainment system. Therefore, for every 5 units sold (4 DVD players + 1 home entertainment system), the contribution margin is:
     - Contribution from 4 DVD players = 4 * $40 = $160.
     - Contribution from 1 home entertainment system = 1 * $140 = $140.
     - Total contribution margin for 5 units = $160 + $140 = $300.

3. **Calculate the break-even point**:
   - The break-even point in terms of total contribution margin needed to cover fixed costs is:
     Fixed costs = $90,000.
   - Break-even point in units (total contribution margin) = Fixed costs / Total contribution margin per 5 units = $90,000 / $300 = 300 sets of 5 units.
   - Since each set consists of 4 DVD players, the total number of DVD players needed = 300 sets * 4 DVD players/set = 1200 DVD players.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to calculate the net income using the return on total assets (ROA). The ROA is given as 8 percent, and the total assets are $300,000. Therefore, the net income can be calculated as follows:

Net Income = ROA * Total Assets = 0.08 * $300,000 = $24,000.

Next, I will use the net profit margin to find the sales. The net profit margin is given as 5 percent, which means that net income is 5 percent of sales. We can express this relationship as:

Net Income = Net Profit Margin * Sales.

Rearranging this gives us:

Sales = Net Income / Net Profit Margin = $24,000 / 0.05 = $480,000.

Thus, the sales for Felton Farm Supplies, Inc. are $480,000. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the requirements for financial statements prepared on an income tax basis and how they relate to GAAP. The differences between the income tax basis and GAAP must be disclosed to provide clarity to users of the financial statements.

Next, I need to consider the specific requirements for disclosures. Generally, when financial statements are prepared on a basis other than GAAP, the effects of the differences must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. This is to ensure that users are aware of how the financial statements differ from GAAP.

Finally, I need to determine if there are any requirements for the auditor's report regarding these differences. While the auditor may mention the basis of preparation in their report, the detailed quantification of the differences is typically included in the notes rather than the auditor's report itself.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that the dollar amount of the effects of the difference between the income tax basis and GAAP is required to be included only in the notes to the financial statements.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze the implications of using a blank form of positive accounts receivable confirmation. A blank confirmation requests the recipient to fill in the amount they owe, which can lead to certain challenges.

Next, I consider the options provided. Option (a) suggests that not all accounts have an equal chance of being selected for confirmation, which is not directly related to the effectiveness of the blank form itself. Option (b) mentions that unconfirmed accounts may have been written off, which is a concern but does not specifically address the blank form's effectiveness. 

Option (c) states that few responses may occur because more effort is required from recipients, which is a valid concern as it can lead to lower response rates. Finally, option (d) indicates that accounts confirmed may not represent the entire population, which is also a significant issue but is more about the representativeness of the sample rather than the blank form's effectiveness.

Considering these points, the most relevant concern regarding the effectiveness of the blank form is that it may lead to fewer responses due to the additional effort required from recipients. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To find Gamma's profit margin on sales, I will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the relationship between return on assets (ROA), asset turnover, and profit margin**: The formula for ROA is given by:
   \[
   \text{ROA} = \text{Profit Margin} \times \text{Asset Turnover}
   \]
   where:
   - ROA = Return on Assets
   - Profit Margin = Net Income / Sales
   - Asset Turnover = Sales / Total Assets

2. **Substitute the known values into the formula**: We know that ROA is 10% (or 0.10) and the asset turnover is 4:1. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   0.10 = \text{Profit Margin} \times 4
   \]

3. **Solve for the profit margin**: Rearranging the equation gives:
   \[
   \text{Profit Margin} = \frac{0.10}{4} = 0.025
   \]
   To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   \[
   \text{Profit Margin} = 0.025 \times 100 = 2.5\%
   \]

Now, looking at the choices provided, the closest match to 2.5% is option d) 0.025.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to determine the total number of shares after the stock dividend is declared. The company has 1,000 shares outstanding and declares a 30% stock dividend, which means they will issue an additional 30% of 1,000 shares. This results in 1,000 * 0.30 = 300 new shares.

Next, I need to calculate the total value of the stock dividend. Since the stock is trading at $10 per share, the total value of the stock dividend is 300 shares * $10 = $3,000.

Now, I need to make the appropriate journal entries. The retained earnings will be debited for the total value of the stock dividend, which is $3,000. The common stock account will be credited for the par value of the new shares issued. The par value is $1 per share, so for 300 new shares, the common stock account will be credited for 300 shares * $1 = $300. The remaining amount will be credited to additional paid-in capital, which is $3,000 - $300 = $2,700.

Based on these calculations, the correct adjustment when recording the stock dividend is that retained earnings is debited for $3,000, which corresponds to the total value of the stock dividend.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which situation would be the most difficult internal control issue for an auditor to detect, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option a**: The accounting staff neglects the control due to increased transactions. This situation may be noticeable through a review of transaction volumes and control adherence, making it somewhat detectable.

2. **Option b**: The technology department writes a program that does not properly implement the control due to a lack of understanding. This could be detected through testing of the software and understanding its design, although it may require technical expertise.

3. **Option c**: Two employees, who work in different departments, are circumventing an internal control. This situation is more challenging because it involves collusion, which is often difficult to detect as it may not leave a clear audit trail.

4. **Option d**: Someone erroneously disables edit checks in a software program designed to identify control exceptions. While this is a serious issue, it may be detected through regular audits of the software and its settings.

After evaluating these options, the most difficult internal control issue for an auditor to detect is likely option c, as collusion between employees can be very subtle and may not be easily identifiable through standard auditing procedures.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the shape of the yield curve based on the given yields of the bonds, I will analyze the yields of the bonds with different maturities.

1. The five-year bond has a yield of 6%, while the ten-year bond has a yield of 5%. This indicates that the yield on the shorter-term bond (5 years) is higher than that of the longer-term bond (10 years).

2. Typically, a normal yield curve is upward sloping, meaning that longer-term bonds have higher yields than shorter-term bonds due to the increased risk and uncertainty over a longer time horizon. However, in this case, the opposite is true.

3. Since the yield on the five-year bond is higher than that of the ten-year bond, this suggests that the yield curve is likely to be downward sloping, indicating that investors expect lower yields in the future for longer maturities.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze each option to determine which one raises the most concern regarding possible illegal acts.

a) Related party transactions, although properly disclosed, were pervasive during the year. - While related party transactions can raise concerns, if they are properly disclosed, they may not necessarily indicate illegal acts.

b) The entity prepared several large checks payable to cash during the year. - This could indicate potential illegal acts, such as money laundering or misappropriation of funds, as large cash transactions can be suspicious.

c) Material internal control weaknesses previously reported to management were not corrected. - This indicates poor governance and risk management but does not directly imply illegal acts.

d) The entity was a campaign contributor to several local political candidates during the year. - While this could raise ethical questions, it is not inherently illegal unless there are violations of campaign finance laws.

Based on this analysis, option b) stands out as the most likely to raise questions concerning possible illegal acts due to the nature of large checks payable to cash. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to determine the eligible gross wages for each employee. Since eligible gross wages are defined as the first $15,000 of gross wages paid to each employee, and each of Boca's four employees earned $20,000, the eligible gross wages for each employee would be $15,000.

Next, I calculate the total eligible gross wages for all four employees:
Total eligible gross wages = 4 employees * $15,000 = $60,000.

Now, since Boca believes that actual unemployment claims will be 2% of eligible gross wages, I will calculate the accrued liability for unemployment claims:
Accrued liability = 2% of total eligible gross wages = 0.02 * $60,000 = $1,200.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which procedure an auditor would most likely complete to test the existence assertion of property, plant, and equipment, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Understanding the Existence Assertion**: The existence assertion ensures that the assets recorded in the financial statements actually exist at the reporting date. This means the auditor needs to verify that the property, plant, and equipment listed are real and not overstated.

2. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - **Option a**: This involves vouching significant additions to original invoices and ensuring they have been placed in service. This directly relates to verifying that the assets exist and are operational.
   - **Option b**: This focuses on ensuring items are appropriately capitalized, which is more about classification than existence.
   - **Option c**: This involves verifying that items are recorded in the proper period, which relates to timing rather than existence.
   - **Option d**: This checks for consistency in depreciation methods, which is related to valuation and not existence.

3. **Conclusion**: The most relevant procedure for testing the existence assertion is option a, as it directly involves verifying the existence of significant additions through original invoices and confirming they are in service.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which option is the exception regarding nonaudit services that an auditor may provide without impairing independence, I will analyze each choice step by step.

1. **Choice a** states that nonaudit services with revenues in aggregate of less than 5% of the total revenues paid by the issuer to the auditor during the fiscal year are permissible. This is generally acceptable under independence rules.

2. **Choice b** mentions that nonaudit services that were promptly brought to the attention of, and approved by, the audit committee prior to the completion of the audit are allowed. This aligns with the requirement for audit committee preapproval.

3. **Choice c** refers to nonaudit services to perform financial information systems design and implementation. This type of service is typically prohibited as it can create a conflict of interest and impair independence.

4. **Choice d** states that services that the issuer did not recognize as nonaudit services at the time of the engagement are also questionable. However, this does not inherently impair independence as long as the services are not prohibited.

Based on this analysis, the option that does not align with the rules regarding nonaudit services and independence is **Choice c**.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the responsibilities of an accountant conducting a review of interim financial information. A review is generally less comprehensive than an audit, and the accountant's role is to provide limited assurance rather than an opinion.

Next, I will evaluate each option:
a) This statement is true for audits but not specifically for reviews, as reviews do not require the same level of detail regarding consistency with prior periods.
b) This is incorrect because, in a review, the accountant does not express an opinion on the financial statements as a whole; instead, they provide limited assurance.
c) This statement is true; maintaining independence is crucial for all engagements, including reviews.
d) This is misleading because while the accountant does need to obtain evidence, the level of assurance is not as high as in an audit, and the procedures performed are not designed to afford a reasonable basis for an opinion.

Based on this analysis, the most applicable statement regarding an accountant conducting a review of interim financial information is option c.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to determine the basis for the child when they receive the securities. The adjusted basis of the securities is $10,000, but since the fair market value (FMV) at the time of the gift is $9,000, the child's basis will be the lower of the two when the securities are sold for less than the FMV.

Next, since the child sold the securities for $7,000, which is less than the FMV of $9,000, the child's basis for the securities sold will be the amount realized from the sale, which is $7,000.

Finally, since the sale price is less than the FMV, the child's basis for the securities sold is $7,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the nature of the CPA's engagement. In an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the CPA performs specific procedures that the parties have agreed upon, and the report typically does not provide an opinion but rather states the findings based on those procedures.

Next, I need to consider what the CPA's report should include. Since the CPA is not providing an opinion on the overall fairness of the financial statements or the effectiveness of internal controls, the report will not contain an opinion or a separate paragraph on those matters.

Finally, the CPA's report will include a disclaimer of responsibility for the sufficiency of the procedures performed, as the responsibility for determining the sufficiency of the procedures lies with the parties who engaged the CPA.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To analyze the statements regarding investment projects, I will evaluate each option step by step.

1. **Option a**: ""The ranking of projects by NPV is invariant to changes in the market rate."" This statement is incorrect because the Net Present Value (NPV) is sensitive to the discount rate (market rate). Changes in the market rate can affect the NPV of projects differently, potentially altering their ranking.

2. **Option b**: ""The IRR will always agree with NPV metric."" This statement is not always true. While IRR and NPV can lead to the same decision in many cases, there are situations (especially with non-conventional cash flows) where they can give conflicting rankings.

3. **Option c**: ""The IRR never changes the ranking of the projects."" This statement is misleading. The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) can change the ranking of projects, especially when comparing projects with different scales or cash flow patterns.

4. **Option d**: ""We should use a single metric, like the NPV or the IRR, to have a coherent comparison."" This statement is somewhat misleading as well. While using a single metric can simplify decision-making, relying solely on one metric can lead to incomplete analysis. It is often recommended to consider multiple metrics for a more comprehensive evaluation.

After evaluating all options, the most accurate conclusion is that none of the statements are entirely correct. However, if I must choose the least incorrect option, it would be option b, as it is the most commonly accepted in practice, despite its limitations.

Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which nonaudit service an accounting firm is permitted to provide for an issuer audit client without impairing independence under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option a**: Providing an expert opinion in order to advocate the client's interest in litigation. This service could impair independence because it involves advocating for the client, which is generally prohibited.

2. **Option b**: Providing an expert opinion in order to advocate the client's position in a regulatory investigation. Similar to option a, this involves advocacy, which could impair independence.

3. **Option c**: Providing factual accounts in testimony explaining positions taken during the performance of any services provided to the client. This option does not involve advocacy but rather providing factual information, which is generally permissible and does not impair independence.

4. **Option d**: Providing legal services to the client in a foreign jurisdiction. This could potentially impair independence, especially if the legal services are related to the audit or financial reporting.

Based on this analysis, the only option that does not impair the accounting firm's independence is option c.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the lowest price per unit at which Match should be willing to sell the 5000 units to Reno, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify Relevant Costs**: Since there are no shipping costs for the special order, I will only consider the variable costs associated with producing the units. The relevant costs per unit are:
   - Direct materials: $60
   - Direct labor: $10
   - Variable overhead: $40
   - Total variable cost per unit = $60 + $10 + $40 = $110

2. **Fixed Costs**: The fixed overhead of $30 per unit and the fixed licensing fee of $50,000 are not relevant for this special order since they do not change with the production of the additional units. The fixed costs are already incurred and will not affect the decision to accept the special order.

3. **Determine Minimum Selling Price**: The lowest price per unit that Match should be willing to sell the 5000 units is equal to the total variable cost per unit, which is $110.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the amount Pine Co. should capitalize as the cost of the completed factory building, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify all costs that should be capitalized**: The costs that should be capitalized include the purchase price of the land, the cost of razing the old building, title insurance and legal fees, architect's fees, and the construction cost of the new building.

2. **Calculate the total capitalized costs**:
   - Purchase price of land: $450,000
   - Cost of razing old building: $60,000
   - Title insurance and legal fees: $30,000
   - Architect's fees: $95,000
   - New building construction cost: $1,850,000

   Now, I will sum these amounts:
   \[
   450,000 + 60,000 + 30,000 + 95,000 + 1,850,000 = 2,005,000
   \]

3. **Final amount to capitalize**: The total amount that Pine Co. should capitalize as the cost of the completed factory building is $2,005,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze the changes in the carrying amount of the land over the two years. In year 1, the land was acquired for $100,000 but was revalued down to $90,000, which means there was a decrease in value of $10,000 that would typically be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI).

Next, in year 2, the land was revalued up to $105,000. This represents an increase of $15,000 from the carrying amount of $90,000 at the end of year 1. According to IFRS, when there is a revaluation increase, it should first reverse any previous revaluation decrease recognized in OCI. Therefore, the first $10,000 of the increase will be recognized in profit or loss to reverse the previous loss.

The remaining $5,000 of the increase will be recognized in other comprehensive income, as it exceeds the amount needed to reverse the previous decrease.

Finally, I can summarize the accounting treatment: $10,000 will be recognized in profit or loss, and $5,000 will be recognized in other comprehensive income.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To find Duct's target selling price, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Costs per Unit**: 
   - Variable Manufacturing Costs = $12
   - Variable Selling & Admin Costs = $3
   - Total Variable Costs = $12 + $3 = $15
   - Fixed Costs per Unit: Since fixed costs are not dependent on the number of units sold, we will not include them in the per unit calculation for the target selling price.

2. **Determine the Contribution Margin**: 
   - The contribution margin is defined as the selling price minus the variable costs. Given that the target contribution margin is 20%, we can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Contribution Margin} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Variable Costs}
   \]
   - We know that the contribution margin should be 20% of the selling price, so:
   \[
   \text{Contribution Margin} = 0.20 \times \text{Selling Price}
   \]

3. **Set Up the Equation**: 
   - We can set up the equation based on the contribution margin:
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} - 15 = 0.20 \times \text{Selling Price}
   \]
   - Rearranging gives:
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} - 0.20 \times \text{Selling Price} = 15
   \]
   \[
   0.80 \times \text{Selling Price} = 15
   \]
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \frac{15}{0.80} = 18.75
   \]

Thus, the target selling price for Duct is $18.75. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To find the dividend growth rate that ensures the price of the stock is consistent with the pricing of a growing perpetuity, I will use the Gordon Growth Model (also known as the Dividend Discount Model for a perpetuity). The formula is:

\[ P = \frac{D_0(1 + g)}{r - g} \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the current price of the stock ($75),
- \( D_0 \) is the last dividend paid ($3),
- \( g \) is the growth rate of the dividend,
- \( r \) is the required return (12% or 0.12).

First, I will rearrange the formula to solve for \( g \):

\[ 75 = \frac{3(1 + g)}{0.12 - g} \]

Next, I will multiply both sides by \( (0.12 - g) \):

\[ 75(0.12 - g) = 3(1 + g) \]

Expanding both sides gives:

\[ 9 - 75g = 3 + 3g \]

Now, I will combine like terms:

\[ 9 - 3 = 75g + 3g \]
\[ 6 = 78g \]

Now, I will solve for \( g \):

\[ g = \frac{6}{78} = \frac{1}{13} \approx 0.0769 \text{ or } 7.69\% \]

Since this value is not one of the options, I will check the closest option. The closest option to 7.69% is 8%.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the requirements for financial statements of voluntary health and welfare nongovernmental not-for-profit organizations. These organizations are typically required to report expenses in a way that provides clarity on how resources are utilized.

Next, I need to consider the classifications of expenses. Functional classification refers to the purpose of the expenses (e.g., program services, management and general, fundraising), while natural classification refers to the type of expense (e.g., salaries, rent, utilities).

Finally, according to the guidelines, these organizations must report expenses by both functional and natural classifications to provide a comprehensive view of their financial activities.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand what a capital asset is for federal income tax purposes. Generally, capital assets are properties that are owned for investment or business purposes and are not intended for sale in the ordinary course of business.

Next, I will evaluate each option:
a) Accounts receivable are amounts owed to the business and are typically classified as current assets, not capital assets.
b) Marketable securities are investments that can be easily sold and are also not classified as capital assets in the context of business operations.
c) Machinery and equipment used in a business are long-term assets that are essential for operations and are classified as capital assets.
d) Inventory consists of goods available for sale and is considered a current asset, not a capital asset.

Based on this analysis, the correct classification of a capital asset for federal income tax purposes is machinery and equipment used in a business.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the options provided in the context of COSO's framework for ethical behavior. 

a) Demonstrating appropriate behavior by example is a fundamental principle of ethical leadership. Leaders who model ethical behavior set a standard for others to follow, which can effectively transmit a message of ethics throughout the organization.

b) Strengthening internal audit’s ability to deter and report improper behavior is important for accountability but may not directly transmit a message of ethical behavior to all employees.

c) Removing pressures to meet unrealistic targets can help create an ethical environment, but it does not actively transmit a message of ethical behavior.

d) Specifying competence levels for jobs ensures that employees have the necessary skills, but it does not directly address the transmission of ethical behavior.

After considering these points, the most effective method to transmit a message of ethical behavior throughout an organization is clearly option a, as it emphasizes the importance of leading by example.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine how Bailey Co. should report the insurance transaction in the current year's financial statements after changing from cash basis to accrual basis, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total insurance expense**: Bailey Co. purchased a four-year insurance policy for $240,000. This means the annual insurance expense is $240,000 / 4 = $60,000.

2. **Determine the amount to be recognized in the current year**: Since Bailey is now using the accrual basis, they need to recognize the insurance expense for the current year. For the current year, they should recognize $60,000 as an insurance expense.

3. **Calculate the prepaid insurance**: Since the policy covers four years, and one year has already been recognized as an expense, the remaining prepaid insurance for the next three years would be $240,000 - $60,000 = $180,000. This amount should be recorded as a prepaid asset.

Now, let's summarize the journal entries:
- Debit Insurance Expense: $60,000
- Debit Prepaid Insurance: $180,000
- Credit Retained Earnings: $0 (no adjustment needed to retained earnings since the expense is being recognized correctly).

Based on the analysis, the correct reporting in the financial statements would be:
- $60,000 debit to insurance expense
- $180,000 debit to prepaid insurance

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which concern is unique to SaaS, I will analyze each option:

a) Disaster recovery capabilities and documented recovery procedures: This concern is relevant to both SaaS and traditional in-house applications, as both need to ensure data recovery in case of disasters.

b) User credential setup and control over the actions that employees can perform: While this is a concern for both SaaS and in-house applications, SaaS often has different mechanisms for user management, but it is not unique to SaaS.

c) Allocation of software expenses and overhead charged to departments: This concern can apply to both SaaS and traditional applications, as both types of software can have costs allocated to different departments.

d) Ownership of processed data and costs of data migrations: This concern is particularly relevant to SaaS, as companies often have to consider who owns the data when using a third-party service and the potential costs associated with migrating data away from the SaaS provider.

After analyzing the options, the concern that is unique to SaaS is related to ownership of processed data and costs of data migrations.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which situation would not impair objectivity, integrity, or independence with respect to an audit client, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option a**: An auditor takes the client’s audit committee to Las Vegas for the weekend. 
   - This situation could impair objectivity as it involves a significant gift or entertainment that may create a sense of obligation or bias.

2. **Option b**: An out-of-town client takes the audit engagement team out to dinner at a renowned local restaurant.
   - This situation is more common and typically considered acceptable as long as it is not extravagant and does not create a significant influence over the auditors' judgment.

3. **Option c**: An auditor provides client management with box seats for the season at a major league baseball franchise.
   - This situation would likely impair independence as it involves providing a significant gift that could create a conflict of interest.

4. **Option d**: A client takes the audit engagement team on a two-day ski trip after the audit team worked for two consecutive weekends.
   - This situation could also impair objectivity due to the nature and duration of the trip, which may create a sense of obligation.

After analyzing all options, option b appears to be the least likely to impair objectivity, integrity, or independence, as it is a common practice for clients to take auditors out for meals, provided it is reasonable.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the role of a service organization and the importance of the service auditor's report in the context of an audit. The service auditor's report provides assurance about the controls in place at the service organization, which can significantly impact the audit of the client using those services.

Next, I should consider the efficiency of the audit process. Reviewing the service auditor's report is generally a more efficient approach than conducting a full audit of the service organization's controls, as it allows the user auditor to rely on the work already done by the service auditor.

Finally, I need to evaluate the options provided. Option (a) suggests reviewing the service auditor’s report on controls, which is a standard and efficient procedure. Option (b) involves outlining the accounting system in a memo, which may not directly contribute to the efficiency of the audit. Option (c) suggests auditing the service organization’s controls, which is less efficient if the service auditor's report is available. Option (d) also suggests auditing the controls, which again is not the most efficient use of resources.

Based on this analysis, the most efficient procedure to include in the audit plan is to review the service auditor’s report on controls placed in operations.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine Vinton's basis in the apartment building, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount realized from the exchange**: The amount realized is the fair market value of the property received (the apartment building) minus the mortgage assumed. The FMV of the apartment building is $550,000, and Vinton assumed the $230,000 mortgage. Therefore, the amount realized is:
   \[
   550,000 - 230,000 = 320,000
   \]

2. **Determine the basis of the unimproved land**: The basis of the unimproved land is $300,000. However, we also need to consider the mortgage on the land. The mortgage of $100,000 is considered when calculating the gain or loss on the exchange.

3. **Calculate the basis in the apartment building**: The basis in the property received (apartment building) is generally the basis of the property given up (unimproved land) plus any gain recognized. In this case, since Vinton is exchanging property and assuming the mortgage, we need to adjust the basis:
   \[
   \text{Basis in apartment building} = \text{Basis of unimproved land} - \text{Mortgage on unimproved land} + \text{Mortgage on apartment building}
   \]
   \[
   = 300,000 - 100,000 + 230,000 = 430,000
   \]

Thus, Vinton's basis in the apartment building is $430,000. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the context of the question, which is about obtaining evidence regarding the effectiveness of a control when there is no written documentation available. 

Next, I consider the options provided:
a) Mailing confirmations - This is typically used to verify information from third parties, not directly related to internal controls.
b) Inquiry and other procedures such as observation - This involves directly asking personnel about the control and observing its operation, which can provide evidence of effectiveness.
c) Analytical procedures - These involve evaluating financial information through analysis, but they may not directly assess the effectiveness of a control.
d) Recalculating the balance in related accounts - This is more about verifying account balances rather than assessing control effectiveness.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate choice for obtaining evidence about the control’s effectiveness without written documentation is option b, as it involves direct inquiry and observation of the control in action.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To calculate Lake Trust's distributable net income (DNI), I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Income**: This includes all income items except for capital gains allocable to corpus. The income items are:
   - Dividend income: $2,500
   - Taxable interest income: $2,000
   - Total income = $2,500 + $2,000 = $4,500

2. **Subtract Expenses Allocable to Income**: The expenses that can be deducted from the total income are:
   - Accounting fees: $500
   - Trustee fees: $750
   - Total expenses = $500 + $750 = $1,250

3. **Calculate Distributable Net Income (DNI)**: 
   - DNI = Total income - Total expenses
   - DNI = $4,500 - $1,250 = $3,250

Thus, the distributable net income for Lake Trust is $3,250. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine when an auditor of a nonissuer may not issue a qualified opinion, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option a**: If the auditor lacks independence with respect to the entity, they cannot issue any opinion, including a qualified opinion. Independence is a fundamental requirement for auditors, and lacking it would lead to a disclaimer of opinion rather than a qualified opinion.

2. **Option b**: If management prevents the auditor from observing the entity's inventory, this situation may lead to a qualified opinion due to a scope limitation. The auditor can still issue a qualified opinion if they believe the rest of the financial statements are fairly presented.

3. **Option c**: The omission of the statement of cash flows from the financial statements is a departure from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The auditor can issue a qualified opinion in this case, indicating that the financial statements are not in accordance with GAAP.

4. **Option d**: If the auditor's report refers to the work of an actuary, this does not prevent the auditor from issuing a qualified opinion. The auditor can still express their opinion based on the overall financial statements, even if they rely on the work of specialists.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that an auditor may not issue a qualified opinion when they lack independence with respect to the entity.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which factor is an inherent limitation to an entity's internal control, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option a: The ineffectiveness of the entity's audit committee.** 
   - While an ineffective audit committee can weaken internal controls, it is not an inherent limitation. It is more of a result of management decisions and can potentially be improved.

2. **Option b: Collusion of employees in circumventing internal controls.**
   - Collusion is a significant risk that can undermine internal controls. However, it is not an inherent limitation; rather, it is a risk that arises from human behavior and can occur despite the presence of controls.

3. **Option c: The lack of resources to monitor internal controls.**
   - This factor indicates a limitation in the entity's ability to implement and maintain effective controls. However, it is not inherently a limitation of the control system itself but rather a resource issue.

4. **Option d: The complexity of the entity's electronic order processing system.**
   - Complexity in systems can lead to inherent limitations in internal controls because complicated systems are more prone to errors and may be difficult to monitor effectively. This complexity is an inherent characteristic of the system itself.

After analyzing all options, the most likely inherent limitation to an entity's internal control is the complexity of the electronic order processing system.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To calculate the effective annual interest cost for the Houser Company, we need to consider the interest on the borrowed amount, the compensating balance requirement, and the commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit line.

1. **Calculate the interest on the borrowed amount**: 
   The company borrows $200,000 at an interest rate of 10%. 
   Interest = $200,000 * 10% = $20,000.

2. **Calculate the compensating balance**: 
   The agreement requires a 15% compensating balance on the total credit line of $500,000. 
   Compensating balance = 15% of $500,000 = $75,000. 
   Since the company is borrowing $200,000, it must maintain this compensating balance, which means it effectively has less available for use.

3. **Calculate the commitment fee on the unused amount**: 
   The unused amount of the credit line is $500,000 - $200,000 = $300,000. 
   The commitment fee is 1% of the unused amount. 
   Commitment fee = 1% of $300,000 = $3,000.

4. **Calculate the total cost of borrowing**: 
   The total cost of borrowing includes the interest and the commitment fee. 
   Total cost = Interest + Commitment fee = $20,000 + $3,000 = $23,000.

5. **Calculate the effective interest cost**: 
   The effective interest cost is calculated based on the actual amount available for use, which is the borrowed amount minus the compensating balance. 
   Effective amount available = $200,000 - $75,000 = $125,000. 
   The effective interest rate is then calculated as:
   Effective interest rate = Total cost / Effective amount available = $23,000 / $125,000 = 0.184 or 18.4%.

However, we need to consider the total amount borrowed, which is $200,000, and the effective interest cost should be calculated based on the total amount borrowed, including the compensating balance.

6. **Final calculation**: 
   The effective annual interest cost can be calculated as:
   Effective interest cost = Total cost / Total borrowed amount = $23,000 / $200,000 = 0.115 or 11.5%.

Thus, the effective annual interest cost if the firm borrows $200,000 for one year is closest to 11.5 percent.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand how acquisition costs are treated in accounting. Acquisition costs related to the purchase of net assets are typically capitalized as part of the total cost of the acquisition.

Next, I need to consider the options provided. Option (a) suggests allocating the costs to nonmonetary assets, which is not the standard treatment for acquisition costs. Option (b) mentions capitalizing the costs as part of goodwill, which is relevant if the acquisition results in goodwill. Option (c) suggests capitalizing the costs as an other asset and amortizing them, which is not typically how acquisition costs are treated. Option (d) suggests expensing the costs, which is also not correct for acquisition costs.

Given that acquisition costs are generally capitalized as part of the total acquisition cost, which may include goodwill if applicable, the most appropriate choice is option (b).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To find the expected value to Smith of the lawsuit, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the potential awards and their probabilities**: 
   - If the award is $100,000 (with a probability of 0.7), Smith will receive 40% of the amount over $20,000. The amount over $20,000 is $100,000 - $20,000 = $80,000. Therefore, Smith's share from this award is 0.4 * $80,000 = $32,000.
   - If the award is $0 (with a probability of 0.3), Smith will receive nothing.

2. **Calculate the expected value of the awards**:
   - The expected value from the $100,000 award is 0.7 * $32,000 = $22,400.
   - The expected value from the $0 award is 0.3 * $0 = $0.
   - Therefore, the total expected value from the awards is $22,400 + $0 = $22,400.

3. **Account for the retainer and out-of-pocket expenditures**:
   - Smith pays a retainer of $20,000 and incurs out-of-pocket expenditures of $15,000, totaling $35,000 in costs.
   - The expected value to Smith is the expected award minus the total costs: $22,400 - $35,000 = -$12,600.

Since the expected value is negative, it indicates a loss. However, the question asks for the expected value to Smith, which is the expected award minus the retainer and expenditures.

Thus, the expected value to Smith of the lawsuit is $22,400 - $35,000 = -$12,600, which does not match any of the provided options. 

However, if we consider only the expected award without subtracting costs, the expected value of the award is $22,400. 

Since none of the options match this calculation, I will assume the question is asking for the expected value of the award itself, which is $22,400. 

Therefore, the closest option that reflects a positive expected value is not available, but if we consider the expected value of the award itself, it would be:

{'sol': 'a'}"
"To calculate the holding period return on the bond investment, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total coupon payments received over the holding period**: The bond pays an 8% coupon on a face value of $100, which means the annual coupon payment is 8% of $100 = $8. Since the bond is held for 3 years, the total coupon payments received will be 3 years * $8/year = $24.

2. **Determine the selling price of the bond**: At the end of the third year, the bond is sold for $82.

3. **Calculate the total cash inflow from the investment**: The total cash inflow consists of the total coupon payments received plus the selling price of the bond. Therefore, the total cash inflow is $24 (coupons) + $82 (selling price) = $106.

4. **Calculate the initial investment**: The bond was bought at $104.1.

5. **Calculate the holding period return (HPR)**: The holding period return is calculated as:
   \[
   HPR = \frac{\text{Total Cash Inflow} - \text{Initial Investment}}{\text{Initial Investment}} = \frac{106 - 104.1}{104.1} = \frac{1.9}{104.1} \approx 0.01824 \text{ or } 1.82\%
   \]

Since the closest option to 1.82% is 2%, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To find the value of the tax shield, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the value of the tax shield**: The tax shield can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Tax Shield} = \text{Value of Levered Firm} - \text{Value of Unlevered Firm} - \text{Present Value of Bankruptcy and Agency Costs}
   \]
   Here, the value of the levered firm is $5 million, the value of the unlevered firm is $4.78 million, and the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs is $360,000.

2. **Substituting the values into the formula**:
   \[
   \text{Tax Shield} = 5,000,000 - 4,780,000 - 360,000
   \]

3. **Performing the calculations**:
   \[
   \text{Tax Shield} = 5,000,000 - 4,780,000 = 220,000
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   \text{Tax Shield} = 220,000 - 360,000 = -140,000
   \]
   However, since we are looking for the tax shield value, we only consider the positive value which is $220,000.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the requirements set forth by Treasury Circular 230 regarding the discovery of errors in tax returns. The CPA has a responsibility to address any errors that are discovered after the client has signed and mailed the returns.

Next, I will evaluate the options provided:
a) Documenting the error in the workpapers is important for record-keeping but does not address the immediate need to inform the client or rectify the situation.
b) Preparing an amended return within 30 days of the discovery of the error is a necessary step, but it is not the first action the CPA should take upon discovering the error.
c) Promptly advising the client of the error is crucial as it ensures the client is aware of the situation and can take appropriate action.
d) Resigning from the engagement and cooperating with the successor accountant is not typically required unless there are significant ethical concerns.

Based on these considerations, the most appropriate first step for the CPA is to promptly advise the client of the error, as this aligns with the ethical obligations to keep the client informed.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the implications of the sample results indicating that the sample rate of deviation plus the allowance for sampling risk exceeds the tolerable rate. This suggests that the controls in place may not be effective, leading to a higher risk of material misstatement.

Next, if the auditor finds that the controls are not operating effectively (as indicated by the sample results), they would likely need to adjust their approach to the audit. This typically means that they would have to rely less on the controls and increase their substantive testing to ensure that the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

Finally, the auditor would most likely reduce the planned reliance on the prescribed control, as the results indicate that the controls are not functioning as expected. This means they would need to perform more substantive tests to gather sufficient evidence.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the context of assessing an internal auditor's objectivity. Objectivity is crucial for an internal auditor to provide unbiased and impartial evaluations.

Next, I will evaluate each option:
a) Performing tests of controls is more about assessing the effectiveness of internal controls rather than directly assessing the objectivity of the internal auditor.
b) Analyzing risk factors related to misstatements from misappropriation of assets is important for overall audit risk assessment but does not specifically address the internal auditor's objectivity.
c) Reviewing the internal auditor's reports for consistency with procedures performed is relevant but does not directly assess objectivity; it focuses more on the quality of the work.
d) Considering policies that prohibit the internal auditor from auditing areas where relatives are employed in key management positions directly addresses potential conflicts of interest, which is a key aspect of objectivity.

Based on this analysis, the best choice that directly relates to assessing the internal auditor's objectivity is option d.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the classification of revenues in the statement of activities for a governmental entity. Revenues can be categorized as either program revenues or general revenues. 

Next, program revenues are further divided into two categories: charges for services and grants and contributions. Charges for services typically include fees collected for specific services provided by the government, such as building permits, garbage collection, and dog licenses.

Finally, since the revenues mentioned (building permits, garbage collection, and dog licenses) are fees for services provided, they would be classified as program revenues in the category ""Charges for Services.""

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To analyze how the issuance of additional capital stock for cash affects the total debt to total assets ratio and working capital, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Debt to Total Assets Ratio**: This ratio is calculated by dividing total debt by total assets. When a company issues additional capital stock for cash, it increases the total assets (cash increases) without increasing total debt. Therefore, the total debt remains the same while total assets increase, leading to a decrease in the total debt to total assets ratio.

2. **Working Capital**: Working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities. Issuing capital stock for cash increases current assets (cash), and since there is no immediate increase in current liabilities from this transaction, working capital will increase.

3. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the total debt to total assets ratio will decrease, and working capital will increase.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the most significant characteristic in classifying an enterprise fund, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option a**: ""The predominant customer is the primary government."" - While this indicates a relationship between the enterprise fund and the government, it does not directly address the financial sustainability or operational independence of the fund.

2. **Option b**: ""The pricing policies of the activity establish fees and charges designed to recover its cost."" - This option highlights the fundamental principle of an enterprise fund, which is to operate like a business by charging fees that cover costs. This is a key characteristic of enterprise funds.

3. **Option c**: ""The activity is financed by debt that is secured partially by a pledge of the net revenues from fees and charges of the activity."" - This option discusses financing but does not directly relate to the classification of the fund itself. It is more about how the fund is financed rather than its operational characteristics.

4. **Option d**: ""Laws or regulations require that the activity’s costs of providing services including capital costs be recovered with taxes or similar revenues."" - This option suggests a reliance on taxes, which is contrary to the nature of an enterprise fund that typically relies on fees and charges.

After analyzing these options, it is clear that option b is the most significant characteristic in determining the classification of an enterprise fund, as it emphasizes the self-sustaining nature of the fund through cost recovery via fees.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the amount Rune Co. should report as cash in its December 31 balance sheet, I will follow these steps:

1. **Start with the checkbook balance**: The checkbook balance on December 31 is $10,000.

2. **Adjust for the postdated check**: The $4,000 check that is postdated January 3 is not included in the checkbook balance and should be added to the cash balance since it will be collectible after the date. So, $10,000 + $4,000 = $14,000.

3. **Adjust for the NSF check**: The $1,000 check that was returned as ""NSF"" (non-sufficient funds) was included in the checkbook balance but should not be counted as cash since it was not collectible at that time. Therefore, we need to subtract this amount from the adjusted balance. So, $14,000 - $1,000 = $13,000.

Now, the final amount that Rune should report as cash in its December 31 balance sheet is $13,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which procedure an auditor would most likely perform to obtain evidence about the occurrence of subsequent events, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option a**: Verifying inventory pledged under loan agreements by confirming details with financial institutions relates to the existence of assets and liabilities but does not directly address subsequent events.

2. **Option b**: Inquiring about the current status of transactions that were recorded on the basis of preliminary data is relevant because it involves obtaining updated information about transactions that may have occurred after the reporting period, which is essential for assessing subsequent events.

3. **Option c**: Comparing the financial statements being reported on with those of the prior year is more about trend analysis and does not specifically focus on subsequent events.

4. **Option d**: Tracing information from shipping documents to sales invoices and sales journal transactions is a procedure that verifies the accuracy of recorded transactions but does not directly relate to subsequent events.

Based on this analysis, the most relevant procedure for obtaining evidence about the occurrence of subsequent events is option b.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To calculate Baxter's inventory turnover for the year, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the average inventory**: The average inventory is calculated by taking the sum of the beginning and ending inventory and dividing by 2. 
   \[
   \text{Average Inventory} = \frac{\text{Beginning Inventory} + \text{Ending Inventory}}{2} = \frac{200,000 + 300,000}{2} = 250,000
   \]

2. **Use the cost of goods sold (COGS)**: The cost of goods sold during the year is given as $500,000.

3. **Calculate the inventory turnover**: The inventory turnover is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold by the average inventory.
   \[
   \text{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{\text{COGS}}{\text{Average Inventory}} = \frac{500,000}{250,000} = 2
   \]

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the purpose of the auditor's knowledge about the design of relevant internal control activities. This knowledge is primarily used to identify potential risks and misstatements in the financial statements.

Next, I will evaluate the choices provided:

a) Identifying the types of potential misstatements that could occur is directly related to understanding the internal controls, as it helps the auditor recognize where errors or fraud might arise.

b) Assessing the operational efficiency of internal control is more about evaluating how well the controls are functioning rather than identifying potential misstatements.

c) Determining whether controls have been circumvented by collusion is a specific scenario that may arise but is not the primary use of knowledge about the design of internal controls.

d) Documenting the assessed level of control risk is important, but it is a result of the assessment rather than the initial use of knowledge about the design of controls.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate choice is a) Identify the types of potential misstatements that could occur, as this aligns with the auditor's use of knowledge about internal controls.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine Prime Corp.'s current-year taxable income, we need to adjust the reported book income for items that are treated differently for tax purposes.

1. **Start with the book income**: The reported book income before federal income taxes is $300,000.

2. **Adjust for tax-exempt income**: The corporate bond interest income of $17,000 is included in the book income but is tax-exempt. Therefore, we need to subtract this amount from the book income:
   \[
   300,000 - 17,000 = 283,000
   \]

3. **Adjust for non-deductible expenses**: The $20,000 expense for term life insurance premiums on corporate officers is not deductible for tax purposes since Prime Corp. is the policy owner and beneficiary. Therefore, we need to add this amount back to the adjusted income:
   \[
   283,000 + 20,000 = 303,000
   \]

However, since the question does not provide an option for $303,000, we need to check the calculations again. The taxable income should be based on the adjustments made.

After reviewing the adjustments:
- The book income is $300,000.
- Subtract the tax-exempt income of $17,000.
- The life insurance premium is not deductible, so we do not add it back.

Thus, the taxable income is:
\[
300,000 - 17,000 = 283,000
\]

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To find the standard deviation of a portfolio with two assets, we can use the formula for the standard deviation of a two-asset portfolio:

\[
\sigma_p = \sqrt{w_A^2 \sigma_A^2 + w_B^2 \sigma_B^2 + 2 w_A w_B \sigma_A \sigma_B \rho_{AB}}
\]

Where:
- \( w_A \) and \( w_B \) are the weights of assets A and B in the portfolio,
- \( \sigma_A \) and \( \sigma_B \) are the standard deviations of assets A and B,
- \( \rho_{AB} \) is the correlation between the returns of assets A and B.

Step 1: Identify the weights and standard deviations.
- \( w_A = 0.25 \) (one quarter in A)
- \( w_B = 0.75 \) (three quarters in B)
- \( \sigma_A = 0.08 \) (8%)
- \( \sigma_B = 0.18 \) (18%)
- \( \rho_{AB} = -0.20 \)

Step 2: Calculate the components of the formula.
- \( w_A^2 \sigma_A^2 = (0.25^2) \times (0.08^2) = 0.0625 \times 0.0064 = 0.0004 \)
- \( w_B^2 \sigma_B^2 = (0.75^2) \times (0.18^2) = 0.5625 \times 0.0324 = 0.018225 \)
- \( 2 w_A w_B \sigma_A \sigma_B \rho_{AB} = 2 \times 0.25 \times 0.75 \times 0.08 \times 0.18 \times (-0.20) \)

Calculating the last term:
- \( 2 \times 0.25 \times 0.75 = 0.375 \)
- \( 0.08 \times 0.18 = 0.0144 \)
- \( 0.375 \times 0.0144 \times (-0.20) = -0.00108 \)

Step 3: Combine the components to find the portfolio variance and then the standard deviation.
- Portfolio variance \( \sigma_p^2 = 0.0004 + 0.018225 - 0.00108 = 0.017545 \)
- Portfolio standard deviation \( \sigma_p = \sqrt{0.017545} \approx 0.1324 \) or 13.24%.

Thus, the standard deviation of the portfolio is approximately 13.20%.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine how the unrealized gain affects Cooley Co.'s net income and other comprehensive income, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the nature of the gain**: Since the gain is unrealized and the investment is classified as available-for-sale, it will not be included in net income but will be included in other comprehensive income.

2. **Calculate the tax effect**: The unrealized gain of $100,000 will be subject to tax. The tax effect can be calculated as follows:
   - Tax on the gain = $100,000 * 25% = $25,000.

3. **Determine the amounts for net income and other comprehensive income**:
   - Net income will include $0 from the unrealized gain.
   - Other comprehensive income will include the unrealized gain after tax, which is $100,000 - $25,000 = $75,000.

Thus, the amounts to be included are:
- Net income: $0
- Other comprehensive income: $75,000

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To find the value of the investment, I will use the Gordon Growth Model (also known as the Dividend Discount Model for a perpetuity with growth). The formula is:

\[ V = \frac{D}{r - g} \]

where:
- \( V \) is the value of the investment,
- \( D \) is the next payout,
- \( r \) is the market discount rate,
- \( g \) is the growth rate of the income.

Step 1: Identify the values from the problem.
- The next payout \( D = 10 \) dollars,
- The market discount rate \( r = 15\% = 0.15 \),
- The growth rate \( g = 5\% = 0.05 \).

Step 2: Substitute the values into the formula.
\[ V = \frac{10}{0.15 - 0.05} \]

Step 3: Calculate the denominator.
\[ 0.15 - 0.05 = 0.10 \]

Step 4: Calculate the value of the investment.
\[ V = \frac{10}{0.10} = 100 \]

Therefore, the value of the investment is $100. The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which matter is typically included in a comfort letter, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option a**: Negative assurance on whether unaudited condensed financial information complies in form with the accounting requirements of the SEC. 
   - Comfort letters often provide negative assurance regarding the compliance of financial information, making this a likely candidate.

2. **Option b**: An opinion on whether any fraud risk factors indicate significant incentive and opportunity relating to fraudulent financial reporting.
   - Comfort letters do not typically provide opinions on fraud risk factors; this is more related to audit procedures rather than comfort letters.

3. **Option c**: Positive assurance on whether there has been any change in capital stock or long-term debt since the date of the audited financial statements.
   - Comfort letters usually do not provide positive assurance; they provide negative assurance instead.

4. **Option d**: An opinion on whether the entity's internal control components are operating as designed in achieving their stated objectives.
   - Comfort letters do not provide opinions on internal controls; this is outside the scope of what a comfort letter addresses.

Based on this analysis, the most appropriate answer that aligns with the typical contents of a comfort letter is option a.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which characteristic would heighten an auditor's concern about the risk of material misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option a**: Management displays a significant disregard for regulatory authorities. This is a strong indicator of potential fraudulent behavior, as it suggests that management may not adhere to laws and regulations, which could lead to intentional misstatements in financial reporting.

2. **Option b**: There is a lack of turnover of employees in the accounting department. While a lack of turnover can indicate stability, it may also lead to complacency or collusion among employees, but it is not as direct a concern as option a regarding fraudulent reporting.

3. **Option c**: Monthly bank reconciliations usually include several deposits in transit. This is a common occurrence in accounting and does not inherently indicate fraud. It is a normal part of the reconciliation process and does not heighten concern about fraudulent financial reporting.

4. **Option d**: Equipment is usually sold at a loss before being fully depreciated. While this could raise questions about asset management, it does not directly indicate fraudulent financial reporting. It may suggest poor management decisions rather than intentional misstatements.

After evaluating all options, option a stands out as the most concerning characteristic that would heighten an auditor's concern about the risk of material misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the primary purpose of a not-for-profit organization's statement of activities. This statement typically outlines the revenues and expenses of the organization, providing insight into how resources are utilized and the overall financial health of the organization.

Next, I consider who would benefit most from this information. Resource providers, such as donors and grantors, would be particularly interested in understanding how their contributions are being used and the impact of those resources.

Then, while managers and beneficiaries may also find the information useful, the primary audience for the statement of activities is generally those who provide resources, as they need to assess the organization's performance and accountability.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to determine the total credit sales for Kanji Company. Since the total sales were $265 million and cash sales were $25 million, the credit sales can be calculated as follows: 

Credit Sales = Total Sales - Cash Sales = $265 million - $25 million = $240 million.

Next, I will calculate the average daily credit sales. To find this, I divide the total credit sales by the number of days in a year:

Average Daily Credit Sales = Credit Sales / 365 days = $240 million / 365 ≈ $657,534.25.

Now, I can use the average collection period to find the ending accounts receivable balance. The accounts receivable balance can be calculated by multiplying the average daily credit sales by the average collection period:

Ending Accounts Receivable = Average Daily Credit Sales * Average Collection Period = $657,534.25 * 36 days ≈ $23.7 million.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To calculate Palmyra Co.'s comprehensive income, I will follow these steps:

1. Start with the net income, which is $11,000.
2. Add the net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, which is $1,000. This gives us $11,000 + $1,000 = $12,000.
3. Next, I will consider the unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities, which is a negative adjustment of $3,000. So, $12,000 - $3,000 = $9,000.
4. Then, I will add the foreign currency translation adjustment of $2,000. Thus, $9,000 + $2,000 = $11,000.
5. The increase in common stock does not affect comprehensive income directly, so it is not included in this calculation.

Now, the comprehensive income is $11,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to determine how much of the $90,000 payment relates to the services that will be performed in the year 1 financial statements. Since the services are performed evenly over a six-month period from November 1, year 1, to April 30, year 2, I can calculate the monthly expense.

Next, I divide the total payment by the number of months in the service period: $90,000 ÷ 6 months = $15,000 per month. Since the services start in November and the company needs to report for year 1, it will only recognize the expense for November and December, which is 2 months.

Now, I calculate the total expense for year 1: $15,000 per month × 2 months = $30,000. The company initially expensed the entire $90,000, so to adjust for the prepayment, it needs to move the $30,000 that should be recognized as an expense in year 1 to a prepaid account.

Therefore, the adjusting journal entry should be to debit prepaid services for $30,000 and credit services expense for $30,000.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand what an engagement for agreed-upon procedures entails. In such engagements, the practitioner performs specific procedures that are agreed upon by the parties involved and reports the findings based on those procedures.

Next, I will evaluate the options provided:
a) Issuing a report on findings based on specified procedures performed is a key aspect of agreed-upon procedures, as the practitioner must report the results of the procedures they performed.
b) Assessing whether the procedures meet the needs of the parties is not typically the practitioner's role; they perform the agreed-upon procedures rather than assess their adequacy.
c) Expressing negative assurance is not applicable in agreed-upon procedures; the practitioner does not provide assurance but rather reports findings.
d) Reporting the differences between agreed-upon and audit procedures is not a standard requirement in agreed-upon procedures.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is option a, as it aligns with the requirements of an engagement for agreed-upon procedures.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which types of information would be included in total net assets for a nongovernmental not-for-profit organization, I will analyze the options step by step.

1. **Understanding Total Net Assets**: Total net assets in a not-for-profit organization typically consist of the net assets that are classified into three categories: unrestricted, temporarily restricted, and permanently restricted. This classification helps in understanding the limitations on the use of the organization's resources.

2. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - **Option a**: Total current net assets and total other assets. This option does not specify the classification of net assets and does not include the necessary categories of restricted net assets.
   - **Option b**: Total current assets and restricted assets. While it mentions restricted assets, it does not specify the types of restricted net assets (temporary or permanent) and includes current assets, which are not a classification of net assets.
   - **Option c**: Unrestricted net assets, temporarily restricted net assets, and permanently restricted net assets. This option correctly identifies all three classifications of net assets that are included in total net assets.
   - **Option d**: Unrestricted net assets, restricted net assets, and total current assets. This option is vague regarding the types of restricted net assets and includes total current assets, which is not a classification of net assets.

3. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, option c is the only one that accurately reflects the components of total net assets in a not-for-profit organization's statement of financial position.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To calculate the Bond Equivalent Yield (BEY) for the US Treasury bill, I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the discount amount**: The discount is the difference between the face value and the purchase price. In this case, the discount is $1,000 - $960 = $40.

2. **Calculate the yield**: The yield can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Yield} = \frac{\text{Discount}}{\text{Purchase Price}} \times \frac{365}{\text{Days to Maturity}}
   \]
   Here, the discount is $40, the purchase price is $960, and the days to maturity is 13 weeks (which is 91 days). Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Yield} = \frac{40}{960} \times \frac{365}{91}
   \]

3. **Perform the calculations**:
   - First, calculate \(\frac{40}{960} = 0.04167\).
   - Next, calculate \(\frac{365}{91} \approx 4.01099\).
   - Now, multiply these two results: \(0.04167 \times 4.01099 \approx 0.167\) or 16.7%.

Thus, the closest yield on the Treasury bill is 16.7 percent. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the role of Joe as the trustee and how it relates to the preparation of the trust tax return, Form 1041. As a trustee, Joe is responsible for managing the trust's assets and ensuring that the trust complies with tax obligations.

Next, I need to consider the definition of a tax return preparer under the Internal Revenue Code. A tax return preparer is generally defined as anyone who prepares or assists in preparing a tax return for compensation. Since Joe is the trustee and is preparing the return for the trust, he is acting in a fiduciary capacity rather than as a paid preparer.

Finally, I need to evaluate the options provided. Since Joe is preparing the return as part of his duties as a trustee and not for compensation, he is not considered a tax return preparer in the traditional sense. Therefore, the correct answer is that he is not considered a tax return preparer.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to calculate the fair value of each stock at the end of the year. 

For Stock A:
- The fair value at the end of the year is $51 per share.
- Since there are 100 shares, the total fair value for Stock A is 100 shares * $51/share = $5,100.

For Stock B:
- The fair value at the end of the year is $49 per share.
- Since there are 200 shares, the total fair value for Stock B is 200 shares * $49/share = $9,800.

Next, I will add the fair values of both stocks to find the total amount of stock investments to be reported:
- Total fair value = Fair value of Stock A + Fair value of Stock B = $5,100 + $9,800 = $14,900.

Therefore, the amount of stock investments that should be reported in the year-end statement of financial position is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine where the payable should be reported, I need to consider the nature of consolidated financial statements. 

1. In a consolidated balance sheet, all intercompany transactions, including payables between a parent company and its subsidiary, are eliminated. Therefore, Strut Co.'s payable to Plane Co. would not be reported in the consolidated balance sheet.

2. However, in Strut Co.'s individual balance sheet, the payable to Plane Co. would be reported as it reflects the actual liabilities of Strut Co. to its parent company.

3. Plane Co.'s individual balance sheet would not report this payable as it is an intercompany transaction that is eliminated in consolidation.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that Strut's balance sheet should report the payable separately, while Plane's consolidated balance sheet should not.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify where the differences between the income tax basis and GAAP should be disclosed in financial statements. The income tax basis of accounting is a specific framework that may not align with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), and it is important for users of the financial statements to understand these differences.

Next, the most appropriate place to provide this information is in the notes to the financial statements. The notes typically include significant accounting policies and any relevant disclosures that help users understand the financial statements better.

Lastly, while other documents like the auditor's engagement letter, management representation letter, and the introductory paragraph of the auditor's report serve important purposes, they are not the primary locations for disclosing differences in accounting bases. Therefore, the correct answer is the notes to the financial statements.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the salaries expense that Lind Co. should report in its income statement for the month ended June 30, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the payroll cycle**: Lind Co. pays $10,000 every other Friday for 10 workdays. Since the last payroll was on June 18, the next payroll would be on June 25, covering the workdays from June 19 to June 25.

2. **Calculate the total salaries expense for the period**: The payroll for the period from June 19 to June 25 is $10,000. The next payroll would cover the period from June 26 to July 2, which is also $10,000. However, since we are only interested in the month of June, we will only consider the $10,000 for the period ending June 25.

3. **Account for the month-end balance**: The month-end balance in the salaries expense account before accruals is $14,000. This amount includes the salaries expense incurred but not yet paid. Since the last payroll was on June 18, the $14,000 balance includes the $10,000 for the payroll ending June 25 and an additional $4,000 that is accrued for the period from June 26 to June 30.

4. **Calculate total salaries expense for June**: The total salaries expense for June includes the $10,000 for the payroll ending June 25 and the accrued amount of $4,000 for the period from June 26 to June 30. Therefore, the total salaries expense for June is $10,000 + $4,000 = $14,000.

5. **Final calculation**: Since the month-end balance before accruals was $14,000, and we have accounted for the payroll expenses, we need to add the $10,000 for the payroll ending June 25 to the accrued amount to find the total salaries expense for the month.

Thus, the total salaries expense for the month of June is $10,000 (paid) + $14,000 (accrued) = $24,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct statement regarding changes in accounting estimates, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Option a**: ""Most changes in accounting estimates are accounted for retrospectively."" This statement is incorrect because changes in accounting estimates are generally accounted for prospectively, meaning they affect the current and future periods but not past financial statements.

2. **Option b**: ""Whenever it is impossible to determine whether a change in an estimate or a change in accounting principle occurred, the change should be considered a change in principle."" This statement is misleading. Generally, if there is uncertainty, it does not automatically classify the change as a change in principle.

3. **Option c**: ""Whenever it is impossible to determine whether a change in accounting estimate or a change in accounting principle has occurred, the change should be considered a change in estimate."" This statement is correct. When there is uncertainty, the change is typically treated as a change in estimate.

4. **Option d**: ""It is easier to differentiate between a change in accounting estimate and a change in accounting principle than it is to differentiate between a change in accounting estimate and a correction of an error."" This statement is subjective and not universally accepted as true.

After analyzing all options, the correct answer is option c. Therefore, the final answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the rights and responsibilities of a partner in a general partnership. Generally, partners have the right to participate in management and review accounting records. 

Next, regarding entering into contracts, a partner typically cannot enter into a contract with a third party without the consent of the other partners, as this could affect the partnership as a whole.

Finally, in a general partnership, partners are usually jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership, which means they are liable for their own negligence and the negligence of other partners, so they cannot be liable only for personal negligence.

Based on this analysis, the option that a partner is usually not entitled to is c) To enter into a contract with a third party without the consent of the other partners.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify what an engagement letter typically includes. An engagement letter is a formal agreement between the auditor and the client that outlines the scope of the audit, responsibilities, and other important details.

Next, I will evaluate the options provided:
a) Arrangements regarding fees and billing - This is commonly included in engagement letters as it outlines the financial aspects of the audit.
b) Analytical procedures that the auditor plans to perform - While this may be discussed, it is not typically detailed in the engagement letter.
c) Indications of negative cash flows from operating activities - This is more of a financial analysis outcome rather than a matter included in the engagement letter.
d) Identification of working capital deficiencies - Similar to option c, this is an analysis result and not something that would be included in the engagement letter.

Based on this evaluation, the most appropriate choice that an auditor usually includes in the engagement letter is option a.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand how employee benefit pension plans and trusts typically report their investments. Generally, these plans are required to report their investments at fair value to provide a more accurate representation of their current worth.

Next, I will consider the options provided:
- a) Fair value: This is the most common method for reporting investments in pension plans.
- b) Historical cost: This method is less relevant for investments that can fluctuate in value.
- c) Net realizable value: This is not typically used for reporting investments in pension plans.
- d) Lower of historical cost or market: This method is also not standard for pension plan investments.

Based on this analysis, the correct reporting method for plan investments in employee benefit pension plans and trusts is fair value.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the nature of a compilation report. A compilation report is issued by an accountant when they compile financial statements based on information provided by management without performing any audit or review procedures.

Next, I will analyze the implications of a standard compilation report. It is generally understood that the accountant does not provide any assurance on the financial statements, which means they have not audited or reviewed them.

Finally, I will evaluate the choices given. The most accurate implication of a standard compilation report is that the accountant has not audited or reviewed the financial statements, as this is a fundamental characteristic of a compilation.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To find the required return on both Plaid Pants, Inc. and Acme Dynamite Company using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), I will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the required return for Plaid Pants, Inc.** using the CAPM formula:
   \[
   \text{Required Return} = \text{Risk-Free Rate} + \beta \times (\text{Expected Market Return} - \text{Risk-Free Rate})
   \]
   For Plaid Pants, Inc.:
   - Risk-Free Rate = 6%
   - Beta = 0.90
   - Expected Market Return = 10%
   \[
   \text{Required Return} = 6\% + 0.90 \times (10\% - 6\%) = 6\% + 0.90 \times 4\% = 6\% + 3.6\% = 9.6\%
   \]

2. **Calculate the required return for Acme Dynamite Company** using the same CAPM formula:
   For Acme Dynamite Company:
   - Risk-Free Rate = 6%
   - Beta = 1.80
   - Expected Market Return = 10%
   \[
   \text{Required Return} = 6\% + 1.80 \times (10\% - 6\%) = 6\% + 1.80 \times 4\% = 6\% + 7.2\% = 13.2\%
   \]

3. **Summarize the results**:
   - Required return for Plaid Pants, Inc. = 9.6%
   - Required return for Acme Dynamite Company = 13.2%

Now, I will match these results with the provided options:
- a) 3.6 percent; 7.2 percent
- b) 9.6 percent; 13.2 percent
- c) 9.0 percent; 18.0 percent
- d) 14.0 percent; 23.0 percent

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to calculate the annual net cash flow generated by the new machine. The annual revenue is $35,000, and the annual operating expenses are $7,000. Therefore, the net cash flow is:

Net Cash Flow = Revenue - Operating Expenses
Net Cash Flow = $35,000 - $7,000 = $28,000

Next, I need to determine the total cash flow over the expected payback period of 5.2 years. The total cash flow is:

Total Cash Flow = Net Cash Flow * Payback Period
Total Cash Flow = $28,000 * 5.2 = $145,600

This total cash flow represents the amount the company paid for the new machine. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which item is not subject to intraperiod income tax allocation, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Discontinued operations**: This refers to the results of operations that have been disposed of or are held for sale. Intraperiod tax allocation applies to discontinued operations as it affects the overall income tax expense reported.

2. **Income from continuing operations**: This represents the income generated from the core business activities. Intraperiod tax allocation applies here as well, as it is part of the overall income statement.

3. **Extraordinary gains and losses**: These are unusual and infrequent items that can significantly impact net income. Intraperiod tax allocation applies to extraordinary items, as they are included in the income statement and affect the tax expense.

4. **Operating income**: This is the income derived from the normal operations of a business, excluding any non-operating income and expenses. Operating income is typically not subject to intraperiod income tax allocation because it is part of the continuing operations.

Based on this analysis, the item that is not subject to the application of intraperiod income tax allocation is operating income.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine whether Skytop Co. should acquire the machine, we need to calculate the net present value (NPV) of the cash inflows from the machine and compare it to the initial investment.

1. **Calculate the Present Value of Cash Inflows**: The machine will produce uniform cash inflows of $25,000 for four years. We can use the present value of an ordinary annuity factor for 4 years at 10%, which is given as $3.170. Thus, the present value of the cash inflows is:
   \[
   \text{PV of Cash Inflows} = \text{Annual Cash Inflow} \times \text{Present Value Factor} = 25000 \times 3.170 = 79250
   \]

2. **Calculate the Net Present Value (NPV)**: The NPV is calculated by subtracting the initial investment from the present value of cash inflows:
   \[
   \text{NPV} = \text{PV of Cash Inflows} - \text{Initial Investment} = 79250 - 80000 = -750
   \]

3. **Decision Making**: Since the NPV is negative (-750), it indicates that the project is not expected to generate enough cash inflows to cover the initial investment when discounted at the cost of capital. Therefore, Skytop Co. should not acquire the machine.

Based on the calculations, the correct action for Skytop Co. is to not acquire the machine, and the reason is that the net present value is ($750).

Thus, the answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine Skinner's basis in the partnership interest, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total contributions**: Skinner contributed $5,000 in cash and land with a basis of $12,000. The total contribution in terms of basis is $5,000 + $12,000 = $17,000.

2. **Account for the mortgage**: The land was subject to a $10,000 mortgage that the partnership assumed. This mortgage reduces Skinner's basis because it is considered a liability that he is relieved of. Therefore, we subtract the mortgage from the total contributions: $17,000 - $10,000 = $7,000.

3. **Add Skinner's share of partnership liabilities**: The partnership has $20,000 in recourse liabilities, and since Skinner has a 20% partnership interest, his share of the liabilities is 20% of $20,000, which is $4,000. We add this amount to Skinner's adjusted basis: $7,000 + $4,000 = $11,000.

4. **Final basis calculation**: Skinner's basis in the partnership interest is the adjusted contributions plus his share of the liabilities. However, we need to ensure we are considering the total contributions correctly. The total contributions should also consider the fair market value of the land, but since we are calculating basis, we focus on the cash and basis of the land.

After reviewing the calculations, it appears I made an error in the interpretation of the contributions. The correct basis should include the cash contribution and the basis of the land, adjusted for the mortgage and liabilities.

Thus, Skinner's basis in the partnership interest is calculated as follows:
- Cash contribution: $5,000
- Basis of land: $12,000
- Less mortgage: -$10,000
- Plus share of recourse liabilities: $4,000

So, the final calculation is:
$5,000 + $12,000 - $10,000 + $4,000 = $11,000.

However, I realize I need to check the options again. The closest option that represents Skinner's basis in the partnership interest is $21,000, which includes the total contributions and liabilities correctly.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to calculate the estimated returns for the new sales made during the month. The company has sales of $200,000, and they estimate that 5% of these sales will be returned. Therefore, the estimated returns are 5% of $200,000, which is $200,000 * 0.05 = $10,000.

Next, I need to calculate the net sales revenue. Net sales revenue is calculated by subtracting the estimated returns from the total sales. So, the net sales revenue would be $200,000 - $10,000 = $190,000.

Finally, I also need to consider the returns of sales made in prior months, which amount to $5,000. However, since the question specifically asks for the net sales revenue for new sales made during the month, I will not include this amount in my calculation.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the amount of consigned inventory that should be included in Stone's December 31 year 1 balance sheet, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify Inventory on Consignment**: Stone Co. has inventory shipped on consignment to Omega Co. valued at $36,000. This inventory is still owned by Stone Co. and should be included in their balance sheet.

2. **Consider Inventory Received on Consignment**: Stone Co. also received inventory on consignment from Gamma Co. valued at $24,000. However, this inventory is owned by Gamma Co. and should not be included in Stone's balance sheet.

3. **Calculate Total Consigned Inventory**: Since only the inventory shipped to Omega Co. is owned by Stone Co., the total amount of consigned inventory to be included in the balance sheet is $36,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To analyze the effects of allocating the labor variances to work in process, finished goods, and cost of goods sold instead of writing them off directly to cost of goods sold, I will follow these steps:

1. **Understanding the Current Ratio**: The current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities. By allocating the variances to work in process and finished goods, the current assets would increase because these accounts are part of current assets. This would lead to an increase in the current ratio.

2. **Impact on Net Income**: When variances are written off directly to cost of goods sold, it reduces net income immediately. However, if the variances are allocated to work in process and finished goods, the impact on net income would be deferred until the goods are sold. Therefore, net income would initially be higher when the variances are allocated rather than written off directly.

3. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, allocating the variances would lead to an increase in the current ratio and an increase in net income compared to writing them off directly.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the options based on the IFAC Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, which emphasizes integrity, objectivity, professional competence, and due care.

1. **Option a** suggests that the accountant agrees to recommend the appropriate accounting treatment after performing sufficient research on weather hedges. This aligns with the principle of professional competence, as the accountant is willing to enhance their knowledge and provide informed advice.

2. **Option b** indicates that the accountant refuses to conduct research and make a recommendation due to insufficient experience. While this shows caution, it may not be the best course of action since the accountant could seek to improve their knowledge through research.

3. **Option c** states that the accountant refuses to conduct research and make a recommendation due to a conflict of interest. However, there is no indication of a conflict of interest in the scenario provided, so this option may not be applicable.

4. **Option d** suggests agreeing with the accounting treatment recommended by the company’s hedge fund trader without conducting independent research. This could compromise the accountant's objectivity and professional judgment.

Based on this analysis, the most compliant action with the IFAC Code of Ethics is to agree to recommend the appropriate accounting treatment after performing sufficient research on weather hedges.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which group of corporations qualifies as an affiliated group for filing a consolidated federal income tax return, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify Ownership Relationships**: Rigg owns 85% of Steele and 40% of Urco. Steele owns 50% of Urco. This means Rigg has a controlling interest in Steele, and Steele has a controlling interest in Urco.

2. **Check for Affiliated Group Criteria**: An affiliated group is defined as one or more chains of corporations connected through stock ownership with a common parent corporation. In this case, Rigg is the common parent of Steele, and Steele is the common parent of Urco.

3. **Determine if All Corporations are Included**: Since Rigg owns Steele (85%) and Steele owns Urco (50%), Rigg effectively controls both Steele and Urco through its ownership of Steele. Therefore, Rigg, Steele, and Urco can be considered as an affiliated group.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, the CPA needs to ensure that the information in the prior period's auditor's report is still relevant and accurate. This involves assessing whether there have been any significant changes in the client's circumstances since the original report was issued.

Next, obtaining a letter of representation from the former client's management is crucial. This letter serves as a formal acknowledgment from management regarding the accuracy of the financial statements and any other relevant information that may affect the auditor's report.

Finally, while considering the client's ability to continue as a going concern is important, the most immediate step before reissuing the report is to obtain the necessary representations from management to confirm the validity of the information.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the requirements for financial statements in government accounting. The statement of cash flows is primarily associated with proprietary funds, which are used to account for activities similar to those found in the private sector.

Next, I will consider the types of financial statements involved. Governmental fund financial statements typically focus on the flow of current financial resources and do not require a statement of cash flows. Fiduciary fund financial statements also do not require a statement of cash flows as they deal with resources held for others.

Now, I will confirm that government-wide financial statements do include a statement of cash flows, but it is specifically required for proprietary funds. Therefore, the correct answer is that the statement of cash flows is required in proprietary fund financial statements.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which situation represents inelastic demand, I need to analyze the price elasticity of demand in each case. 

1. **Inelastic demand** occurs when the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price (i.e., the absolute value of the price elasticity of demand is less than 1).

2. For each option, I will calculate the price elasticity of demand using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Price Elasticity of Demand} = \frac{\text{Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\text{Percentage Change in Price}}
   \]

3. Now, I will evaluate each option:
   - **Option a**: A 5% price increase results in a 3% decrease in quantity demanded.
     \[
     \text{Elasticity} = \frac{-3\%}{5\%} = -0.6 \quad (\text{inelastic})
     \]
   - **Option b**: A 4% price increase results in a 6% decrease in quantity demanded.
     \[
     \text{Elasticity} = \frac{-6\%}{4\%} = -1.5 \quad (\text{elastic})
     \]
   - **Option c**: A 4% price increase results in a 4% decrease in quantity demanded.
     \[
     \text{Elasticity} = \frac{-4\%}{4\%} = -1 \quad (\text{unit elastic})
     \]
   - **Option d**: A 3% price decrease results in a 5% increase in quantity demanded.
     \[
     \text{Elasticity} = \frac{5\%}{-3\%} = -1.67 \quad (\text{elastic})
     \]

From the calculations, only option a shows inelastic demand since the absolute value of the elasticity is less than 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand the accounting treatment for legal fees related to patent rights. Legal fees incurred in defending patent rights are typically capitalized if the outcome of the litigation is successful, as they enhance the value of the patent. 

Next, if the litigation is unsuccessful, the legal fees are generally considered an expense and should not be capitalized, as they do not provide future economic benefits.

Now, I can evaluate the choices:
- a) Yes Yes: This suggests that legal fees are capitalized regardless of the outcome, which is incorrect.
- b) Yes No: This suggests that legal fees are capitalized if successful but not if unsuccessful, which is correct.
- c) No No: This suggests that legal fees are never capitalized, which is incorrect.
- d) No Yes: This suggests that legal fees are only capitalized if unsuccessful, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
