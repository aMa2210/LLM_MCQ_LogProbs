"First, I need to understand the definitions of the terms provided in the choices. 

1. **Bargaining** refers to the negotiation process where parties discuss terms to reach an agreement, but it doesn't specifically imply an outcome.
2. **Satisficing** is a decision-making strategy that aims for a satisfactory or adequate result, rather than the optimal one. This aligns with the idea of a sub-optimal but acceptable outcome.
3. **Accepting** generally means agreeing to something, but it doesn't specifically refer to the negotiation context.
4. **Compromising** involves each party making concessions to reach an agreement, which can also lead to a sub-optimal outcome, but it emphasizes the process of give-and-take.

Given these definitions, the term that best describes a sub-optimal but acceptable outcome of negotiations is ""satisficing."" 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

"To determine the correct answer, I will analyze the meaning of a normative perspective. 

First, a normative perspective typically involves judgments about what is desirable or what ought to be, rather than simply describing the current state of affairs. 

Second, it contrasts with descriptive perspectives, which focus on how things are without making value judgments. 

Finally, since a normative perspective is concerned with ideals and standards, it aligns with the notion of ""the way things should be.""

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify what the 'five forces model' refers to. It is a framework for analyzing the competitive environment of an industry, developed by Michael Porter. The model includes five forces that shape competition.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the correct assumption of the garbage can model of decision making, I will analyze the options step by step.

First, the garbage can model suggests that decision-making in organizations is often chaotic and not linear. It emphasizes the randomness and the presence of multiple problems, solutions, and participants.

Second, the model operates under the premise that decision-makers often have limited knowledge about the problems and solutions available to them. This reflects a lack of complete information, which leads to uncertainty in the decision-making process.

Third, the model also highlights that decisions are made in an environment where there is a high degree of uncertainty, as the outcomes of decisions are not always predictable due to the complexity of the situation.

Based on this analysis, the most fitting assumption of the garbage can model is that it is based on limited knowledge and uncertainty.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the principle by which utilitarianism is defined, I will analyze the options step by step.

First, I need to understand the core idea of utilitarianism, which is a moral theory that suggests that the best action is the one that maximizes utility, typically defined as that which produces the greatest well-being of the greatest number of people.

Next, I will evaluate the options:
- Option a) ""Equality for everyone"" does not capture the essence of utilitarianism, as it focuses more on equal treatment rather than maximizing overall happiness.
- Option b) ""Maximisation of outcomes for individuals"" is somewhat close, but it does not emphasize the collective aspect of the greatest number, which is central to utilitarianism.
- Option c) ""The best outcome for the majority of people"" aligns well with the utilitarian principle of maximizing overall happiness for the greatest number.
- Option d) ""The least worst outcome for everybody"" suggests a focus on minimizing harm rather than maximizing happiness, which is not the primary focus of utilitarianism.

Based on this analysis, the option that best defines utilitarianism is c) ""The best outcome for the majority of people.""

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the definitions of the provided options. 

a) Group roles refer to the specific behaviors and tasks that individuals are expected to perform within a group setting. This aligns with the description given in the question.

b) Virtual teamwork refers to collaboration among team members who are not physically present in the same location, which does not directly relate to the expected behaviors of group members.

c) Synergy refers to the combined effect that is greater than the sum of individual efforts, which is more about the outcome of collaboration rather than the expected behaviors of group members.

d) Role making involves the process of individuals negotiating and defining their roles within a group, which is different from the established expectations of behaviors and tasks.

Based on this analysis, the term that best fits the description in the question is ""Group roles."" 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to identify the term that relates to the assessment and demonstration of an organization's social, economic, and environmental impacts.

"To determine which type of organizational culture is most likely to deliver stability and efficiency, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Task Culture**: This culture focuses on getting tasks done and is often project-based. While it can be efficient, it may not provide the stability needed for long-term operations.

2. **Role Culture**: This culture is characterized by a clear hierarchy and defined roles and responsibilities. It emphasizes rules and procedures, which can lead to stability and efficiency in operations.

3. **Power Culture**: This culture is centered around a central figure or a small group of individuals who hold power. It can be efficient in decision-making but may lack stability due to its reliance on a few key individuals.

4. **People Culture**: This culture values individuals and their contributions, focusing on teamwork and collaboration. While it can foster a positive environment, it may not prioritize efficiency and stability as much as other cultures.

Based on this analysis, the **Role Culture** is most likely to deliver stability and efficiency due to its structured approach and clear roles.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify which of the given options is most closely associated with contingency theory of leadership. 

1. Fred Fiedler is well-known for his work on contingency theory, particularly with his Contingency Model of Leadership, which suggests that the effectiveness of a leader is contingent upon the match between the leader's style and the specific situational variables.

2. Rosabeth Kanter is known for her work in organizational behavior and change, but she is not primarily associated with contingency theory.

3. Joan Woodward is recognized for her research on organizational structure and technology, not specifically on leadership theories.

4. Rensis Likert is known for his work on management systems and organizational behavior, but he is not a leading figure in contingency theory.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze the advantages typically associated with a hierarchical structure. 

1. A clear chain of command (a) is indeed an advantage, as it establishes authority and responsibility within the organization.
2. Discipline and stability (c) are also advantages, as hierarchical structures often promote order and consistency in operations.
3. A small span of control (d) can be an advantage as it allows managers to closely supervise their subordinates.

Next, I need to evaluate the option that does not align with the advantages of a hierarchical structure. 

4. Quick response to change (b) is generally not an advantage of a hierarchical structure. This type of structure can often lead to slower decision-making processes due to the multiple layers of management that need to be consulted.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the definition of a strategic alliance. A strategic alliance typically involves a formal agreement between two or more firms to collaborate and share resources for mutual benefit, often to produce products or services.

Next, I will analyze the choices provided:
- Choice a) suggests any form of partnership, which is too broad and does not capture the formal aspect of a strategic alliance.
- Choice b) specifies a formal agreement to exchange resources to produce products or services, which aligns well with the definition of a strategic alliance.
- Choice c) focuses on sharing profits from a shared investment, which is more specific and does not encompass the broader concept of resource exchange.

- Option b) includes ""actionable"" and ""resourced,"" which are not part of the traditional SMART criteria.
- Option c) uses ""standardised"" and ""rewarded,"" which do not fit the SMART framework.
- Option d) has ""rewarded"" instead of ""relevant,"" which is incorrect.

After reviewing all options, none of them perfectly match the traditional definition of SMART. However, the closest option that includes ""Specific,"" ""Measurable,"" and ""Achievable"" is option d), despite the incorrect use of ""rewarded.""

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to identify the key characteristics of bureaucracies and the writers associated with them. Max Weber is known for his work on bureaucracy and its characteristics, such as hierarchy, rules, and impersonal relationships. 

Next, I consider the other options. Robert K. Merton studied the effects of bureaucracy on individuals and organizations, but he did not focus specifically on workers' reactions. Alvin Gouldner examined the relationship between workers and bureaucratic structures, particularly in terms of their responses to bureaucratic norms. Elton Mayo is known for the Hawthorne studies, which focused on worker productivity and social relations rather than bureaucratic characteristics.

Finally, since the question specifically asks about the reaction of workers to bureaucracies, Alvin Gouldner's work is most relevant. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the optimal span of control, I need to consider the factors that influence it. 

First, the span of control refers to the number of subordinates that a manager or supervisor can effectively manage. A narrower span allows for more direct supervision and support, while a wider span can lead to more autonomy for employees.

Second, research and management theories suggest that an optimal span of control typically ranges from 5 to 7 subordinates. This range allows managers to maintain effective communication and oversight without becoming overwhelmed.

Finally, while some organizations may function well with a span of control of 2 or even higher than 7, the most commonly accepted optimal range in management literature is between 5 and 7.

Given these considerations, the best answer is c) 7, as it falls within the commonly accepted range for effective management.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand the different types of authority typically recognized in organizational structures. 

1. **Executive authority** refers to the power held by individuals in executive positions to make decisions and enforce policies within an organization.
2. **Functional authority** is the power given to individuals to control specific functions or departments, regardless of the hierarchical structure.
3. **Line management authority** pertains to the direct control and supervision of employees and operations within a specific line of command.

Now, I need to evaluate the last option, **Supplier authority**. Suppliers typically do not hold authority within an organization; they provide goods or services but do not have decision-making power over the organization's internal operations.

Based on this analysis, the option that is not a recognized type of authority is **Supplier**.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze the characteristics of a team. A team typically involves collaboration and shared goals, which means that knowledge sharing is usually encouraged rather than minimal.

"To determine what intuitive decision making is based on, I will analyze the options provided:

1. **Guesswork**: This implies making decisions without any basis or reasoning, which does not align with the concept of intuition that often involves some underlying knowledge or experience.

2. **Gambling**: This suggests a reliance on chance rather than any form of intuition or decision-making process, which is not representative of intuitive decision making.

3. **Instinct**: This option aligns closely with intuitive decision making, as it refers to the ability to make decisions based on gut feelings or inherent understanding without extensive reasoning.

4. **Rationality**: This involves logical reasoning and analysis, which contrasts with the nature of intuitive decision making that often bypasses detailed analysis.

Based on this analysis, intuitive decision making is primarily based on instinct. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the theoretical perspectives of work design mentioned in the options. 

1. The Job Characteristics Model (JCM) specifically focuses on how certain job characteristics can enhance job satisfaction and productivity. It emphasizes the importance of five core job dimensions: skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback.

2. The Process Improvement approach generally focuses on optimizing workflows and processes rather than directly addressing job satisfaction and productivity through job design.

3. The Techno-structural Change Model involves changes in technology and organizational structure, which may indirectly affect job satisfaction but is not primarily focused on it.

4. Socio-technical systems theory looks at the interrelationship between social and technical aspects of an organization, which can influence job satisfaction but is broader in scope than just job design.

Given this analysis, the theoretical perspective that directly emphasizes the enhancement of job satisfaction and productivity through job design is the Job Characteristics Model.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

Based on this analysis, the characteristic most commonly associated with the 'rational goal' model of management is productivity.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the typical sequence of managerial functions. The first function is usually planning, where managers set objectives and determine a course of action. 

Next, after planning, managers typically move to organising, which involves arranging resources and tasks to implement the plan effectively.

Following organising, the next function is leading, where managers motivate and direct their teams to achieve the objectives set during the planning phase.

Finally, controlling is the last function, where managers monitor progress and make adjustments as necessary to ensure that the goals are met.

Based on this sequence, the correct order of managerial functions is planning, organising, leading, and controlling. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

"To determine which option is not a component of an agile organization, I will analyze each choice step by step.

1. **Market focus and position**: Agile organizations are typically very responsive to market changes and customer needs, making market focus a crucial component. Therefore, this is likely a component of an agile organization.

2. **Human resources: multi-skilling**: Agile organizations often emphasize the importance of multi-skilled teams that can adapt to various roles and tasks. This flexibility is essential for agility, so this is also a component of an agile organization.

3. **Organisational structure**: Agile organizations tend to have a flatter organizational structure that promotes collaboration and quick decision-making. This structure is fundamental to agility, making it a component of an agile organization.

4. **Project-based culture**: While agile methodologies often involve project-based work, a project-based culture is not necessarily a defining characteristic of an agile organization. Agile can be applied in various contexts, not limited to project-based environments.

Based on this analysis, the option that is not a component of an agile organization is likely to be the project-based culture.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the concept of worker autonomy in decision making. Worker autonomy refers to the ability of employees to make decisions regarding their work without excessive oversight or control from management.

a) Worker freedom - This suggests a lack of restrictions, which aligns with autonomy.
b) Greater worker negotiation - This implies discussions and bargaining, which is not directly about autonomy.
c) Worker empowerment - This indicates giving workers the authority and confidence to make decisions, closely related to autonomy.
d) Increased worker power - This suggests a broader influence or control, which may not specifically relate to decision-making autonomy.

Now, considering the definitions, ""worker empowerment"" (c) is the most direct example of worker autonomy in decision making, as it emphasizes the ability and authority given to workers to make their own decisions.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand what vertical integration forwards means. Vertical integration forwards refers to a company expanding its operations into the next stage of the supply chain, which typically means moving closer to the end consumer.

Next, I can analyze the options provided:
a) Towards the source of supply - This describes backward integration, not forward.
b) Towards the consumer - This aligns with the definition of forward integration, as it involves moving closer to the end user.
c) At the same stage of the supply chain - This describes horizontal integration, not vertical.
d) In another industry - This does not specifically relate to vertical integration.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is option b, as it accurately describes forward vertical integration.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the definitions of the terms provided in the choices. 

a) A subsidiary is a company that is completely or partially owned by another company, known as the parent company. 
b) A strategic partnership is a formal alliance between two or more parties to pursue a set of agreed-upon objectives while remaining independent organizations. 
c) A strategic alliance is similar to a partnership but often involves a broader range of collaborative efforts between companies. 
d) A strategic business unit (SBU) is a semi-autonomous unit within a larger corporation that focuses on a specific market or product line, allowing it to operate independently while still being part of the overall corporate structure.

Next, I need to identify which term best fits the description of an autonomous business entity within a corporate enterprise that is distinct from other areas of the business. 

The term ""strategic business unit"" (SBU) specifically refers to a unit that operates independently within a larger organization, focusing on its own market and objectives, which aligns perfectly with the description given.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which option is not a characteristic of a corporate social responsibility (CSR) framework, I will analyze each choice:

1. **Retaining the status quo**: This implies maintaining existing conditions without change. CSR frameworks typically aim to improve social and environmental conditions, so this does not align with the proactive nature of CSR.

2. **Understanding society**: A key aspect of CSR is understanding the societal context in which a corporation operates, including the needs and expectations of stakeholders.

3. **Harnessing diversity**: CSR frameworks often emphasize the importance of diversity and inclusion, recognizing that diverse perspectives can enhance decision-making and social impact.

4. **Building capacity**: This involves developing skills and resources within communities or organizations, which is a common goal of CSR initiatives to foster sustainable development.

Based on this analysis, the option that does not align with the characteristics of a CSR framework is ""Retaining the status quo.""

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

It aims to enhance participants' awareness of their own behavior and how it affects others, fostering transformational change in attitudes and behaviors.

Next, I can analyze the choices provided:
a) A group whose aim is transformational change - This aligns well with the purpose of T-group training, which is to facilitate personal and group transformation.
b) A group brought together to deliver training programmes - This does not accurately describe T-group training, as it is more about personal development than delivering training.
c) Team training for the purposes of advancing technology - This is not relevant to T-group training, which is not focused on technology.
d) Team building activities involving learning - While T-group training does involve learning, it is more focused on personal and interpersonal growth rather than just team building.

Based on this analysis, the best choice that describes T-group training is option a.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to understand what a social enterprise is. A social enterprise is an organization that applies commercial strategies to maximize improvements in human and environmental well-being, rather than maximizing profits for shareholders.

Next, I can analyze the options provided. 
- Option a) Profit maximisation is typically associated with traditional businesses, not social enterprises.
- Option b) Maximising market share is also a goal of traditional businesses, not the primary focus of social enterprises.
- Option c) Providing public service can be a part of a social enterprise's mission, but it does not fully capture the essence of running a business for social benefits.
- Option d) Running a business to create social benefits aligns perfectly with the definition of a social enterprise, as it emphasizes the dual goal of achieving social impact while being financially sustainable.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
