answer
"To find the degree of the field extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{18}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Simplify the field extension**: Notice that \( \sqrt{18} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 2} = 3\sqrt{2} \). Therefore, \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{18}) = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \).

2. **Determine the degrees of the extensions**: 
   - The extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) has degree 2, since \( \sqrt{2} \) is not in \( \mathbb{Q} \) and the minimal polynomial is \( x^2 - 2 \).
   - Next, consider \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \). The element \( \sqrt{3} \) is not in \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \) because \( \sqrt{3} \) cannot be expressed as a rational combination of \( 1 \) and \( \sqrt{2} \). Thus, the degree of the extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \) is also 2.

3. **Calculate the total degree**: The total degree of the extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is the product of the degrees of the individual extensions:
   \[
   [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) : \mathbb{Q}] = [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) : \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})] \cdot [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) : \mathbb{Q}] = 2 \cdot 2 = 4.
   \]

Thus, the degree of the field extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{18}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To find the index of the subgroup generated by the permutation \( p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) \) in \( S_5 \), we first need to determine the order of the permutation \( p \).

1. **Determine the cycle structure of \( p \)**: 
   - The permutation \( (1, 2, 5, 4) \) is a 4-cycle, which has an order of 4.
   - The permutation \( (2, 3) \) is a 2-cycle, which has an order of 2.
   - Since these two cycles are disjoint, the order of the product \( p \) is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of the individual cycles. Therefore, the order of \( p \) is \( \text{lcm}(4, 2) = 4 \).

2. **Calculate the order of \( S_5 \)**: 
   - The symmetric group \( S_5 \) has \( 5! = 120 \) elements.

3. **Find the index of \( \langle p \rangle \) in \( S_5 \)**: 
   - The index of a subgroup \( H \) in a group \( G \) is given by the formula \( |G| / |H| \), where \( |H| \) is the order of the subgroup generated by \( p \).
   - The order of the subgroup \( \langle p \rangle \) is equal to the order of \( p \), which we found to be 4.
   - Therefore, the index is \( |S_5| / |\langle p \rangle| = 120 / 4 = 30 \).

Since 30 is not one of the provided options, I will double-check the calculations. 

However, the index of a subgroup in a group is typically calculated as \( |G| / |H| \), and since we have confirmed the order of \( S_5 \) and the order of \( \langle p \rangle \), the index should indeed be 30.

Given the options provided, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or miscalculation in the options themselves. 

Thus, the answer is not present in the options provided. However, based on the calculations, the index of \( \langle p \rangle \) in \( S_5 \) is 30. 

Since the options do not include 30, I will conclude with the closest logical option based on the calculations, which is not directly applicable here. 

Therefore, the answer is not available in the options provided. 

If I must select from the options, I would choose the closest logical option, but it does not align with the calculations. 

Thus, I will conclude with the answer based on the calculations: {'sol': '30'}."
"To find the zeros of the polynomial \( f(x) = x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x \) in the finite field \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), I will evaluate the polynomial at each element of \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), which consists of the elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

1. **Evaluate at \( x = 0 \)**:
   \[
   f(0) = 0^5 + 3 \cdot 0^3 + 0^2 + 2 \cdot 0 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 0 \) is a zero.

2. **Evaluate at \( x = 1 \)**:
   \[
   f(1) = 1^5 + 3 \cdot 1^3 + 1^2 + 2 \cdot 1 = 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 7 \equiv 2 \mod 5
   \]
   So, \( x = 1 \) is not a zero.

3. **Evaluate at \( x = 2 \)**:
   \[
   f(2) = 2^5 + 3 \cdot 2^3 + 2^2 + 2 \cdot 2 = 32 + 3 \cdot 8 + 4 + 4 = 32 + 24 + 4 + 4 = 64 \equiv 4 \mod 5
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is not a zero.

4. **Evaluate at \( x = 3 \)**:
   \[
   f(3) = 3^5 + 3 \cdot 3^3 + 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 = 243 + 3 \cdot 27 + 9 + 6 = 243 + 81 + 9 + 6 = 339 \equiv 4 \mod 5
   \]
   So, \( x = 3 \) is not a zero.

5. **Evaluate at \( x = 4 \)**:
   \[
   f(4) = 4^5 + 3 \cdot 4^3 + 4^2 + 2 \cdot 4 = 1024 + 3 \cdot 64 + 16 + 8 = 1024 + 192 + 16 + 8 = 1240 \equiv 0 \mod 5
   \]
   So, \( x = 4 \) is a zero.

After evaluating all elements in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), the zeros of the polynomial \( f(x) \) are \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 4 \).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian.
- A factor group (or quotient group) is formed by taking a group and dividing it by a normal subgroup. 
- If we take a non-Abelian group and a normal subgroup that does not ""collapse"" the non-Abelian structure, the resulting factor group can still be non-Abelian. However, it is also possible to choose a normal subgroup such that the factor group becomes Abelian. 
- Therefore, this statement is not universally true.

**Statement 2**: If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.
- By definition, if K is normal in H, then for any element h in H and k in K, the conjugate hkh^(-1) is in K. 
- Since H is normal in G, for any g in G and h in H, the conjugate ghg^(-1) is in H. 
- Therefore, for any g in G and k in K, we can express the conjugate as gk(g^(-1)) = (gh)(h^(-1)k(h)) which will still be in K because both H and K are normal in their respective groups. 
- Thus, K is indeed a normal subgroup of G.

Now, summarizing the evaluations:
- Statement 1 is False.
- Statement 2 is True.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To find the product of the polynomials \( f(x) = 4x - 5 \) and \( g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 \) in the ring \( \mathbb{Z}_8[x] \), I will follow these steps:

1. **Multiply the polynomials**: 
   \[
   f(x) \cdot g(x) = (4x - 5)(2x^2 - 4x + 2)
   \]
   We will distribute \( 4x \) and \( -5 \) across \( g(x) \):
   - \( 4x \cdot 2x^2 = 8x^3 \)
   - \( 4x \cdot (-4x) = -16x^2 \)
   - \( 4x \cdot 2 = 8x \)
   - \( -5 \cdot 2x^2 = -10x^2 \)
   - \( -5 \cdot (-4x) = 20x \)
   - \( -5 \cdot 2 = -10 \)

2. **Combine the results**:
   \[
   8x^3 + (-16x^2 - 10x^2) + (8x + 20x) - 10
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   8x^3 - 26x^2 + 28x - 10
   \]

3. **Reduce coefficients modulo 8**:
   - \( 8x^3 \equiv 0 \) (since \( 8 \mod 8 = 0 \))
   - \( -26x^2 \equiv 2x^2 \) (since \( -26 \mod 8 = 2 \))
   - \( 28x \equiv 4x \) (since \( 28 \mod 8 = 4 \))
   - \( -10 \equiv 6 \) (since \( -10 \mod 8 = 6 \))

   Therefore, the product simplifies to:
   \[
   0 + 2x^2 + 4x + 6 = 2x^2 + 4x + 6
   \]

Now, I will check the answer choices:
- a) \( 2x^2 + 5 \)
- b) \( 6x^2 + 4x + 6 \)
- c) \( 0 \)
- d) \( x^2 + 1 \)

The correct product is \( 2x^2 + 4x + 6 \), which matches choice b.

Thus, the final answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze them one by one.

**Statement 1**: If a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15.  
In group theory, if a group has an element of order \( n \), the subgroup generated by that element will have \( n \) elements. The number of elements of a specific order in a group is related to the structure of the group. For an element of order 15, the cyclic subgroup generated by that element will have 15 elements. However, the statement claims there must be at least 8 elements of order 15, which is not necessarily true. A group can have just one element of order 15 (the generator) and no other elements of that order. Therefore, this statement is **False**.

**Statement 2**: If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.  
If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it suggests that there are multiple elements generating subgroups of order 15. However, the number of elements of a specific order in a group is determined by the structure of the group. It is possible to have more than 8 elements of order 15 without reaching 16, depending on the group's structure. Thus, this statement is also **False**.

Combining the evaluations, we find that both statements are false.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To analyze the statements, let's break them down step by step.

1. **Statement 1**: ""Every homomorphic image of a group G is isomorphic to a factor group of G.""
   - A homomorphic image of a group G is obtained by applying a homomorphism from G to another group. The kernel of this homomorphism is a normal subgroup of G, and by the First Isomorphism Theorem, the image of the homomorphism is isomorphic to the quotient group G/ker(φ), where φ is the homomorphism. Therefore, this statement is true.

2. **Statement 2**: ""The homomorphic images of a group G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G.""
   - This statement suggests that all homomorphic images correspond directly to factor groups of G. However, while every homomorphic image is indeed isomorphic to a factor group, not every factor group corresponds to a homomorphic image. Factor groups are defined by normal subgroups, and there can be factor groups that do not arise from any homomorphism. Thus, this statement is false.

Based on the analysis:
- Statement 1 is true.
- Statement 2 is false.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: A ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel is {0}. 
- This statement is true. In ring theory, a ring homomorphism \( f: R \to S \) is injective (one-to-one) if and only if its kernel, which is the set of elements in \( R \) that map to the zero element in \( S \), contains only the zero element of \( R \). Therefore, if the kernel is {0}, it implies that no two distinct elements in \( R \) map to the same element in \( S \), confirming that the homomorphism is injective.

**Statement 2**: Q is an ideal in R.
- This statement is false. The set of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q} \) is not an ideal in the ring of integers \( \mathbb{R} \). An ideal must be closed under addition and must absorb multiplication by any element of the ring. While \( \mathbb{Q} \) is closed under addition, it is not closed under multiplication by integers (for example, multiplying a rational number by an integer can yield a non-rational number).

Combining the evaluations of both statements, we find that Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To find the degree of the field extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \), I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the minimal polynomial**: First, I need to express \( \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} \) in a way that allows me to find its minimal polynomial over \( \mathbb{Q} \). Let \( x = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} \). Squaring both sides gives:
   \[
   x^2 = 2 + 3 + 2\sqrt{6} = 5 + 2\sqrt{6}.
   \]
   Rearranging this, we have:
   \[
   x^2 - 5 = 2\sqrt{6}.
   \]
   Squaring again to eliminate the square root yields:
   \[
   (x^2 - 5)^2 = 4 \cdot 6 = 24.
   \]
   Expanding this gives:
   \[
   x^4 - 10x^2 + 25 = 24.
   \]
   Simplifying leads to:
   \[
   x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 = 0.
   \]

2. **Determine the degree of the polynomial**: The polynomial \( x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 \) is a polynomial of degree 4. To find the degree of the field extension, I need to check if this polynomial is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Q} \).

3. **Check for irreducibility**: To check if \( x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 \) is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Q} \), I can use the Rational Root Theorem or check for possible factorizations. Since it does not have rational roots (as can be verified by testing possible rational roots), and it cannot be factored into polynomials of lower degree with rational coefficients, it is irreducible.

Since the minimal polynomial of \( \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is of degree 4, the degree of the field extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is 4.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To find the zeros of the polynomial \( x^3 + 2x + 2 \) in the finite field \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \), I will evaluate the polynomial at each element of \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \), which consists of the integers {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

1. **Evaluate at \( x = 0 \)**:
   \[
   P(0) = 0^3 + 2 \cdot 0 + 2 = 2 \quad (\text{not a zero})
   \]

2. **Evaluate at \( x = 1 \)**:
   \[
   P(1) = 1^3 + 2 \cdot 1 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \quad (\text{not a zero})
   \]

3. **Evaluate at \( x = 2 \)**:
   \[
   P(2) = 2^3 + 2 \cdot 2 + 2 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \quad (\text{is a zero})
   \]

4. **Evaluate at \( x = 3 \)**:
   \[
   P(3) = 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 = 27 + 6 + 2 = 35 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \quad (\text{is a zero})
   \]

5. **Evaluate at \( x = 4 \)**:
   \[
   P(4) = 4^3 + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 = 64 + 8 + 2 = 74 \equiv 4 \mod 7 \quad (\text{not a zero})
   \]

6. **Evaluate at \( x = 5 \)**:
   \[
   P(5) = 5^3 + 2 \cdot 5 + 2 = 125 + 10 + 2 = 137 \equiv 4 \mod 7 \quad (\text{not a zero})
   \]

7. **Evaluate at \( x = 6 \)**:
   \[
   P(6) = 6^3 + 2 \cdot 6 + 2 = 216 + 12 + 2 = 230 \equiv 5 \mod 7 \quad (\text{not a zero})
   \]

After evaluating the polynomial at all elements of \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \), I found that the zeros are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: If H is a subgroup of G and a belongs to G then |aH| = |Ha|. 
- The left coset aH consists of all elements of the form ah for h in H, and the right coset Ha consists of all elements of the form ha for h in H. 
- Both cosets have the same number of elements, which is equal to the order of the subgroup H. Therefore, |aH| = |Ha| is true.

**Statement 2**: If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G, then aH and Hb are identical or disjoint.
- This statement is not necessarily true. The cosets aH and Hb can overlap, meaning they can share some elements. For example, if a and b are such that aH intersects Hb, they are not disjoint. Thus, this statement is false.

Based on the analysis:
- Statement 1 is True.
- Statement 2 is False.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the properties of the relation S = {(1, 1), (2, 2)} on the set A = {1, 2, 3}, I will analyze the definitions of symmetric, anti-symmetric, and equivalence relations.

1. **Symmetric Relation**: A relation R is symmetric if for every (a, b) in R, (b, a) is also in R. In this case, S contains (1, 1) and (2, 2), which are reflexive pairs. There are no pairs (a, b) where a ≠ b, so the condition for symmetry is trivially satisfied. Thus, S is symmetric.

2. **Anti-symmetric Relation**: A relation R is anti-symmetric if for every (a, b) in R, if (b, a) is also in R, then a must equal b. In this case, the only pairs in S are (1, 1) and (2, 2), which satisfy the condition since there are no pairs (a, b) where a ≠ b. Therefore, S is also anti-symmetric.

3. **Equivalence Relation**: A relation is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. S is not reflexive for all elements in A because it does not include (3, 3). Therefore, S is not an equivalence relation.

Based on this analysis, the relation S is symmetric and anti-symmetric, but not an equivalence relation. 

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To find the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>), I will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the order of the group Z_11 x Z_15**: The order of a direct product of two groups is the product of their orders. The order of Z_11 is 11 and the order of Z_15 is 15. Therefore, the order of Z_11 x Z_15 is 11 * 15 = 165.

2. **Determine the order of the subgroup <(1, 1)>**: The subgroup generated by (1, 1) consists of all integer multiples of (1, 1). Since Z_11 has 11 elements and Z_15 has 15 elements, the order of the subgroup <(1, 1)> is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of the two groups. The LCM of 11 and 15 is 165, so the order of the subgroup <(1, 1)> is 1.

3. **Calculate the order of the factor group**: The order of the factor group is given by the formula |G| / |H|, where |G| is the order of the group and |H| is the order of the subgroup. Thus, the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>) is 165 / 1 = 165.

Since 165 is not one of the options provided, I will check the calculations again. The subgroup <(1, 1)> is indeed trivial, and the order of the factor group is simply the order of the group itself.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To factor the polynomial \( x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_7[x] \), I will follow these steps:

1. **Check for Roots**: I will evaluate the polynomial at each element of \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \) (0 through 6) to find any roots. A root \( r \) satisfies \( f(r) \equiv 0 \mod 7 \).

2. **Evaluate the Polynomial**:
   - \( f(0) = 0^3 + 2(0^2) + 2(0) + 1 = 1 \) (not a root)
   - \( f(1) = 1^3 + 2(1^2) + 2(1) + 1 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 \) (not a root)
   - \( f(2) = 2^3 + 2(2^2) + 2(2) + 1 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 21 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \) (is a root)
   - \( f(3) = 3^3 + 2(3^2) + 2(3) + 1 = 27 + 18 + 6 + 1 = 52 \equiv 3 \mod 7 \) (not a root)
   - \( f(4) = 4^3 + 2(4^2) + 2(4) + 1 = 64 + 32 + 8 + 1 = 105 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \) (is a root)
   - \( f(5) = 5^3 + 2(5^2) + 2(5) + 1 = 125 + 50 + 10 + 1 = 186 \equiv 5 \mod 7 \) (not a root)
   - \( f(6) = 6^3 + 2(6^2) + 2(6) + 1 = 216 + 72 + 12 + 1 = 301 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \) (is a root)

3. **Factor the Polynomial**: Since \( x = 2 \), \( x = 4 \), and \( x = 6 \) are roots, I can express the polynomial as:
   \[
   f(x) = (x - 2)(x - 4)(x - 6)
   \]
   However, since we are working in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \), we can rewrite \( x - 6 \) as \( x + 1 \) (because \( -6 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \)). Thus, the factorization becomes:
   \[
   f(x) = (x - 2)(x - 4)(x + 1)
   \]

Now, I will match this factorization with the provided choices:
- a) \( (x - 2)(x + 2)(x - 1) \)
- b) \( (x + 1)(x + 4)(x - 2) \)
- c) \( (x + 1)(x - 4)(x - 2) \)
- d) \( (x - 1)(x - 4)(x - 2) \)

The correct factorization is \( (x - 2)(x - 4)(x + 1) \), which corresponds to choice c) \( (x + 1)(x - 4)(x - 2) \).

Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To find the maximum possible order of an element in the symmetric group \( S_n \), we need to consider the cycle structure of permutations. The order of a permutation is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of its disjoint cycles.

1. For \( n = 10 \), we can create different cycle structures. The goal is to maximize the LCM of the cycle lengths while ensuring the total number of elements in the cycles equals 10.

2. Let's consider some possible cycle structures:
   - A single cycle of length 10: The order is \( \text{lcm}(10) = 10 \).
   - Two cycles: For example, one cycle of length 5 and another of length 5: The order is \( \text{lcm}(5, 5) = 5 \).
   - A cycle of length 6 and a cycle of length 4: The order is \( \text{lcm}(6, 4) = 12 \).
   - A cycle of length 3 and a cycle of length 7: The order is \( \text{lcm}(3, 7) = 21 \).
   - A cycle of length 2 and a cycle of length 8: The order is \( \text{lcm}(2, 8) = 8 \).
   - A cycle of length 1 and a cycle of length 9: The order is \( \text{lcm}(1, 9) = 9 \).

3. The maximum order can be achieved by combining cycles in a way that maximizes the LCM. The combination of cycles of lengths 5 and 5 gives an order of 5, while a combination of cycles of lengths 6 and 4 gives an order of 12. 

4. However, we can also consider the combination of cycles of lengths 3, 3, and 4, which gives \( \text{lcm}(3, 3, 4) = 12 \). 

5. The combination of cycles of lengths 5, 2, and 3 gives \( \text{lcm}(5, 2, 3) = 30 \).

6. Finally, the combination of cycles of lengths 7 and 3 gives \( \text{lcm}(7, 3) = 21 \), and the combination of cycles of lengths 5, 4, and 1 gives \( \text{lcm}(5, 4, 1) = 20 \).

After evaluating these combinations, the maximum order found is 30.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To evaluate the truth of the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1:** R is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q.
- A splitting field is a field extension in which a polynomial splits into linear factors. Since R (the field of real numbers) can be seen as a splitting field for the polynomial \(x^2 + 1\) over the field of rational numbers Q (as it splits into linear factors over the complex numbers, which include R), this statement is true.

**Statement 2:** There is a field with 60 elements.
- A finite field exists if and only if the number of elements is a power of a prime. The number 60 can be factored into primes as \(60 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5\). Since 60 is not a power of a single prime, there cannot be a field with exactly 60 elements. Therefore, this statement is false.

Combining the evaluations:
- Statement 1 is True.
- Statement 2 is False.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To find the inverse of -i in the multiplicative group {1, -1, i, -i}, I need to determine which element, when multiplied by -i, results in the identity element of the group, which is 1.

1. I will multiply -i by each of the elements in the group:
   - (-i) * 1 = -i
   - (-i) * (-1) = i
   - (-i) * i = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1
   - (-i) * (-i) = i^2 = -1

2. From the calculations, I see that when I multiply -i by i, the result is 1. This means that i is the inverse of -i.

3. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

   Now, we take \( 6 \mod 5 \):
   \[
   6 \mod 5 = 1
   \]

2. **Multiply the second components**: 
   The second components are 3 and 5. We compute \( 3 \times 5 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_9 \):
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15
   \]
   Now, we take \( 15 \mod 9 \):
   \[
   15 \mod 9 = 6
   \]

3. **Combine the results**: 
   The product in the ring \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \times \mathbb{Z}_9 \) is given by combining the results from the first and second components:
   \[
   (1, 6)
   \]

Thus, the product of (2,3) and (3,5) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \times \mathbb{Z}_9 \) is \( (1, 6) \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine why the set of all real numbers under multiplication is not a group, let's analyze the properties of a group:

1. **Binary Operation**: A group must have a binary operation that combines any two elements of the set to produce another element in the set. In this case, multiplication is indeed a binary operation for real numbers.

2. **Associativity**: A group must satisfy the associative property, meaning that for any three elements a, b, and c in the set, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c). Multiplication of real numbers is associative.

3. **Identity Element**: A group must have an identity element such that for any element a in the set, there exists an element e (the identity) where a * e = a. The identity element for multiplication is 1, which exists in the set of real numbers.

4. **Inverses**: For every element a in the group, there must be an inverse element b such that a * b = e (the identity element). In the case of multiplication, the inverse of a non-zero real number a is 1/a. However, the number 0 does not have an inverse since there is no real number b such that 0 * b = 1.

Given this analysis, the reason the set of all real numbers under multiplication is not a group is that zero does not have an inverse.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: ""Every group of order p^2 where p is prime is Abelian.""
- A group of order p^2 can either be cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p. Both types of groups are Abelian. Therefore, this statement is true.

**Statement 2**: ""For a fixed prime p, a Sylow p-subgroup of a group G is a normal subgroup of G if and only if it is the only Sylow p-subgroup of G.""
- This statement is also true. By Sylow's theorems, if a Sylow p-subgroup is the only one in the group, it must be normal. Conversely, if a Sylow p-subgroup is normal, it is the only Sylow p-subgroup because all Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate to each other.

Since both statements are true, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To evaluate the truth of the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: For finite groups G and H, |G + H| = |G||H|. 
- The internal direct product of two groups G and H, denoted as G + H, is defined when G and H are normal subgroups of a group and their intersection is trivial. 
- If G and H are finite groups, the order of the internal direct product is indeed the product of the orders of the two groups, i.e., |G + H| = |G| * |H|. 
- Therefore, Statement 1 is **True**.

**Statement 2**: If r divides m and s divides n then Z_m + Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s.
- The group Z_m + Z_n is the direct sum of the cyclic groups of order m and n. 
- If r divides m, then there exists a subgroup of Z_m isomorphic to Z_r. Similarly, if s divides n, there exists a subgroup of Z_n isomorphic to Z_s.
- The direct sum of these subgroups will give us a subgroup of Z_m + Z_n that is isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s.
- Therefore, Statement 2 is also **True**.

Since both statements are true, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to add the two polynomials \( f(x) = 4x - 5 \) and \( g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 \) in the polynomial ring \( \mathbb{Z}_8[x] \).

1. I will align the polynomials by their degrees:
   - \( f(x) = 0x^2 + 4x - 5 \)
   - \( g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 \)

2. Now, I will add the coefficients of the corresponding terms:
   - For \( x^2 \): \( 0 + 2 = 2 \)
   - For \( x \): \( 4 - 4 = 0 \)
   - For the constant term: \( -5 + 2 = -3 \). In \( \mathbb{Z}_8 \), \( -3 \) is equivalent to \( 5 \) (since \( -3 + 8 = 5 \)).

3. Therefore, the sum of the polynomials is:
   \[
   2x^2 + 0x + 5 = 2x^2 + 5
   \]

Now, I will check the answer choices:
- a) \( 2x^2 + 5 \)
- b) \( 6x^2 + 4x + 6 \)
- c) \( 0 \)
- d) \( x^2 + 1 \)

The correct answer is \( 2x^2 + 5 \).

Thus, the final answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: ""Any set of two vectors in R^2 is linearly independent.""
- In R^2, two vectors are linearly independent if they are not scalar multiples of each other. However, if we take two vectors that are parallel (e.g., (1, 2) and (2, 4)), they are linearly dependent. Therefore, this statement is false.

**Statement 2**: ""If V = span(v1, ... , vk) and {v1, ... , vk} are linearly independent, then dim(V) = k.""
- This statement is true. If the vectors {v1, ... , vk} are linearly independent, then the dimension of the span of these vectors (V) is equal to the number of vectors, which is k.

Now, combining the evaluations:
- Statement 1 is False.
- Statement 2 is True.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the properties of the set of all nth roots of unity under multiplication of complex numbers.

1. **Definition of nth roots of unity**: The nth roots of unity are the complex numbers of the form \( e^{2\pi i k/n} \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 \). There are exactly n such roots.

2. **Closure**: The product of any two nth roots of unity is also an nth root of unity. This is because multiplying two complex exponentials results in another complex exponential of the same form.

3. **Identity element**: The identity element in this set is \( e^{2\pi i \cdot 0/n} = 1 \), which is one of the nth roots of unity.

4. **Inverses**: Each nth root of unity has an inverse that is also an nth root of unity. Specifically, the inverse of \( e^{2\pi i k/n} \) is \( e^{-2\pi i k/n} \), which can be rewritten as \( e^{2\pi i (n-k)/n} \), another root of unity.

5. **Associativity**: The multiplication of complex numbers is associative.

6. **Commutativity**: The multiplication of complex numbers is also commutative.

Given these properties, we can conclude that the set of all nth roots of unity forms a group under multiplication, and since it is also commutative, it is specifically an abelian group.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: ""Every maximal ideal is a prime ideal.""
- A maximal ideal is defined as an ideal I in a ring R such that there are no other ideals in R that contain I except for R itself. 
- A prime ideal is defined as an ideal P in a ring R such that if the product of two elements a and b is in P, then at least one of a or b must be in P.
- It is a known result in ring theory that every maximal ideal is indeed a prime ideal. Therefore, Statement 1 is **True**.

**Statement 2**: ""If I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R, then R/I is a field.""
- By definition, if I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R, the quotient ring R/I is a field. This is because the only ideals in the field R/I are the zero ideal and the field itself, which satisfies the definition of a field.
- Therefore, Statement 2 is also **True**.

Since both statements are true, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the nature of the set \( G \) of all \( n \times n \) non-singular matrices with rational numbers as entries under multiplication, we can analyze the properties of this set step by step.

1. **Non-singular Matrices**: A non-singular matrix is one that has an inverse. The set of all non-singular matrices forms a group under matrix multiplication because:
   - The product of two non-singular matrices is non-singular.
   - The identity matrix is non-singular and serves as the identity element.
   - Every non-singular matrix has an inverse, which is also non-singular.

2. **Infinite Group**: The set \( G \) is infinite because there are infinitely many rational numbers, and thus we can construct infinitely many non-singular matrices by varying the entries. For example, we can create matrices with rational entries that are linearly independent, ensuring they are non-singular.

3. **Non-abelian Group**: The group of non-singular matrices is generally non-abelian for \( n \geq 2 \). This means that the order of multiplication matters; that is, for some matrices \( A \) and \( B \) in \( G \), \( AB \neq BA \).

Based on these observations, we conclude that \( G \) is an infinite, non-abelian group.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To analyze the statements, we will use the Sylow theorems.

1. **Statement 1**: ""Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7.""
   - The order of the group is 42, which factors as \( 42 = 2 \times 3 \times 7 \).
   - According to Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, denoted \( n_7 \), must divide 42 and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. The only values that satisfy both conditions are \( n_7 = 1 \) or \( n_7 = 7 \). If \( n_7 = 1 \), then there is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, which must be normal.
   - Therefore, Statement 1 is **True**.

2. **Statement 2**: ""Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8.""
   - The order of the group is 42, which does not have 8 as a divisor (since \( 8 = 2^3 \) and 42 does not contain \( 2^3 \) in its prime factorization).
   - Therefore, it is impossible for a group of order 42 to have a subgroup of order 8.
   - Thus, Statement 2 is **False**.

Combining the results, we have:
- Statement 1: True
- Statement 2: False

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine whether the polynomial \( 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 9x + 24 \) satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over \( \mathbb{Q} \), we will check the conditions for different primes \( p \).

1. **Eisenstein Criterion**: A polynomial \( f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_0 \) is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Q} \) if there exists a prime \( p \) such that:
   - \( p \) divides \( a_i \) for all \( i < n \) (the coefficients of lower degree terms),
   - \( p \) does not divide \( a_n \) (the leading coefficient),
   - \( p^2 \) does not divide \( a_0 \) (the constant term).

2. **Checking for \( p = 2 \)**:
   - The coefficients are \( 8, 6, -9, 24 \).
   - \( p = 2 \) divides \( 6 \) (coefficient of \( x^2 \)), \( -9 \) (coefficient of \( x \)), and \( 24 \) (constant term).
   - \( p = 2 \) does not divide \( 8 \) (leading coefficient).
   - However, \( p^2 = 4 \) does divide \( 24 \). Thus, it does not satisfy the Eisenstein criterion for \( p = 2 \).

3. **Checking for \( p = 3 \)**:
   - \( p = 3 \) divides \( 6 \) (coefficient of \( x^2 \)), \( -9 \) (coefficient of \( x \)), and \( 24 \) (constant term).
   - \( p = 3 \) does not divide \( 8 \) (leading coefficient).
   - However, \( p^2 = 9 \) does divide \( -9 \). Thus, it does not satisfy the Eisenstein criterion for \( p = 3 \).

4. **Checking for \( p = 5 \)**:
   - \( p = 5 \) does not divide \( 8 \) (leading coefficient).
   - \( p = 5 \) does not divide \( 6 \) (coefficient of \( x^2 \)).
   - \( p = 5 \) does not divide \( -9 \) (coefficient of \( x \)).
   - \( p = 5 \) does not divide \( 24 \) (constant term).
   - Therefore, it does not satisfy the Eisenstein criterion for \( p = 5 \).

5. **Conclusion**: Since none of the primes \( p = 2, 3, 5 \) satisfy the Eisenstein criterion, the polynomial does not satisfy the criterion for irreducibility over \( \mathbb{Q} \).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To analyze the statements, let's break them down step by step.

1. **Statement 1**: ""The image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism may have 12 elements.""
   - A homomorphism maps elements from one group to another, and the image of a group under a homomorphism can have a number of elements that is less than or equal to the number of elements in the original group. The image cannot have more elements than the original group. Therefore, the image of a group of 6 elements cannot have 12 elements. This statement is **False**.

2. **Statement 2**: ""There is a homomorphism of some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements.""
   - A homomorphism can be defined from a group of 6 elements (let's say a group G with |G| = 6) into a group of 12 elements (let's say a group H with |H| = 12). Since there are no restrictions preventing a homomorphism from being defined between groups of different sizes, this statement is **True**.

Combining the evaluations of both statements, we have:
- Statement 1: False
- Statement 2: True

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

1. **Statement 1**: The homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic.
   - A cyclic group is generated by a single element. If we have a homomorphism from a cyclic group \( G \) to another group \( H \), the image of \( G \) under this homomorphism will also be generated by the image of the generator of \( G \). Therefore, the image will also be cyclic. This statement is **True**.

2. **Statement 2**: The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian.
   - An Abelian group is one where the group operation is commutative. If we have a homomorphism from an Abelian group \( G \) to another group \( H \), the image of \( G \) under this homomorphism will inherit the commutativity property because for any two elements \( a, b \in G \), we have \( f(ab) = f(a)f(b) \) and since \( ab = ba \) in \( G \), it follows that \( f(a)f(b) = f(b)f(a) \) in \( H \). Thus, the image will also be Abelian. This statement is also **True**.

Combining the evaluations, both statements are true.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: ""If H is a subgroup of a group G and a belongs to G, then aH = Ha.""
- This statement is not necessarily true for all subgroups. The equality aH = Ha holds only if H is a normal subgroup of G. Therefore, this statement is **False**.

**Statement 2**: ""If H is normal in G and a belongs to G, then ah = ha for all h in H.""
- This statement is true by the definition of a normal subgroup. If H is normal in G, then for every element a in G and every element h in H, the equation ah = ha holds. Therefore, this statement is **True**.

Combining the evaluations of both statements, we find that Statement 1 is False and Statement 2 is True.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the nature of the group \( G \) given the property \( (ab)^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1} \), we can analyze the implications of this property step by step.

1. **Understanding the Inverse Property**: The property \( (ab)^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1} \) is a specific characteristic of groups. In standard group theory, the inverse of a product of two elements is given by \( (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1} \). The given property suggests that the order of multiplication matters, which is a key point in determining whether the group is abelian or not.

2. **Testing Commutativity**: To check if \( G \) is abelian (commutative), we can set \( a = x \) and \( b = y \) for arbitrary elements \( x, y \in G \). According to the property, we have:
   \[
   (xy)^{-1} = x^{-1}y^{-1}
   \]
   However, using the standard property of inverses, we also have:
   \[
   (xy)^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}
   \]
   For these two expressions to be equal, we must have:
   \[
   x^{-1}y^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}
   \]
   This implies that \( xy = yx \) for all \( x, y \in G \), which means \( G \) is abelian.

3. **Conclusion**: Since we have established that the group \( G \) satisfies the condition for being abelian, we can conclude that \( G \) is indeed an abelian group.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: ""In a finite dimensional vector space every linearly independent set of vectors is contained in a basis.""
- In a finite-dimensional vector space, a basis is defined as a maximal linearly independent set of vectors. This means that any linearly independent set of vectors can be extended to form a basis. Therefore, this statement is true.

**Statement 2**: ""If B_1 and B_2 are bases for the same vector space, then |B_1| = |B_2|.""
- This statement is a consequence of the dimension theorem in linear algebra, which states that all bases of a finite-dimensional vector space have the same number of elements (i.e., the same cardinality). Therefore, this statement is also true.

Since both statements are true, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which statement is true for an abelian group (G, 0), let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Option a: g = g^-1 for every g in G**
   - This statement implies that every element is its own inverse. While this is true for some abelian groups (like the group of integers modulo 2), it is not true for all abelian groups. For example, in the group of integers under addition, the inverse of an element g is -g, which is not equal to g unless g is 0.

2. **Option b: g = g^2 for every g in G**
   - This statement implies that every element is idempotent. This is not true for general abelian groups. For instance, in the group of integers under addition, g is not equal to g + g (which is 2g) unless g is 0 or 1.

3. **Option c: (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G**
   - In an abelian group, the operation is commutative. The left-hand side expands to (g + h) + (g + h) = g + h + g + h = 2g + 2h. The right-hand side expands to g + g + h + h = 2g + 2h. Thus, this statement holds true for all g, h in G.

4. **Option d: G is of finite order**
   - This statement is not necessarily true for abelian groups. There are infinite abelian groups, such as the group of integers under addition, which has infinite order.

After analyzing all options, the only statement that holds true for all abelian groups is option c.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: If T: V -> W is a linear transformation and dim(V) < dim(W) < 1, then T must be injective.
- The condition dim(W) < 1 implies that dim(W) can only be 0 (since dimensions are non-negative integers). Therefore, W is the zero vector space.
- If dim(V) < dim(W), then dim(V) must also be less than 0, which is impossible. Hence, this statement is vacuously true because the premise cannot hold.

**Statement 2**: Let dim(V) = n and suppose that T: V -> V is linear. If T is injective, then it is a bijection.
- For a linear transformation from a finite-dimensional vector space to itself, if T is injective, it must also be surjective (and thus bijective) because the dimensions of the domain and codomain are equal (both are n). This is a fundamental property of linear transformations in finite-dimensional spaces.

Now, we can summarize the truth values of the statements:
- Statement 1 is True (vacuously true).
- Statement 2 is True (injective implies bijective in finite dimensions).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To find the degree of the field extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \), I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the individual extensions**: First, consider the extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \). The minimal polynomial of \( \sqrt{2} \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is \( x^2 - 2 \), which is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Q} \). Therefore, the degree of the extension \( [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}):\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \).

2. **Consider the next extension**: Next, consider the extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \). The minimal polynomial of \( \sqrt{3} \) over \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \) is \( x^2 - 3 \). We need to check if this polynomial is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \). Since \( \sqrt{3} \) is not expressible as \( a + b\sqrt{2} \) for any rational \( a, b \), the polynomial \( x^2 - 3 \) remains irreducible over \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \). Thus, \( [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}):\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})] = 2 \).

3. **Combine the degrees**: Now, we can find the total degree of the extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) using the multiplicative property of degrees of field extensions:
   \[
   [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}):\mathbb{Q}] = [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}):\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})] \cdot [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}):\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \cdot 2 = 4.
   \]

Therefore, the degree of the field extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is 4.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to compute the product of 20 and -8. 

1. Calculate the product: 
   \( 20 \times -8 = -160 \).

2. Next, I need to reduce -160 modulo 26. To do this, I can add 26 repeatedly until I get a non-negative result:
   \(-160 + 26 \times 7 = -160 + 182 = 22\).

3. Now, I have the result of the product in \( \mathbb{Z}_{26} \), which is 22.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine whether the polynomial \( x^2 - 12 \) satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over \( \mathbb{Q} \), I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the polynomial**: The polynomial is \( f(x) = x^2 - 12 \).

2. **Check for Eisenstein's criterion**: According to Eisenstein's criterion, a polynomial \( f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_0 \) is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Q} \) if there exists a prime \( p \) such that:
   - \( p \) divides \( a_i \) for all \( i < n \) (the coefficients of lower degree terms),
   - \( p \) does not divide \( a_n \) (the leading coefficient),
   - \( p^2 \) does not divide \( a_0 \) (the constant term).

3. **Apply the criterion**: For the polynomial \( x^2 - 12 \):
   - The leading coefficient \( a_2 = 1 \) (which is not divisible by any prime \( p \)).
   - The constant term \( a_0 = -12 \).
   - The coefficients of lower degree terms: \( a_1 = 0 \).

Now, let's check the primes:

- For \( p = 2 \):
  - \( 2 \) does not divide \( 1 \) (the leading coefficient).
  - \( 2 \) divides \( 0 \) (the coefficient of \( x \)).
  - \( 2^2 = 4 \) does not divide \( -12 \).
  - Thus, it does not satisfy the criterion.

- For \( p = 3 \):
  - \( 3 \) does not divide \( 1 \).
  - \( 3 \) divides \( 0 \).
  - \( 3^2 = 9 \) does not divide \( -12 \).
  - Thus, it does not satisfy the criterion.

- For \( p = 5 \):
  - \( 5 \) does not divide \( 1 \).
  - \( 5 \) divides \( 0 \).
  - \( 5^2 = 25 \) does not divide \( -12 \).
  - Thus, it does not satisfy the criterion.

Since none of the primes satisfy all conditions of the Eisenstein criterion, the polynomial \( x^2 - 12 \) does not satisfy the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over \( \mathbb{Q} \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To find a generator for the finite field \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \), we need to identify an element that can generate all non-zero elements of the field through its powers.

1. The elements of \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \) are \( \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \). The non-zero elements are \( \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \).
2. A generator \( g \) must satisfy the condition that the powers \( g^1, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6 \) (mod 7) yield all the non-zero elements.
3. We will test each option to see if it can generate all non-zero elements.

- For \( g = 1 \):
  - \( 1^1 = 1 \)
  - Only generates \( \{1\} \).

- For \( g = 2 \):
  - \( 2^1 = 2 \)
  - \( 2^2 = 4 \)
  - \( 2^3 = 8 \equiv 1 \) (mod 7)
  - Only generates \( \{1, 2, 4\} \).

- For \( g = 3 \):
  - \( 3^1 = 3 \)
  - \( 3^2 = 9 \equiv 2 \) (mod 7)
  - \( 3^3 = 27 \equiv 6 \) (mod 7)
  - \( 3^4 = 18 \equiv 4 \) (mod 7)
  - \( 3^5 = 12 \equiv 5 \) (mod 7)
  - \( 3^6 = 15 \equiv 1 \) (mod 7)
  - Generates \( \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \).

- For \( g = 4 \):
  - \( 4^1 = 4 \)
  - \( 4^2 = 16 \equiv 2 \) (mod 7)
  - \( 4^3 = 64 \equiv 1 \) (mod 7)
  - Only generates \( \{1, 2, 4\} \).

From the calculations, the only element that generates all non-zero elements of \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \) is \( 3 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

1. **Statement 1: Every permutation is a cycle.**
   - A permutation is a rearrangement of elements in a set. While every permutation can be expressed as a product of cycles (which is a representation of the permutation), not every permutation is a single cycle. For example, the permutation that swaps two elements in a set of three is not a cycle by itself. Therefore, this statement is **False**.

2. **Statement 2: Every cycle is a permutation.**
   - A cycle is a specific type of permutation where a subset of elements is rotated among themselves while the rest remain fixed. Since cycles are indeed a form of rearrangement of elements, this statement is **True**.

Combining the evaluations of both statements, we conclude:
- Statement 1 is False.
- Statement 2 is True.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the identity element of the group defined by the operation \( a * b = a + b + 1 \), I will follow these steps:

1. **Definition of Identity Element**: An identity element \( e \) in a group must satisfy the condition \( a * e = a \) and \( e * a = a \) for all elements \( a \) in the group.

2. **Finding the Identity Element**: Let's set \( e \) as the identity element. According to the operation defined:
   - For \( a * e = a \):
     \[
     a * e = a + e + 1 = a
     \]
     Rearranging gives:
     \[
     e + 1 = 0 \implies e = -1
     \]

3. **Verification**: Now, I will verify if \( e = -1 \) satisfies the identity condition:
   - For \( e * a = a \):
     \[
     e * a = -1 + a + 1 = a
     \]
   This holds true as well.

Since both conditions are satisfied, the identity element of the group is \( -1 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To find the characteristic of the ring \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \times 3\mathbb{Z} \), we need to analyze the components of the ring.

1. The characteristic of \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is 3, because adding the element 1 three times gives us 0 (i.e., \( 1 + 1 + 1 = 0 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)).
2. The characteristic of \( 3\mathbb{Z} \) is 0, because \( 3\mathbb{Z} \) is the set of all integer multiples of 3, and there is no finite number of additions of 1 that will yield 0 in this set.
3. The characteristic of a direct product of rings is the least common multiple (LCM) of the characteristics of the individual rings. Therefore, we need to find the LCM of 3 (from \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) and 0 (from \( 3\mathbb{Z} \)).

Since the LCM of any number with 0 is the number itself, the characteristic of the ring \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \times 3\mathbb{Z} \) is 3.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: ""Some abelian group of order 45 has a subgroup of order 10.""
1. The order of the group is 45, which can be factored as \( 3^2 \times 5 \).
2. By the Sylow theorems, we can find the number of Sylow subgroups. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups \( n_5 \) must divide \( 9 \) (which is \( 3^2 \)) and be congruent to \( 1 \mod 5 \). The possible values for \( n_5 \) are \( 1 \) or \( 9 \). If \( n_5 = 1 \), there is a normal Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5.
3. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups \( n_3 \) must divide \( 5 \) and be congruent to \( 1 \mod 3 \). The possible values for \( n_3 \) are \( 1 \) or \( 5 \). If \( n_3 = 1 \), there is a normal Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9.
4. If both Sylow subgroups are normal, the group is isomorphic to the direct product of these subgroups, which would have a subgroup of order \( 10 \) (since \( 10 = 2 \times 5 \)).
5. Therefore, Statement 1 is **True**.

**Statement 2**: ""A subgroup H of a group G is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of H is equal to the number of right cosets of H.""
1. By definition, a subgroup \( H \) is normal in \( G \) if \( gH = Hg \) for all \( g \in G \).
2. The number of left cosets of \( H \) in \( G \) is given by \( |G|/|H| \), and the number of right cosets is also \( |G|/|H| \).
3. Thus, the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets for any subgroup \( H \) of \( G \).
4. However, the condition of having equal numbers of left and right cosets does not imply that \( H \) is normal. A subgroup can have the same number of left and right cosets without being normal.
5. Therefore, Statement 2 is **False**.

Combining the evaluations, we have:
- Statement 1: True
- Statement 2: False

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: ""Every integral domain with characteristic 0 is infinite.""
- An integral domain is a commutative ring with no zero divisors and a multiplicative identity. The characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( n \cdot 1 = 0 \) (if such \( n \) exists), or 0 if no such \( n \) exists.
- If an integral domain has characteristic 0, it means that there is no positive integer \( n \) such that \( n \cdot 1 = 0 \). This implies that the elements can be indefinitely added without reaching zero, which leads to the conclusion that the set of elements must be infinite.
- Therefore, Statement 1 is **True**.

**Statement 2**: ""Every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite.""
- An integral domain with prime characteristic \( p \) means that \( p \cdot 1 = 0 \) for some prime \( p \). This does not imply that the integral domain must be finite. For example, the field of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q} \) is an integral domain, and it has characteristic 0, while the field of integers modulo \( p \) (where \( p \) is prime) is finite.
- Therefore, Statement 2 is **False**.

Combining the evaluations of both statements, we find that Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is False.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To analyze the statements regarding the functions f and g, let's break down the implications of the condition g(f(a)) = a for all a in A.

1. **Injectivity of f**: 
   - For f to be injective, it must hold that if f(a1) = f(a2), then a1 = a2 for any a1, a2 in A. 
   - Given g(f(a)) = a, if we assume f(a1) = f(a2), then applying g gives us g(f(a1)) = g(f(a2)), which implies a1 = a2. 
   - Therefore, f must be injective.

2. **Surjectivity of f**: 
   - For f to be surjective, for every b in B, there must exist an a in A such that f(a) = b.
   - The condition g(f(a)) = a does not guarantee that every b in B is the image of some a in A under f. 
   - It is possible for f to not cover all elements of B, meaning f does not have to be surjective.

Based on this analysis, we conclude:
- Statement 1 is True (f is injective).
- Statement 2 is False (f is not necessarily surjective).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

1. **Statement 1**: ""For any two groups G and G', there exists a homomorphism of G into G'."" 
   - This statement is **False**. A homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two groups. While it is true that there exists at least one homomorphism from any group G to the trivial group (where every element maps to the identity), it is not true that there exists a homomorphism from every group G to every other group G'. For example, if G is a non-trivial group and G' is the trivial group, there is no non-trivial homomorphism from G to G'.

2. **Statement 2**: ""Every homomorphism is a one-to-one map.""
   - This statement is also **False**. A homomorphism can be one-to-one (injective), but it is not necessarily so. For example, the homomorphism from the group of integers under addition to the group of integers modulo n (for n > 1) is not one-to-one, as multiple integers will map to the same equivalence class in the modulo group.

Based on the analysis, both statements are false.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: A homomorphism may have an empty kernel.
- The kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements that map to the identity element of the codomain. A homomorphism can have a trivial kernel (only the identity element of the domain) or a nontrivial kernel (more than just the identity). However, the kernel cannot be empty because the identity element of the domain must map to the identity element of the codomain. Therefore, this statement is **False**.

**Statement 2**: It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group.
- A nontrivial homomorphism means that there exists at least one element in the finite group that does not map to the identity of the infinite group. However, it is indeed possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism from a finite group to an infinite group. For example, consider the finite group \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) (which has two elements) and the infinite group \( \mathbb{Z} \). A homomorphism can map one of the non-identity elements of \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) to a non-identity element in \( \mathbb{Z} \). Therefore, this statement is also **False**.

Combining the evaluations, we find that both statements are false.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the values of \( c \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) such that \( \mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) \) is a field, we need to check when the polynomial \( x^3 + x^2 + c \) is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

1. **Identify the elements of \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)**: The elements are \( 0, 1, 2 \).

2. **Check irreducibility for each \( c \)**:
   - For \( c = 0 \): The polynomial becomes \( x^3 + x^2 \). This can be factored as \( x^2(x + 1) \), which is reducible.
   - For \( c = 1 \): The polynomial becomes \( x^3 + x^2 + 1 \). We check for roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \):
     - \( f(0) = 0^3 + 0^2 + 1 = 1 \) (not a root)
     - \( f(1) = 1^3 + 1^2 + 1 = 3 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \) (is a root)
     - \( f(2) = 2^3 + 2^2 + 1 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 \equiv 1 \mod 3 \) (not a root)
     Since \( f(1) = 0 \), the polynomial is reducible.
   - For \( c = 2 \): The polynomial becomes \( x^3 + x^2 + 2 \). We check for roots:
     - \( f(0) = 0^3 + 0^2 + 2 = 2 \) (not a root)
     - \( f(1) = 1^3 + 1^2 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 \equiv 1 \mod 3 \) (not a root)
     - \( f(2) = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 \equiv 2 \mod 3 \) (not a root)
     Since there are no roots, \( x^3 + x^2 + 2 \) is irreducible.

3. **Conclusion**: The only value of \( c \) that makes \( \mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) \) a field is \( c = 2 \).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To evaluate the truth of the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: If R is an integral domain, then R[x] is an integral domain.
1. An integral domain is a commutative ring with no zero divisors and has a multiplicative identity.
2. The polynomial ring R[x] consists of polynomials with coefficients in R. If R has no zero divisors, then the product of any two non-zero polynomials in R[x] will also be non-zero.
3. Therefore, R[x] inherits the property of being an integral domain from R.

Thus, Statement 1 is **True**.

**Statement 2**: If R is a ring and f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then deg(f(x)g(x)) = deg(f(x)) + deg(g(x)).
1. The degree of a polynomial is defined as the highest power of x with a non-zero coefficient.
2. When multiplying two polynomials, the degree of the product is the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials, provided that neither polynomial is the zero polynomial.
3. However, if either f(x) or g(x) is the zero polynomial, then deg(f(x)g(x)) is not defined in the same way, as the degree of the zero polynomial is typically considered to be negative infinity.

Thus, Statement 2 is **False** because it does not hold in the case where one of the polynomials is zero.

Combining the evaluations, we have:
- Statement 1: True
- Statement 2: False

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To find the maximum possible order of an element in the group \( \mathbb{Z}_8 \times \mathbb{Z}_{10} \times \mathbb{Z}_{24} \), we first need to determine the orders of the individual groups.

1. The order of an element in \( \mathbb{Z}_n \) is given by \( n \) divided by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( n \) and the element. The maximum order of an element in \( \mathbb{Z}_n \) is \( n \) itself. Therefore:
   - The maximum order in \( \mathbb{Z}_8 \) is 8.
   - The maximum order in \( \mathbb{Z}_{10} \) is 10.
   - The maximum order in \( \mathbb{Z}_{24} \) is 24.

2. The order of an element in the direct product \( \mathbb{Z}_8 \times \mathbb{Z}_{10} \times \mathbb{Z}_{24} \) is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the individual components. Thus, we need to calculate:
   - \( \text{lcm}(8, 10, 24) \).

3. To find the lcm, we can factor each number into its prime factors:
   - \( 8 = 2^3 \)
   - \( 10 = 2^1 \times 5^1 \)
   - \( 24 = 2^3 \times 3^1 \)

   Now, we take the highest power of each prime:
   - For \( 2 \): the highest power is \( 2^3 \).
   - For \( 3 \): the highest power is \( 3^1 \).
   - For \( 5 \): the highest power is \( 5^1 \).

   Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{lcm}(8, 10, 24) = 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 = 8 \times 3 \times 5 = 120.
   \]

Thus, the maximum possible order for some element of \( \mathbb{Z}_8 \times \mathbb{Z}_{10} \times \mathbb{Z}_{24} \) is 120.

"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

1. **Statement 1: Every solvable group is of prime-power order.**
   - This statement is false. A solvable group can have an order that is not a prime power. For example, the symmetric group \( S_3 \) is solvable and has order 6, which is not a prime power.

2. **Statement 2: Every group of prime-power order is solvable.**
   - This statement is true. By a well-known result in group theory, any group whose order is a power of a prime (i.e., \( p^n \) for some prime \( p \) and integer \( n \geq 0 \)) is solvable.

Combining the evaluations of both statements, we find that Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the values of \( c \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) such that \( \mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1) \) is a field, we need to check when the polynomial \( x^3 + cx^2 + 1 \) is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

1. A polynomial is irreducible over a field if it cannot be factored into polynomials of lower degree with coefficients in that field. For a cubic polynomial, it is irreducible if it has no roots in the field.

2. The field \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) consists of the elements \( \{0, 1, 2\} \). We will check each value of \( c \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) (i.e., \( c = 0, 1, 2 \)) to see if \( x^3 + cx^2 + 1 \) has any roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

3. **For \( c = 0 \)**:
   \[
   x^3 + 1 = 0 \implies x^3 = -1 \equiv 2 \mod 3
   \]
   Testing \( x = 0, 1, 2 \):
   - \( x = 0: 0^3 + 1 = 1 \) (not a root)
   - \( x = 1: 1^3 + 1 = 2 \) (not a root)
   - \( x = 2: 2^3 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \) (is a root)

   Thus, \( x^3 + 1 \) is reducible.

4. **For \( c = 1 \)**:
   \[
   x^3 + x^2 + 1 = 0
   \]
   Testing \( x = 0, 1, 2 \):
   - \( x = 0: 0^3 + 0^2 + 1 = 1 \) (not a root)
   - \( x = 1: 1^3 + 1^2 + 1 = 3 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \) (is a root)
   - \( x = 2: 2^3 + 2^2 + 1 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 \equiv 1 \mod 3 \) (not a root)

5. **For \( c = 2 \)**:
   \[
   x^3 + 2x^2 + 1 = 0
   \]
   Testing \( x = 0, 1, 2 \):
   - \( x = 0: 0^3 + 2 \cdot 0^2 + 1 = 1 \) (not a root)
   - \( x = 1: 1^3 + 2 \cdot 1^2 + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 \equiv 1 \mod 3 \) (not a root)
   - \( x = 2: 2^3 + 2 \cdot 2^2 + 1 = 8 + 8 + 1 = 17 \equiv 2 \mod 3 \) (not a root)

   Thus, \( x^3 + 2x^2 + 1 \) is irreducible.

Since \( x^3 + 2x^2 + 1 \) is irreducible, \( \mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + 2x^2 + 1) \) is a field.

Therefore, the values of \( c \) for which \( \mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1) \) is a field are \( c = 2 \).

2. **Testing Each Element**:
   - For 2: 
     - 2 * 2 ≡ 4 (mod 10)

   - For 4:
     - 4 * 2 ≡ 8 (mod 10)
     - 4 * 4 ≡ 16 ≡ 6 (mod 10)

     - 8 * 6 ≡ 48 ≡ 8 (mod 10) (this works)
     - 8 * 8 ≡ 64 ≡ 4 (mod 10)

3. **Finding the Identity**: 
   - The element that satisfies the identity condition for all elements in G is 6, as it returns the original element when multiplied by itself.

Thus, the identity element in the group G under multiplication modulo 10 is 6.

"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: If G, H, and K are groups of order 4, at least two of them are isomorphic.
- The groups of order 4 can be classified as either the cyclic group \( \mathbb{Z}_4 \) or the Klein four-group \( V_4 \).
- There are only two distinct group structures of order 4: \( \mathbb{Z}_4 \) and \( V_4 \).
- Therefore, if we have three groups of order 4, at least two of them must be isomorphic to either \( \mathbb{Z}_4 \) or \( V_4 \).
- Thus, Statement 1 is **True**.

**Statement 2**: If \( \mathbb{Z}_r + \mathbb{Z}_s \) is isomorphic to a subgroup \( \mathbb{Z}_m + \mathbb{Z}_n \), then \( r \) divides \( m \) and \( s \) divides \( n \).
- The structure of the direct sum \( \mathbb{Z}_r + \mathbb{Z}_s \) is determined by the orders \( r \) and \( s \).
- If \( \mathbb{Z}_r + \mathbb{Z}_s \) is isomorphic to a subgroup of \( \mathbb{Z}_m + \mathbb{Z}_n \), it implies that the orders of the components must relate in a way that respects the divisibility.
- However, it is not necessarily true that \( r \) must divide \( m \) and \( s \) must divide \( n \) for the isomorphism to hold. The subgroup structure can be more complex.
- Therefore, Statement 2 is **False**.

"To find the degree of the field extension \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\), I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the field extension**: The field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\) is formed by adjoining \(\sqrt{2}\) to the field of rational numbers \(\mathbb{Q}\).

2. **Determine the minimal polynomial**: The minimal polynomial of \(\sqrt{2}\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\) is \(x^2 - 2\). This polynomial is irreducible over \(\mathbb{Q}\) because it has no rational roots (as per the Rational Root Theorem).

3. **Calculate the degree**: The degree of the field extension \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\) is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial. The polynomial \(x^2 - 2\) is of degree 2.

**Statement 1**: ""Every free abelian group is torsion free.""
- A free abelian group is one that has a basis such that every element can be expressed as a finite linear combination of the basis elements with integer coefficients. 
- In a free abelian group, there are no elements of finite order (except the identity), meaning that if \( nx = 0 \) for some non-zero integer \( n \), then \( x \) must be the identity. 
- Therefore, every free abelian group is indeed torsion free.

**Statement 2**: ""Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group.""
- This statement is not true in general. A classic counterexample is the group \( \mathbb{Q} \) (the rational numbers), which is finitely generated and torsion-free but not free. 
- A finitely generated torsion-free abelian group can be isomorphic to \( \mathbb{Q}^n \) for some \( n \), which is not a free abelian group in the sense of having a basis of finitely many elements with integer coefficients.

"To find a generator for the finite field \( \mathbb{Z}_{11} \), we need to identify an element \( g \) such that the powers of \( g \) generate all non-zero elements of the field. The non-zero elements of \( \mathbb{Z}_{11} \) are \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \).

1. First, we need to check each candidate from the choices to see if it is a generator. A generator \( g \) must satisfy the condition that \( g^k \mod 11 \) produces all integers from 1 to 10 for \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, 10 \).

2. Let's check each option:

- By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups \(n_3\) must divide 53 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only divisor of 53 that satisfies this is 1, which means there is exactly one Sylow 3-subgroup, and it is normal.
- Similarly, the number of Sylow 53-subgroups \(n_{53}\) must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 53. The only divisor of 3 that satisfies this is also 1, meaning there is exactly one Sylow 53-subgroup, which is also normal.
- Since both Sylow subgroups are normal and their orders are coprime, the group is the direct product of these two normal subgroups, which implies that the group is cyclic.
- Therefore, Statement 1 is **True**.

**Statement 2:** ""Every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.""
- The order 102 can be factored as \(102 = 2 \times 3 \times 17\), where 2, 3, and 17 are all prime numbers.
- By the Sylow theorems, we can analyze the Sylow subgroups:
  - The number of Sylow 2-subgroups \(n_2\) must divide 51 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Possible values are 1, 3, 17, or 51. If \(n_2 = 1\), then the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal.
  - The number of Sylow 3-subgroups \(n_3\) must divide 34 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Possible values are 1, 2, 17, or 34. If \(n_3 = 1\), then the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal.
  - The number of Sylow 17-subgroups \(n_{17}\) must divide 6 and be congruent to 1 modulo 17. The only possibility is 1, which means the Sylow 17-subgroup is normal.
- If any of these Sylow subgroups is normal, then the group has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.
- Therefore, Statement 2 is also **True**.

Combining the evaluations, we find that both statements are true.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To evaluate the truth of the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: If H and K are subgroups of G and one of H or K is a normal subgroup of G, then HK is a subgroup of G.
- A subgroup HK is defined as the set of all products hk where h is in H and k is in K.
- If H is normal in G, then for any g in G and h in H, the element gHg^(-1) is still in H. This property ensures that the product of elements from H and K will still yield elements in HK that are closed under the group operation.
- Similarly, if K is normal in G, the same reasoning applies.
- Therefore, this statement is **True**.

**Statement 2**: All groups of order p^2 where p is prime are Abelian.
- By the classification of groups of small order, any group of order p^2 (where p is a prime) can be shown to be either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p. 
- Both of these structures are Abelian.
- Therefore, this statement is also **True**.

Since both statements are true, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: ""The unity of a subring must be the same as the unity of the ring.""
- A subring is a subset of a ring that is itself a ring with the same operations. However, a subring does not necessarily have to contain the unity (multiplicative identity) of the larger ring. If the subring does have a unity, it can be different from the unity of the ring. Therefore, this statement is **False**.

**Statement 2**: ""Every field is an integral domain.""
- A field is defined as a set equipped with two operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy certain properties, including the existence of multiplicative inverses for all non-zero elements. An integral domain is a commutative ring with no zero divisors and a unity. Since fields do not have zero divisors and are commutative, every field indeed qualifies as an integral domain. Therefore, this statement is **True**.

Combining the evaluations:
- Statement 1 is False.
- Statement 2 is True.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: The set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant is a group under matrix multiplication.

1. **Closure**: The product of two 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries is also a 2 x 2 matrix with integer entries. If both matrices have nonzero determinants, their product will also have a nonzero determinant (since the determinant of a product is the product of the determinants).
2. **Associativity**: Matrix multiplication is associative.
3. **Identity Element**: The identity matrix (which is a 2 x 2 matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere) is included in this set, and it has a determinant of 1 (nonzero).
4. **Inverses**: Not all matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinants have integer inverses. For example, the matrix [[1, 1], [0, 1]] has a nonzero determinant but its inverse is not an integer matrix.

Since the set does not satisfy the requirement for inverses, Statement 1 is **False**.

**Statement 2**: The set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 is a group under matrix multiplication.

1. **Closure**: The product of two matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 also has integer entries and a determinant of 1.
2. **Associativity**: Matrix multiplication is associative.
3. **Identity Element**: The identity matrix is included in this set and has a determinant of 1.
4. **Inverses**: The inverse of a matrix with determinant 1 is also a matrix with integer entries and determinant 1 (specifically, the inverse exists and is also an integer matrix).

Since all group properties are satisfied, Statement 2 is **True**.

"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: ""Every quotient ring of every commutative ring is again a commutative ring.""
- A quotient ring is formed by taking a commutative ring R and an ideal I of R, and then considering the set of equivalence classes R/I. 
- The operations of addition and multiplication in the quotient ring R/I are defined in such a way that they respect the commutative properties of R. 
- Therefore, since the operations in the quotient ring are derived from those in R, and R is commutative, the quotient ring R/I is also commutative.

**Conclusion for Statement 1**: True.

**Statement 2**: ""An ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 is all of R if and only if 1 in N.""
- If N is an ideal of R and contains the unity element 1, then for any element r in R, we can express r as r * 1, which means r is in N (since ideals are closed under multiplication by ring elements). Thus, N must be all of R.
- Conversely, if N is all of R, then it trivially contains 1, since 1 is an element of R.

**Conclusion for Statement 2**: True.

Putting it all together, both statements are true.

"To analyze the relation ~ on the set A = (1, 2, 3, 4) with the pairs {(1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 2)}, I will evaluate each property step by step.

1. **Reflexive**: A relation is reflexive if every element is related to itself. In this case, we need (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 4) to be in ~. Since none of these pairs are present in the relation, ~ is not reflexive.

2. **Symmetric**: A relation is symmetric if for every (a, b) in ~, the pair (b, a) is also in ~. Here, we have (1, 2) and (1, 3) in ~, but (2, 1) and (3, 1) are not present. Therefore, ~ is not symmetric.

3. **Anti-symmetric**: A relation is anti-symmetric if for every (a, b) and (b, a) in ~, it must be that a = b. In this case, we do not have any pairs (b, a) for the pairs we have, so we cannot conclude that it is anti-symmetric based on the given pairs. However, since there are no pairs that violate the condition, we can say it is anti-symmetric.

4. **Transitive**: A relation is transitive if whenever (a, b) and (b, c) are in ~, then (a, c) must also be in ~. We have (1, 2) and (1, 3), but there are no pairs that would allow us to check transitivity. Since we cannot find a violation, we can say it is transitive.

Based on the evaluations:
- ~ is not reflexive.
- ~ is not symmetric.
- ~ is anti-symmetric.
- ~ is transitive.

The only option that fits is that ~ is not anti-symmetric.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine how many homomorphisms there are from the group \( \mathbb{Z} \) (the integers under addition) into \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) (the integers modulo 2 under addition), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the structure of the groups**: The group \( \mathbb{Z} \) is generated by the element 1, meaning any homomorphism from \( \mathbb{Z} \) is completely determined by where it sends the generator 1. The group \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) has two elements: 0 and 1.

2. **Determine possible images**: A homomorphism \( f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_2 \) must satisfy the property that \( f(n) = n \cdot f(1) \) for any integer \( n \). The image of \( f(1) \) can either be 0 or 1.

3. **Check the properties of homomorphisms**: If \( f(1) = 0 \), then for any integer \( n \), \( f(n) = n \cdot 0 = 0 \). This gives us one homomorphism, the trivial homomorphism. If \( f(1) = 1 \), then for even \( n \), \( f(n) = 0 \) and for odd \( n \), \( f(n) = 1 \). This is also a valid homomorphism.

Thus, there are exactly two distinct homomorphisms from \( \mathbb{Z} \) to \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \): one that sends every integer to 0 and one that sends even integers to 0 and odd integers to 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

   - A ring is a set equipped with two operations (addition and multiplication) where addition is associative and commutative, multiplication is associative, and multiplication distributes over addition. A ring does not necessarily require a multiplicative identity or inverses.
   - Since every field satisfies the properties of a ring, this statement is **True**.

2. **Statement 2: Every ring has a multiplicative identity.**
   - A ring may or may not have a multiplicative identity. A ring that does have a multiplicative identity is called a ""unital ring"" or ""ring with unity."" However, there are rings that do not have a multiplicative identity.

**Statement 1**: ""If R is a ring and f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then deg (f(x)+g(x)) = maximum (deg f(x), deg g(x)).""
1. The degree of a polynomial is defined as the highest power of x with a non-zero coefficient.
2. When adding two polynomials, the degree of the sum can be less than the maximum degree of the two polynomials if the leading coefficients cancel each other out.
3. Therefore, this statement is false because the degree of the sum can be less than the maximum degree of the individual polynomials.

**Statement 2**: ""If F is a field then every ideal of F[x] is principal.""
1. A field is a commutative ring with unity where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.
2. In the polynomial ring F[x] over a field F, every ideal is generated by a single polynomial (principal ideal).
3. This is a well-known result in ring theory, so this statement is true.

"To determine the conditions under which a subset H of a group (G,*) is itself a group, we can analyze the options provided step by step.

1. **Closure under the group operation**: For H to be a group, it must be closed under the operation of G. This means that if a and b are in H, then the result of the operation a * b must also be in H. This corresponds to option a).

2. **Existence of inverses**: For every element a in H, there must exist an inverse element a^-1 in H such that a * a^-1 = e, where e is the identity element of G. This corresponds to option b).

3. **Identity element**: H must contain the identity element of the group G. This is crucial because the identity element is necessary for the group structure. This corresponds to option d).

Now, let's evaluate the options:
- Option a) is necessary for closure.
- Option b) is necessary for the existence of inverses.
- Option d) is necessary for the identity element.

Option c) states that if a and b are in H, then a * b^-1 must also be in H. While this condition is related to the existence of inverses, it is not one of the primary group axioms. If options a), b), and d) are satisfied, then option c) will also be satisfied.

Thus, the essential conditions for H to be a group are options a), b), and d). However, since the question asks for a single choice that is necessary for H to be a group, the most fundamental one is option a).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To factor the polynomial \( x^4 + 4 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5[x] \), we first rewrite \( 4 \) as \( -1 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). Thus, we have:

\[
x^4 + 4 \equiv x^4 - 1 \mod 5
\]

Next, we can factor \( x^4 - 1 \) using the difference of squares:

\[
x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)
\]

Now, we can further factor \( x^2 - 1 \):

\[
x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)
\]

Next, we need to factor \( x^2 + 1 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \). We can check for roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \):

- For \( x = 0 \): \( 0^2 + 1 = 1 \) (not a root)
- For \( x = 1 \): \( 1^2 + 1 = 2 \) (not a root)
- For \( x = 2 \): \( 2^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 \equiv 0 \) (is a root)
- For \( x = 3 \): \( 3^2 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10 \equiv 0 \) (is a root)
- For \( x = 4 \): \( 4^2 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 \equiv 2 \) (not a root)

Since \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \) are roots, we can factor \( x^2 + 1 \) as:

\[
x^2 + 1 = (x - 2)(x - 3)
\]

Putting it all together, we have:

\[
x^4 + 4 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)
\]

Now, we can match this factorization with the provided choices. The roots \( 2 \) and \( 3 \) correspond to \( -2 \) and \( -3 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), which are \( 3 \) and \( 2 \) respectively. Thus, the factorization can be expressed as:

\[
(x - 1)(x + 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)

This matches with the choice:

a) \( (x - 2)(x + 2)(x - 1)(x + 1) \)

- A free abelian group of rank \( n \) can be constructed as \( \mathbb{Z}^n \), which is the direct sum of \( n \) copies of the integers \( \mathbb{Z} \). 
- Since \( n \) can be any positive integer, it is indeed true that for every positive integer rank, there exists a free abelian group.

**Statement 2**: ""A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set.""
- The Betti number of a finitely generated abelian group corresponds to the rank of the group, which is the maximum number of linearly independent elements. 
- However, a finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if and only if it has no torsion elements. The condition given (Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set) does not guarantee that the group is free; it could still have torsion elements.
- Therefore, this statement is false.

Combining the evaluations:
- Statement 1 is true.
- Statement 2 is false.

"To find the inverse of an element \( a \) in the group \( (Z, *) \) where the operation is defined as \( a * b = a + b + 1 \), we need to find an element \( b \) such that \( a * b = e \), where \( e \) is the identity element of the group.

1. **Identify the identity element**: We need to find \( e \) such that for any \( a \in Z \), \( a * e = a \). Using the operation, we have:
   \[
   a * e = a + e + 1 = a
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   e + 1 = 0 \implies e = -1
   \]
   So, the identity element \( e \) is \( -1 \).

2. **Find the inverse**: We need to find \( b \) such that:
   \[
   a * b = -1
   \]
   Using the operation:
   \[
   a * b = a + b + 1 = -1
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   a + b + 1 = -1 \implies b = -1 - a - 1 = -a - 2
   \]
   Thus, the inverse of \( a \) is \( -a - 2 \).

3. **Express the inverse**: The expression \( -a - 2 \) can be rewritten as \( -(a + 2) \), which corresponds to \( a - 2 \) when considering the choices given.

Now, let's compare this with the options provided:
- a) 0
- b) -2
- c) a-2
- d) (2+a)*-1

The correct expression for the inverse we derived is \( -a - 2 \), which matches option c) \( a - 2 \).

"To find the degree of the field extension \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}\sqrt{3})\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Simplify the expression**: We can rewrite \(\sqrt{2}\sqrt{3}\) as \(\sqrt{6}\). Therefore, we are looking for the degree of the field extension \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\).

2. **Determine the minimal polynomial**: The minimal polynomial of \(\sqrt{6}\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\) is \(x^2 - 6\). This polynomial is irreducible over \(\mathbb{Q}\) because 6 is not a perfect square in \(\mathbb{Q}\).

3. **Calculate the degree**: The degree of the field extension is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial. The polynomial \(x^2 - 6\) is of degree 2.

Thus, the degree of the field extension \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}\sqrt{3})\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\) is 2.

"First, I will apply Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if \( p \) is a prime number and \( a \) is an integer not divisible by \( p \), then \( a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p \).

In this case, \( a = 3 \) and \( p = 23 \). Since 3 is not divisible by 23, we can use the theorem. According to Fermat's theorem:

\[
3^{22} \equiv 1 \mod 23
\]

Next, I need to express \( 3^{47} \) in terms of \( 3^{22} \). I can do this by finding the exponent modulo 22:

\[
47 \mod 22 = 3
\]

This means:

\[
3^{47} \equiv 3^3 \mod 23
\]

Now, I will calculate \( 3^3 \):

\[
3^3 = 27
\]

Next, I need to find the remainder of 27 when divided by 23:

\[
27 \mod 23 = 4

Thus, the remainder of \( 3^{47} \) when divided by 23 is 4. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To find the characteristic of the ring \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \), I will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the definition of characteristic**: The characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( n \cdot 1 = 0 \) in the ring, where \( 1 \) is the multiplicative identity of the ring.

2. **Identify the elements of the ring**: The ring \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) consists of the elements \( \{0, 1, 2\} \). Therefore, the ring \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \) consists of the pairs \( (a, b) \) where \( a, b \in \mathbb{Z}_3 \). The elements of this ring are \( (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) \).

3. **Calculate the characteristic**: In \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), we have \( 3 \cdot 1 = 3 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \). Therefore, in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \), we have:
   \[
   3 \cdot (1, 1) = (3 \cdot 1, 3 \cdot 1) = (0, 0)
   \]
   This shows that \( 3 \) is the smallest positive integer such that \( n \cdot 1 = 0 \) in the ring \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Thus, the characteristic of the ring \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is \( 3 \).

"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: ""If a and b are elements of a group and a is not equal to b, then a^2 is not equal to b^2.""
- This statement is generally false. For example, in the group of integers under addition, let a = 1 and b = -1. Here, a ≠ b, but a^2 = 1^2 = 1 and b^2 = (-1)^2 = 1, so a^2 = b^2. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.

**Statement 2**: ""The set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup.""
- The dihedral group D_n consists of rotations and reflections. The rotations alone do indeed form a cyclic subgroup, as they can be generated by a single rotation (the rotation by 360/n degrees). Therefore, Statement 2 is true.

Now, combining the evaluations:
- Statement 1 is False.
- Statement 2 is True.

"To evaluate the truth of the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1:** In a group, \((ab)^{-2} = b^{-2}a^{-2}\).

1. The left-hand side \((ab)^{-2}\) can be rewritten using the property of inverses: \((ab)^{-2} = (ab)^{-1}(ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1}\).
2. The right-hand side \(b^{-2}a^{-2}\) can be rewritten as \(b^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1}a^{-1}\).
3. In general, the order of multiplication matters in groups, so \(b^{-1}a^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1} \neq b^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1}a^{-1}\).
4. Therefore, Statement 1 is **False**.

**Statement 2:** In a group, \((ab)^n = a^nb^n\).

1. For \(n = 2\), \((ab)^2 = ab \cdot ab = a(ba)b\). This is not equal to \(a^2b^2\) unless \(a\) and \(b\) commute (i.e., \(ab = ba\)).
2. For \(n = 3\), \((ab)^3 = (ab)(ab)(ab) = a(ba)(ab)\), which again does not equal \(a^3b^3\) in general.
3. Thus, Statement 2 is also **False**.

"To evaluate the truth of the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: ""S_n is non-Abelian for all n >= 3.""
- The symmetric group S_n consists of all permutations of n elements. For n = 3, S_3 is non-Abelian because there exist permutations that do not commute. For example, the transpositions (1 2) and (1 3) do not commute: (1 2)(1 3) ≠ (1 3)(1 2). This property holds for all n >= 3, as larger symmetric groups also contain non-commuting elements. Therefore, Statement 1 is **True**.

**Statement 2**: ""If a is a permutation that is an m-cycle and b is a permutation that is an n-cycle, then |ab| = lcm(m,n).""
- This statement is generally **False**. The order of the product of two permutations is not simply the least common multiple of their individual orders unless they are disjoint cycles. If the cycles share elements, the order of the product can be less than lcm(m,n). For example, if a = (1 2) and b = (2 3), then |ab| is not equal to lcm(2, 2) = 2, but rather it is 3, since the product results in a 3-cycle.

Based on this analysis:
- Statement 1 is True.
- Statement 2 is False.

"To find the characteristic of the ring \( \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \), we need to understand what the characteristic of a ring is. The characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( n \cdot 1 = 0 \) in the ring, where \( 1 \) is the multiplicative identity of the ring.

1. In the ring \( \mathbb{Z} \), the characteristic is 0 because there is no positive integer \( n \) such that \( n \cdot 1 = 0 \) (the integers do not have a finite characteristic).
2. The ring \( \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \) consists of ordered pairs of integers, and the identity element in this ring is \( (1, 1) \).
3. To find the characteristic of \( \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \), we consider \( n \cdot (1, 1) = (n \cdot 1, n \cdot 1) = (n, n) \). This will equal \( (0, 0) \) if and only if \( n = 0 \) in both components, which means \( n \) must be 0.

Since there is no positive integer \( n \) such that \( n \cdot (1, 1) = (0, 0) \), the characteristic of the ring \( \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \) is also 0.

1. A set forms a group under a binary operation if it satisfies four properties: closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility.
2. The set {1, 2, ..., n-1} under multiplication modulo n is not guaranteed to be a group for all n > 1. Specifically, it is a group if and only if n is prime. If n is composite, there will be elements in the set that do not have multiplicative inverses modulo n.
3. Therefore, Statement 1 is **False**.

**Statement 2**: There is an integer x such that 63x mod 100 = 1.

1. This statement is asking if 63 has a multiplicative inverse modulo 100. For an integer to have a multiplicative inverse modulo n, it must be coprime to n (i.e., gcd(63, 100) must be 1).
2. The prime factorization of 63 is 3^2 * 7, and for 100, it is 2^2 * 5^2. The gcd(63, 100) is 1, meaning they are coprime.
3. Since 63 and 100 are coprime, there exists an integer x such that 63x mod 100 = 1. Therefore, Statement 2 is **True**.

1. **Statement 1**: ""If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then K is free abelian.""
   - A finitely generated free abelian group is isomorphic to \(\mathbb{Z}^n\) for some integer \(n\). Any subgroup of a free abelian group is also free abelian. Therefore, if \(K\) is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, it must also be free abelian. This statement is **True**.

2. **Statement 2**: ""If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then G / K is free abelian.""
   - While \(K\) is free abelian, the quotient group \(G/K\) is not guaranteed to be free abelian. For example, if \(G\) is \(\mathbb{Z}^2\) and \(K\) is a subgroup generated by a single element, the quotient \(G/K\) can be isomorphic to \(\mathbb{Z}\) or \(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\) for some \(n\), which is not free abelian. Thus, this statement is **False**.

Combining the evaluations of both statements, we find that Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is False.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: The external direct product of cyclic groups is cyclic.
- The external direct product of two cyclic groups \( \mathbb{Z}_m \) and \( \mathbb{Z}_n \) is cyclic if and only if \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). If \( m \) and \( n \) are not coprime, the direct product \( \mathbb{Z}_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n \) is not cyclic. Therefore, this statement is not universally true.

**Statement 2**: The external direct product of \( D_3 \) and \( D_4 \) is isomorphic to \( D_{12} \).
- The dihedral group \( D_n \) has order \( 2n \). Thus, \( D_3 \) has order 6 and \( D_4 \) has order 8. The order of the external direct product \( D_3 \times D_4 \) is \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \). On the other hand, \( D_{12} \) has order 12. Since \( D_3 \times D_4 \) has a different order than \( D_{12} \), they cannot be isomorphic. Therefore, this statement is false.

Combining the evaluations:
- Statement 1 is False.
- Statement 2 is False.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To analyze the statements, let's break them down step by step.

1. **Statement 1**: ""Every nonzero free abelian group has an infinite number of bases.""
   - A free abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of the integers, \(\mathbb{Z}^n\), where \(n\) is the rank of the group. For any nonzero free abelian group, if it has rank \(n\), it has a basis consisting of \(n\) elements. 
   - For any basis, we can generate infinitely many other bases by taking linear combinations of the basis elements with integer coefficients. Therefore, this statement is true.

2. **Statement 2**: ""Every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases.""
   - A free abelian group of rank at least 2 can be represented as \(\mathbb{Z}^n\) for \(n \geq 2\). Similar to the reasoning in Statement 1, we can form infinitely many bases from any given basis by taking linear combinations. Thus, this statement is also true.

Since both statements are true, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: ""For every positive integer n there is a cyclic group of order n.""
- A cyclic group of order n can be constructed using the integers modulo n, denoted as \( \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} \). This group is generated by the element 1, and it contains n elements. Therefore, this statement is true.

**Statement 2**: ""Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group.""
- Let G be a finite cyclic group of order n. By the properties of cyclic groups, for each divisor d of n, there exists an element in G whose order is exactly d. This is a consequence of the structure theorem for finite abelian groups and the properties of generators. Therefore, this statement is also true.

Since both statements are true, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: If a group has an element of order 10, then it has elements of orders 1, 2, and 5.
- An element of order 10 generates a cyclic subgroup of order 10. By Lagrange's theorem, the orders of elements in this subgroup must divide the order of the group. The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. Therefore, the subgroup generated by the element of order 10 must contain elements of orders 1 (the identity), 2, and 5. Thus, Statement 1 is true.

**Statement 2**: If a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it has an element of order 6.
- This statement is related to the existence of elements of coprime orders. If a group has elements of orders 2 and 3, and these orders are coprime, then by the properties of groups, there exists an element of order equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of the two orders. The LCM of 2 and 3 is 6. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true.

Based on the analysis, both statements are true. 

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To analyze the statements, let's break down the implications of the given condition \( g(f(a)) = a \) for all \( a \in A \).

1. **Understanding the condition**: The condition \( g(f(a)) = a \) means that for every element \( a \) in set \( A \), applying function \( f \) to \( a \) gives an element in set \( B \), and then applying function \( g \) to that result brings us back to the original element \( a \). This indicates that \( g \) is able to recover every element of \( A \) from the image of \( f \).

2. **Injectivity of g**: To determine if \( g \) is injective, we need to check if \( g(x_1) = g(x_2) \) implies \( x_1 = x_2 \). Suppose \( f(a_1) = f(a_2) \) for some \( a_1, a_2 \in A \). Then applying \( g \) gives \( g(f(a_1)) = g(f(a_2)) \), which leads to \( a_1 = a_2 \) due to the condition \( g(f(a)) = a \). This shows that \( g \) is injective.

3. **Surjectivity of g**: For \( g \) to be surjective, every element in \( A \) must be the image of some element in \( B \) under \( g \). The condition \( g(f(a)) = a \) does not guarantee that every element in \( A \) can be reached by applying \( g \) to some element in \( B \). It only guarantees that the elements in the image of \( f \) are mapped back to \( A \). Therefore, \( g \) is not necessarily surjective.

Based on this analysis, we conclude:
- Statement 1 is True (g is injective).
- Statement 2 is False (g is not necessarily surjective).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: A homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel consists of the identity element alone.
- A homomorphism \( f: G \to H \) is one-to-one (injective) if and only if the kernel of \( f \) is trivial, meaning it contains only the identity element of \( G \). This is a standard result in group theory. Therefore, Statement 1 is **True**.

**Statement 2**: The image of a group of 6 elements under some homomorphism may have 4 elements.
- By the First Isomorphism Theorem, the image of a group under a homomorphism has a size that is equal to the order of the group divided by the order of the kernel. If we have a group of order 6 and the kernel has order 2 (which is possible), then the image would have order \( 6 / 2 = 3 \). However, it cannot have 4 elements because the order of the image must divide the order of the original group (6). Therefore, Statement 2 is **False**.

Combining the evaluations, we have:
- Statement 1: True
- Statement 2: False

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To evaluate the truth of the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: If H and K are subgroups of a group G, then |HK| = |H||K|/|H ∩ K|.

1. This statement is a well-known result in group theory regarding the product of two subgroups. The formula states that the order of the product of two subgroups H and K is equal to the product of their orders divided by the order of their intersection.
2. This is true because the elements of HK can be represented as products of elements from H and K, and the intersection accounts for the overcounting of elements that are in both H and K.
3. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.

**Statement 2**: A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.

1. By the Sylow theorems, we can analyze the structure of groups of order 2p. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide p and be congruent to 1 modulo 2, which means there is either one or p Sylow 2-subgroups.
2. If there is one Sylow 2-subgroup, it is normal, and the group is cyclic. If there are p Sylow 2-subgroups, the group is not cyclic and is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p.
3. Thus, Statement 2 is also true.

Since both statements are true, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To find T(-3, 2), I will first express T(x, y) in terms of T(1, 0) and T(0, 1).

1. We know that T(1, 0) = 3 and T(0, 1) = -5. A common way to express T(x, y) is to use linear combinations of these values. Thus, we can assume T(x, y) = a * T(1, 0) + b * T(0, 1) for some coefficients a and b.

2. For T(-3, 2), we can express it as:
   T(-3, 2) = T(-3 * 1 + 2 * 0, -3 * 0 + 2 * 1) = -3 * T(1, 0) + 2 * T(0, 1).

3. Substituting the known values:
   T(-3, 2) = -3 * 3 + 2 * (-5) = -9 - 10 = -19.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to compute the product of 12 and 16. 

Step 1: Calculate the product: 
12 * 16 = 192.

Step 2: Now, I need to find the result of 192 in the ring Z_24. This means I need to compute 192 modulo 24. 

Step 3: To find 192 modulo 24, I divide 192 by 24 and find the remainder:
192 ÷ 24 = 8 with a remainder of 0.

Thus, 192 mod 24 = 0.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

1. **Statement 1**: ""Every permutation is a one-to-one function.""
   - A permutation is a rearrangement of elements in a set. By definition, a permutation takes each element of the set and maps it to a unique element in the set, ensuring that no two elements map to the same element. Therefore, every permutation is indeed a one-to-one function.
   - This statement is **True**.

2. **Statement 2**: ""Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one.""
   - A function is a permutation if it is a bijection (both one-to-one and onto) from a set to itself. While it is true that if a function is a permutation, it must be one-to-one, the converse is not true: not every one-to-one function is a permutation, as it may not cover the entire set (not onto). Therefore, this statement is **False**.

Combining the evaluations of both statements, we have:
- Statement 1: True
- Statement 2: False

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To evaluate the truth of the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: ""If a finite group has order n then the group contains a subgroup of order d for every positive divisor d of n.""
- This statement is a consequence of the Sylow theorems and Lagrange's theorem. Lagrange's theorem states that the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group. The existence of subgroups of every order that divides the group order is guaranteed by the Sylow theorems. Therefore, this statement is **True**.

**Statement 2**: ""If a belongs to a finite group then |a| divides |G|.""
- Here, |a| denotes the order of the element a, and |G| denotes the order of the group G. According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in a finite group divides the order of the group. Thus, this statement is also **True**.

Since both statements are true, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To find all cosets of the subgroup \( 4\mathbb{Z} \) in \( 2\mathbb{Z} \), we start by understanding the structure of these groups.

1. **Identify the subgroup and the group**: The subgroup \( 4\mathbb{Z} \) consists of all integer multiples of 4, i.e., \( \{ ..., -8, -4, 0, 4, 8, ... \} \). The group \( 2\mathbb{Z} \) consists of all integer multiples of 2, i.e., \( \{ ..., -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, ... \} \).

2. **Determine the cosets**: A coset of \( 4\mathbb{Z} \) in \( 2\mathbb{Z} \) can be formed by taking an element \( a \in 2\mathbb{Z} \) and adding it to every element of \( 4\mathbb{Z} \). The cosets can be represented as \( a + 4\mathbb{Z} \).

3. **Find distinct cosets**: The elements of \( 2\mathbb{Z} \) can be expressed as \( 2k \) for integers \( k \). The possible cosets are:
   - For \( a = 0 \): \( 0 + 4\mathbb{Z} = 4\mathbb{Z} \)
   - For \( a = 2 \): \( 2 + 4\mathbb{Z} = \{ ..., -6, -2, 2, 6, ... \} \)

   Since \( 2 + 4\mathbb{Z} \) contains all elements of \( 2\mathbb{Z} \) that are not in \( 4\mathbb{Z} \), we conclude that the distinct cosets of \( 4\mathbb{Z} \) in \( 2\mathbb{Z} \) are \( 4\mathbb{Z} \) and \( 2 + 4\mathbb{Z} \).

Thus, the answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which statement is true, let's analyze each option step by step:

a) Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.
- An equivalence relation is defined by three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. A partial-ordering relation, on the other hand, requires reflexivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity. Since equivalence relations are not required to be antisymmetric, this statement is false.

b) Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B = (1, 2) is 64.
- The number of relations from set A to set B is given by the formula |B|^|A|, where |A| is the number of elements in set A and |B| is the number of elements in set B. Here, |A| = 3 (elements x, y, z) and |B| = 2 (elements 1, 2). Therefore, the number of relations is 2^3 = 8, not 64. This statement is false.

c) Empty relation _ is reflexive.
- A relation is reflexive if every element in the set is related to itself. The empty relation does not relate any elements, so it cannot be reflexive. This statement is false.

d) Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.
- A relation is symmetric if for every (a, b) in the relation, (b, a) is also in the relation. A relation is unsymmetric if there exists at least one (a, b) such that (b, a) is not in the relation. This means that being symmetric and being unsymmetric are indeed opposite properties. This statement is true.

After analyzing all the statements, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To find the maximum possible order of an element in the symmetric group \( S_n \) for \( n = 6 \), we need to consider the cycle structure of permutations.

1. The order of a permutation in \( S_n \) is determined by the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of its disjoint cycles. Therefore, we need to find the cycle types that can be formed with 6 elements and calculate their LCM.

2. The possible cycle types for \( n = 6 \) include:
   - One 6-cycle: \( (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) \) → LCM = 6
   - One 5-cycle and one 1-cycle: \( (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)(6) \) → LCM = 5
   - One 4-cycle and one 2-cycle: \( (1, 2, 3, 4)(5, 6) \) → LCM = 4
   - One 3-cycle and one 3-cycle: \( (1, 2, 3)(4, 5, 6) \) → LCM = 3
   - One 3-cycle and one 2-cycle and one 1-cycle: \( (1, 2, 3)(4, 5)(6) \) → LCM = 6
   - One 2-cycle and one 2-cycle and one 2-cycle: \( (1, 2)(3, 4)(5, 6) \) → LCM = 2
   - One 1-cycle and one 1-cycle and one 1-cycle and one 1-cycle and one 1-cycle and one 1-cycle: \( (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6) \) → LCM = 1

3. The maximum LCM from the above combinations is from the cycle type of one 3-cycle and one 3-cycle, which gives us \( LCM(3, 3) = 3 \), and from the cycle type of one 2-cycle and one 2-cycle and one 2-cycle, which gives us \( LCM(2, 2, 2) = 2 \). However, we also have the combination of one 2-cycle and one 4-cycle, which gives us \( LCM(4, 2) = 4 \).

4. The maximum order is actually achieved with the combination of one 3-cycle and one 2-cycle, which gives us \( LCM(3, 2) = 6 \).

5. However, the maximum order can also be achieved with a combination of a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, which gives us \( LCM(3, 2) = 6 \).

6. The maximum order of an element in \( S_6 \) is actually \( 6 \) from the cycle type of one 3-cycle and one 2-cycle.

7. The maximum order can also be achieved with a combination of a 5-cycle and a 1-cycle, which gives us \( LCM(5, 1) = 5 \).

8. The maximum order can also be achieved with a combination of a 4-cycle and a 2-cycle, which gives us \( LCM(4, 2) = 4 \).

9. The maximum order can also be achieved with a combination of a 3-cycle and a 3-cycle, which gives us \( LCM(3, 3) = 3 \).

10. The maximum order can also be achieved with a combination of a 2-cycle and a 2-cycle and a 2-cycle, which gives us \( LCM(2, 2, 2) = 2 \).

11. The maximum order can also be achieved with a combination of a 1-cycle and a 1-cycle and a 1-cycle and a 1-cycle and a 1-cycle and a 1-cycle, which gives us \( LCM(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) = 1 \).

12. The maximum order can also be achieved with a combination of a 6-cycle, which gives us \( LCM(6) = 6 \).

After considering all possible combinations, the maximum order of an element in \( S_6 \) is \( 6 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: ""Q is an extension field of Z_2.""
- The field Z_2 consists of the elements {0, 1} with addition and multiplication defined modulo 2. 
- The field Q consists of all rational numbers, which is a much larger field than Z_2. 
- However, Q is not an extension field of Z_2 because Z_2 is a finite field and Q is an infinite field. An extension field must contain the base field as a subfield, which is not the case here.
- Therefore, Statement 1 is **False**.

**Statement 2**: ""Every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field.""
- This statement is a well-known result in field theory. It states that for any non-constant polynomial with coefficients in a field, there exists an extension field in which the polynomial has at least one root.
- This is true because we can always find a suitable extension field (like the algebraic closure) where the polynomial can be factored, thus guaranteeing at least one root.
- Therefore, Statement 2 is **True**.

Combining the evaluations:
- Statement 1 is False.
- Statement 2 is True.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

**Statement 1**: ""If H is a subgroup of G and a belongs to G then aH is a subgroup of G if and only if a is in H.""
- If \( a \in H \), then \( aH = H \), which is a subgroup of \( G \).
- Conversely, if \( aH \) is a subgroup of \( G \), then it must contain the identity element of \( G \). Since \( H \) is a subgroup, the identity element is in \( H \). For \( aH \) to be a subgroup, it must also contain \( a \) and all products of elements in \( aH \) must also be in \( aH \). This implies that \( a \) must be in \( H \) for \( aH \) to be a subgroup.
- Therefore, Statement 1 is **True**.

**Statement 2**: ""If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G then aH = bH if and only if ab is in H.""
- If \( aH = bH \), then \( b^{-1}a \in H \) (since \( bH = aH \) implies \( b^{-1}aH = H \)). This means \( ab^{-1} \in H \), which does not necessarily imply that \( ab \in H \).
- Conversely, if \( ab \in H \), it does not guarantee that \( aH = bH \). For example, if \( a \) and \( b \) are not in the same coset of \( H \), \( aH \) and \( bH \) can be different even if \( ab \in H \).
- Therefore, Statement 2 is **False**.

Combining the evaluations, we have:
- Statement 1: True
- Statement 2: False

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the polynomial \( x^2 + 1 \) in the finite field \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \), which consists of the elements {0, 1}.

Next, I will substitute each element of \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) into the polynomial to find the zeros:

1. For \( x = 0 \):
   \[
   0^2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 \quad (\text{not a zero})
   \]

2. For \( x = 1 \):
   \[
   1^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 0 \quad (\text{is a zero})
   \]

Now, I have found that \( x = 1 \) is a zero of the polynomial. Since \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) only contains the elements 0 and 1, I can conclude that the only zero of the polynomial \( x^2 + 1 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) is 1.

Thus, the zeros of the polynomial \( x^2 + 1 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) are {1}.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To find the number of elements in the cyclic subgroup of \( \mathbb{Z}_{30} \) generated by 25, we first need to determine the order of the element 25 in \( \mathbb{Z}_{30} \).

1. The order of an element \( a \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_n \) is given by \( \frac{n}{\gcd(a, n)} \). Here, \( n = 30 \) and \( a = 25 \).
2. We need to calculate \( \gcd(25, 30) \). The prime factorization of 25 is \( 5^2 \) and for 30 it is \( 2 \times 3 \times 5 \). The common factor is 5, so \( \gcd(25, 30) = 5 \).
3. Now, we can find the order of 25: 
   \[
   \text{Order} = \frac{30}{\gcd(25, 30)} = \frac{30}{5} = 6.
   \]

Thus, the number of elements in the cyclic subgroup generated by 25 in \( \mathbb{Z}_{30} \) is 6.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To find the order of the element (4, 2) in the group \( \mathbb{Z}_{12} \times \mathbb{Z}_{8} \), I will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the order of each component**: 
   - The order of an element \( a \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_n \) is given by \( \frac{n}{\text{gcd}(a, n)} \).
   - For the first component, 4 in \( \mathbb{Z}_{12} \):
     - \( \text{gcd}(4, 12) = 4 \)
     - Therefore, the order of 4 in \( \mathbb{Z}_{12} \) is \( \frac{12}{4} = 3 \).
   - For the second component, 2 in \( \mathbb{Z}_{8} \):
     - \( \text{gcd}(2, 8) = 2 \)
     - Therefore, the order of 2 in \( \mathbb{Z}_{8} \) is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \).

2. **Find the order of the element (4, 2)**:
   - The order of the element \( (4, 2) \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_{12} \times \mathbb{Z}_{8} \) is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of its components.
   - The orders we found are 3 and 4.
   - Now, calculate \( \text{lcm}(3, 4) \):
     - The prime factorization of 3 is \( 3^1 \) and for 4 is \( 2^2 \).
     - The LCM takes the highest power of each prime: \( 2^2 \cdot 3^1 = 4 \cdot 3 = 12 \).

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The order of the element \( (4, 2) \) is 12.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To evaluate the statements, let's analyze each one step by step.

1. **Statement 1**: ""Every ideal in a ring is a subring of the ring.""
   - An ideal is a special subset of a ring that absorbs multiplication by elements of the ring and is closed under addition. However, for a subset to be a subring, it must also contain the multiplicative identity (if the ring has one) and be closed under multiplication. Not all ideals contain the multiplicative identity of the ring. Therefore, this statement is **False**.

2. **Statement 2**: ""Every subring of every ring is an ideal of the ring.""
   - A subring is a subset of a ring that is itself a ring with the same operations. However, a subring does not necessarily absorb multiplication from the ring, which is a requirement for being an ideal. Therefore, this statement is also **False**.

Combining the evaluations of both statements, we conclude that both are false.
