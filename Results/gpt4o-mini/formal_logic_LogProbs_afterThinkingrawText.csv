"To identify the conclusion of the argument, I will analyze the statements provided. 

1. The first statement discusses the observation of weakened intelligence in peers, which sets the context but does not serve as a conclusion.
2. The second statement explains how the arrogance of consciousness acts as a defense mechanism, which is a supporting point rather than a conclusion.
3. The third statement indicates the difficulty in convincing people of the unconscious and teaching them about contradictions in their conscious knowledge. This statement summarizes the implications of the previous points and suggests a broader conclusion.
4. The fourth statement is a reiteration of the difficulty in convincing people, which is essentially a restatement of the third statement.

Given this analysis, the conclusion of the argument is best captured by the third statement, as it encapsulates the main point being made about the challenges in addressing unconscious knowledge.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To translate the statement ""David teaches Chris"" into predicate logic, I need to identify the roles of the individuals and the teaching relationship.

1. In the statement, ""David"" is the teacher and ""Chris"" is the student. Therefore, David is represented by 'd' and Chris by 'c'.
2. The predicate 'Txy' indicates that 'x teaches y'. In this case, 'x' corresponds to David ('d') and 'y' corresponds to Chris ('c').
3. Thus, the correct representation of ""David teaches Chris"" would be Tdc, where 'd' is the teacher and 'c' is the student.

Now, looking at the options:
- a) Tdc (David teaches Chris)
- b) Tcd (Chris teaches David)
- c) Tcc (Chris teaches Chris)
- d) dTc (This is not a standard representation)

The correct translation is Tdc.

Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To interpret the given proposition step by step, I will analyze the components of the logical expression:

1. The expression starts with (∃x), which indicates that there exists at least one x. The part (Ax • Lx) means that x is an apartment and x is large. So, we are talking about some large apartments.

2. The next part is (∃y)(Hy • Bxy), which means there exists at least one y such that y is a house (Hy) and x (the large apartment) is bigger than y (Bxy). 

3. Putting it all together, the proposition states that there exists a large apartment (x) that is bigger than some house (y). 

Now, let's evaluate the choices based on this interpretation:

a) Some large houses are bigger than some apartments. - This is incorrect because we are talking about large apartments, not houses.

b) Some houses are bigger than all large apartments. - This is incorrect because the proposition does not imply that houses are bigger than all large apartments.

c) Some large apartments are bigger than some houses. - This is correct as it matches our interpretation.

d) Some houses are bigger than some large apartments. - This is incorrect because it reverses the relationship.

Therefore, the best interpretation of the given proposition is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To construct a truth table for the argument, we need to evaluate the premises and the conclusion. The premises are:

1. ~G ⊃ H (If not G, then H)
2. ~H (Not H)

The conclusion is:

G (G is true)

We will evaluate the truth values of G and H, and then determine the truth values of the premises and the conclusion.

Let's create the truth table:

| G | H | ~G | ~H | ~G ⊃ H | Conclusion (G) |
|---|---|----|----|--------|----------------|
| T | T |  F |  F |   T    |       T        |
| T | F |  F |  T |   T    |       T        |
| F | T |  T |  F |   T    |       F        |
| F | F |  T |  T |   T    |       F        |

Now, let's analyze the truth table:

- The premise ~G ⊃ H is true in all cases.
- The premise ~H is false when H is true (rows 1 and 3).
- The conclusion G is true only in rows 1 and 2.

To determine if the argument is valid, we look for cases where both premises are true and the conclusion is false. 

From the truth table:
- In row 3, both premises are true (~G ⊃ H is true and ~H is true), but the conclusion G is false.

This indicates that the argument is invalid because we found a case where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

Now, we need to choose a counterexample. The counterexample occurs when G is false and H is true (row 3).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze the given formula: (~B • E) ⊃ D. The symbol ""~"" represents negation, ""•"" represents conjunction (and), and ""⊃"" represents implication (if...then).

1. The part ""~B"" means ""It is not the case that Izzy plays Minecraft.""
2. The conjunction ""• E"" means ""and Ashleigh stops by.""
3. Therefore, ""~B • E"" translates to ""It is not the case that Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by.""
4. The implication ""⊃ D"" means ""implies that Russell makes dinner.""

Putting this all together, the formula translates to: ""If it is not the case that Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by, then Russell makes dinner.""

Now, I will compare this translation with the provided choices:

a) If it's not the case that both Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by then Russell makes dinner. 
b) If it's both not the case that Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by then Russell makes dinner. 
c) Izzy playing Minecraft and Ashleigh stopping by entails that Russell makes dinner. 
d) Russell's making dinner is a sufficient condition for Izzy not playing Minecraft and Ashleigh stopping by.

The correct choice is (a) because it accurately reflects the structure of the original formula.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To interpret the given proposition (∃x)[Hx • (∀y)(Ay ⊃ Bxy)], I will break it down step by step.

1. The expression (∃x) indicates that there exists at least one x such that the following conditions hold true.
2. The part Hx means that x is a house. So, we are talking about at least one house.
3. The expression (∀y)(Ay ⊃ Bxy) means that for all y, if y is an apartment (Ay), then x (the house we are considering) is bigger than y (Bxy).

Putting this all together, the proposition states that there exists at least one house (x) such that this house is bigger than every apartment (y). 

Now, let's analyze the choices:
a) Some houses are smaller than all apartments. - This is incorrect as it contradicts the proposition.
b) Every house is bigger than every apartment. - This is too strong; the proposition only states that there exists at least one house that is bigger than all apartments, not that this is true for every house.
c) Some apartment is smaller than every house. - This is not what the proposition states.
d) Some houses are bigger than every apartment. - This aligns perfectly with the interpretation of the proposition.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To construct a truth table for the argument, we need to evaluate the premises and the conclusion. The argument is structured as follows:

1. Premise: ~K ≡ L
2. Conclusion: (K · L) ∨ (K · ~L)

We will evaluate the truth values for K and L, and then determine the truth values for ~K, ~L, and the expressions in the argument.

Let's create the truth table:

| K | L | ~K | ~L | ~K ≡ L | K · L | K · ~L | (K · L) ∨ (K · ~L) |
|---|---|----|----|--------|-------|--------|---------------------|
| T | T | F  | F  | F      | T     | F      | T                   |
| T | F | F  | T  | T      | F     | T      | T                   |
| F | T | T  | F  | T      | F     | F      | F                   |
| F | F | T  | T  | T      | F     | F      | F                   |

Now, we analyze the truth table:

- The premise ~K ≡ L is true in the following rows:
  - Row 1: K = T, L = T (True)
  - Row 2: K = T, L = F (True)
  - Row 3: K = F, L = T (True)
  - Row 4: K = F, L = F (True)

- The conclusion (K · L) ∨ (K · ~L) is true in the following rows:
  - Row 1: K = T, L = T (True)
  - Row 2: K = T, L = F (True)
  - Row 3: K = F, L = T (False)
  - Row 4: K = F, L = F (False)

Now, we check for validity:
- The argument is valid if whenever the premise is true, the conclusion is also true.
- In Row 3, the premise is true (K = F, L = T) but the conclusion is false.

Thus, the argument is invalid. 

Now, we need to find a counterexample. The counterexample occurs when K is false and L is true (Row 3).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To identify the antecedent of the conditional proposition, I need to recognize the structure of the statement. A conditional proposition typically has the form ""If P, then Q,"" where P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent.

1. In the given statement, ""If the university does not increase financial aid, either the president fails to approve it or the board of trustees prevents it,"" the part before the comma represents the condition that must be met for the rest of the statement to hold true.
2. Here, the condition is ""the university does not increase financial aid,"" which is the part that sets the premise for the rest of the statement.
3. The rest of the statement, ""either the president fails to approve it or the board of trustees prevents it,"" is the outcome that follows if the condition is met.

Thus, the antecedent of the conditional proposition is ""the university does not increase financial aid.""

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which proposition is an immediate consequence of the given premises, I will analyze the premises step by step.

1. The premises are:
   - Premise 1: ~E ⊃ ~F (If not E, then not F)
   - Premise 2: G ⊃ F (If G, then F)
   - Premise 3: H ∨ ~E (H or not E)
   - Premise 4: H ⊃ I (If H, then I)
   - Premise 5: ~I (Not I)

2. From Premise 5 (~I), we can infer that H cannot be true because if H were true, then I would also be true (from Premise 4), which contradicts ~I. Therefore, H must be false.

3. Since H is false, we can use Premise 3 (H ∨ ~E). If H is false, then for the disjunction to hold true, ~E must be true. This means E must be false.

4. If E is false (~E is true), we can apply Premise 1 (~E ⊃ ~F). Since ~E is true, it follows that ~F must also be true.

5. Now, we have established that both E is false and F is false. 

Now, let's evaluate the choices:
- a) E ⊃ F: This is not an immediate consequence since we have not established a direct relationship from the premises.
- b) F ⊃ G: This is not an immediate consequence either, as we have not derived this from the premises.
- c) H ⊃ ~E: This is not an immediate consequence since we have not established a direct relationship from the premises.
- d) ~H: This is indeed an immediate consequence since we derived that H must be false from the premises.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze the sentence ""Everybody loves Raymond, or not."" This sentence presents a situation where either the statement ""Everybody loves Raymond"" is true or it is not true. 

Next, I can identify that ""L"" represents the proposition ""Everybody loves Raymond."" The phrase ""or not"" indicates that we are considering both possibilities: either the statement is true (L) or it is false (~L).

Finally, the logical operator that represents ""or"" in propositional logic is the disjunction symbol (∨). Therefore, the best symbolization of the sentence is ""L ∨ ~L,"" which captures the idea that either ""Everybody loves Raymond"" is true or it is not true.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To translate the statement ""All kings are luckier than all paupers"" into predicate logic, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The statement indicates a relationship between two groups: kings and paupers. We denote kings with Kx and paupers with Py. The relationship of being luckier is denoted by Lxy, meaning x is luckier than y.

2. The phrase ""All kings are luckier than all paupers"" suggests that for every king (let's denote it as x), and for every pauper (let's denote it as y), the king x is luckier than the pauper y. This means we need to express that for every x that is a king, and for every y that is a pauper, the relationship Lxy holds.

3. The correct logical structure would be: For every x, if x is a king, then for every y, if y is a pauper, then x is luckier than y. This can be expressed as:
   (∀x)(Kx ⊃ (∀y)(Py ⊃ Lxy))

Now, let's match this with the provided options:

a) (∀x)Kx ⊃ (∀y)(Py ⊃ Lxy) - This matches our derived structure.
b) (∀x)Kx ⊃ (∀y)(Lxy ⊃ Py) - This suggests that if x is a king, then if x is luckier than y, y must be a pauper, which is not what we want.
c) (∀x)(∀y)(Kx • Py) ⊃ Lyx - This suggests that if x is a king and y is a pauper, then y is luckier than x, which is incorrect.
d) (∀x)(Kx • (∀y)(Py)) ⊃ Lxy - This suggests that if x is a king and for all y, y is a pauper, then x is luckier than y, which is also incorrect.

Thus, the best translation into predicate logic is option a.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the relationship between the two propositions, we will construct a truth table for each and analyze the results.

1. **Identify the propositions:**
   - Proposition 1: \( P_1 = (~M \supset ~N) \lor (O \equiv N) \)
   - Proposition 2: \( P_2 = (~M \cdot N) \cdot [(~O \lor ~N) \cdot (O \lor N)] \)

2. **Construct the truth tables:**
   - We will evaluate the truth values for all combinations of truth values for \( M, N, O \).

| M | N | O | ~M | ~N | ~O | ~M ⊃ ~N | O ≡ N | P1 | ~M · N | ~O ∨ ~N | O ∨ N | (~O ∨ ~N) · (O ∨ N) | P2 |

| T | T | T | F  | F  | F  | T       | T     | T  | F      | F       | T      | F                   | F  |
| T | T | F | F  | F  | T  | T       | F     | T  | F      | T       | T      | T                   | F  |
| T | F | T | F  | T  | F  | T       | T     | T  | F      | F       | T      | F                   | F  |
| T | F | F | F  | T  | T  | T       | F     | T  | F      | T       | F      | F                   | F  |
| F | T | T | T  | F  | F  | F       | T     | F  | T      | F       | T      | F                   | F  |
| F | T | F | T  | F  | T  | F       | F     | F  | T      | T       | T      | T                   | T  |
| F | F | T | T  | T  | F  | T       | T     | T  | F      | F       | T      | F                   | F  |
| F | F | F | T  | T  | T  | T       | F     | T  | F      | T       | F      | F                   | F  |

3. **Analyze the results:**
   - For \( P_1 \), the truth values are: T, T, T, T, F, F, T, T.
   - For \( P_2 \), the truth values are: F, F, F, F, F, T, F, F.

4. **Determine the relationship:**
   - The two propositions are not logically equivalent because their truth values do not match in all cases.
   - They are not contradictory because there are instances where both propositions can be true (e.g., when \( M = F, N = T, O = F \)).
   - Since there are cases where both propositions can be true and cases where they can be false, they are consistent.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which of the given choices is an immediate consequence of the premises, I will analyze the premises and the options step by step.

1. The premises are:
   - E ⊃ ~F (If E is true, then F is false)
   - ~F ⊃ G (If F is false, then G is true)
   - ~G (G is false)

2. From the third premise (~G), we can conclude that G is false. Since ~F ⊃ G, and we know G is false, this means that ~F must also be false (because if ~F were true, G would have to be true, which contradicts our premise).

3. If ~F is false, then F must be true. Now we can analyze the options:
   - a) E ⊃ F: This cannot be concluded directly from the premises.
   - b) F ⊃ G: This cannot be concluded directly from the premises.
   - c) G ⊃ E: This cannot be concluded directly from the premises.
   - d) ~~F: This is true because we have established that F is true, thus ~~F (not not F) is also true.

Therefore, the immediate consequence of the premises is option d.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the validity of the argument using an indirect truth table, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.

1. The premises are:
   - E ⊃ (F ∨ ~G)
   - F ⊃ (~E ∨ ~G)

2. The conclusion is:
   - ~(E ≡ F)

We will assume the conclusion is false to check for a contradiction. If ~(E ≡ F) is false, then E and F must have the same truth value (both true or both false).

**Case 1: E = T, F = T**
- If E = T, then from the first premise E ⊃ (F ∨ ~G), we have T ⊃ (T ∨ ~G), which simplifies to T ⊃ T, so this is true regardless of G.
- From the second premise F ⊃ (~E ∨ ~G), we have T ⊃ (F ∨ ~G), which simplifies to T ⊃ (~T ∨ ~G). This means T ⊃ (F ∨ ~G) must also hold. Since F is true, this is true regardless of G.
- Therefore, both premises are satisfied when E and F are true.

**Case 2: E = F = F**
- If E = F = F, then from the first premise E ⊃ (F ∨ ~G), we have F ⊃ (F ∨ ~G), which simplifies to T ⊃ (F ∨ ~G). This is true regardless of G.
- From the second premise F ⊃ (~E ∨ ~G), we have F ⊃ (~F ∨ ~G), which simplifies to F ⊃ (T ∨ ~G). This is also true regardless of G.
- Therefore, both premises are satisfied when E and F are false.

Since we found a case where both premises are true (E = T, F = T) and the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.

Now, we need to find a counterexample. The counterexample we found is when E and F are true and G can be either true or false. 

Thus, the correct answer is:
{'sol': 'b'}"
"To determine the validity of the argument using an indirect truth table, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.

1. The premises are:
   - H ≡ (~I ∨ J)
   - H ∨ ~J

2. The conclusion is:
   - ~I

To check for validity, we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false. If we can find a situation where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.

Assuming ~I is false means I is true. Now we need to evaluate the premises under this assumption.

- If I is true, then ~I is false. 
- For H ≡ (~I ∨ J) to be true, we need to evaluate the right side:
  - Since I is true, ~I is false, so we have H ≡ (false ∨ J), which simplifies to H ≡ J.
  
- For the second premise H ∨ ~J to be true:
  - Since ~I is false, we need H to be true or ~J to be true. 

Now, let's consider the case where H is true and J is false:
- If H is true, then from H ≡ J, J must also be true, which contradicts our assumption that J is false.

Now, let's consider the case where H is false:
- If H is false, then from H ≡ J, J must also be false.
- In this case, H ∨ ~J becomes false ∨ true (since ~J is true), which is true.

Thus, we have a situation where:
- H is false
- I is true
- J is false

In this case, both premises are true, and the conclusion ~I is false, which shows that the argument is invalid.

The counterexample that fits this situation is when H is false, I is true, and J is false.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To translate the statement ""Some firefighters rescue victims from danger"" into predicate logic, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the key components of the statement:
   - ""Some firefighters"" indicates the existence of at least one firefighter.
   - ""rescue victims"" indicates that these firefighters perform the action of rescuing victims.
   - ""from danger"" indicates that the victims are being rescued from a state of danger.

2. Determine the logical structure:
   - The statement suggests that there exists at least one firefighter (∃x) who rescues at least one victim (∃y) from at least one danger (∃z). This means we need to express the existence of these entities and their relationships.

3. Analyze the options:
   - Option a) suggests that for every danger, if someone is a firefighter, then there exists a victim that they rescue from that danger. This is too broad and does not match the original statement.
   - Option b) states that there exists a firefighter, a victim, and a danger, but it does not specify the relationship of rescuing clearly.
   - Option c) states that there exists a firefighter who rescues a victim from danger, which aligns well with the original statement.
   - Option d) suggests that for every firefighter, there exists a victim and a danger, which again is too broad.

Based on this analysis, the best translation into predicate logic is option c, as it correctly captures the essence of the original statement.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To identify the antecedent of the given conditional proposition, I need to analyze the structure of the statement. The proposition states that ""The university raises tuition if, and only if, both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it."" 

1. The phrase ""if, and only if"" indicates a biconditional relationship, meaning both sides of the statement are equivalent.
2. The antecedent in a conditional statement is the part that comes before the ""if"" or the condition that must be satisfied for the consequent to be true.
3. In this case, the statement can be interpreted as: ""The university raises tuition"" is the condition that depends on ""both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.""

Thus, the antecedent of the proposition is ""The university raises tuition.""

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To translate the statement ""All planets are smaller than Jupiter"" into predicate logic, I need to analyze the components of the statement.

1. The phrase ""All planets"" indicates that we are dealing with a universal quantification, which means we will use the symbol (∀x) to denote ""for all x"".
2. The condition ""x is a planet"" is represented by Px, and the relationship ""x is smaller than Jupiter"" is represented by Sxj, where j stands for Jupiter.
3. The statement asserts that if x is a planet, then x is smaller than Jupiter. This can be expressed as ""if x is a planet (Px), then x is smaller than Jupiter (Sxj)"".

Putting this together, the correct translation is: (∀x)(Px ⊃ Sxj).

Now, I will check the options:
- a) (∃x)(Px • Sxj) - This means ""there exists at least one planet that is smaller than Jupiter"", which is not what we want.
- b) (∀x)(Px • Sxj) - This means ""for all x, x is a planet and x is smaller than Jupiter"", which is also incorrect.
- c) (∀x)(Px ⊃ Sjx) - This incorrectly states that if x is a planet, then Jupiter is smaller than x, which is the opposite of what we want.
- d) (∀x)(Px ⊃ Sxj) - This correctly states that if x is a planet, then x is smaller than Jupiter.

Thus, the best translation into predicate logic is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To translate the statement ""José introduces Wilma to Kevin"" into predicate logic, we need to identify the roles of each individual in the context of the introduction.

1. José (j) is the one doing the introducing.
2. Wilma (w) is the one being introduced.
3. Kevin (k) is the one to whom Wilma is being introduced.

The predicate Ixyz indicates that x introduces y to z. In this case:
- x corresponds to José (j),
- y corresponds to Wilma (w),
- z corresponds to Kevin (k).

Putting this together, the correct translation would be Ijwk, which means ""José introduces Wilma to Kevin.""

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To translate the statement ""No artifacts are people"" into predicate logic, we need to understand the components involved. 

1. The statement implies that for every object, if it is an artifact, then it is not a person. This suggests a universal quantification over all objects.
2. We can denote ""A"" as the predicate for ""is an artifact"" and ""P"" as the predicate for ""is a person.""
3. The correct logical form would be that for all x, if x is an artifact (Ax), then x is not a person (¬Px).

Now, let's analyze the options:
- a) ~Pa: This suggests that there is no specific individual that is a person, which does not capture the original statement.
- b) (∀x)(Ax ⊃ ~Px): This correctly states that for all x, if x is an artifact, then x is not a person.
- c) ~Ap: Similar to option a, this suggests that there is no specific individual that is an artifact.
- d) (∀x)(Ax • ~Px): This incorrectly suggests that for all x, x is both an artifact and not a person, which is not what the original statement conveys.

Thus, the best translation into predicate logic is option b.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To construct a truth table for the argument \( P \supset Q \), \( Q \cdot R \) leading to \( \sim P \cdot R \), we will evaluate all possible truth values for \( P \), \( Q \), and \( R \).

   - There are 2^3 = 8 combinations.

2. **Calculate the truth values for \( P \supset Q \), \( Q \cdot R \), and \( \sim P \cdot R \)**:

   - \( Q \cdot R \) is true only if both \( Q \) and \( R \) are true.
   - \( \sim P \cdot R \) is true if \( P \) is false and \( R \) is true.

| F | T | F | T                 | F               | T             | F                     |
| F | F | T | T                 | F               | T             | T                     |
| F | F | F | T                 | F               | T             | F                     |

4. **Analyze the truth table**:
   - The argument is valid if whenever both premises \( P \supset Q \) and \( Q \cdot R \) are true, the conclusion \( \sim P \cdot R \) is also true.
   - From the table, we see that:
     - In the row where \( P = F \), \( Q = T \), and \( R = T \), both premises are true, but the conclusion \( \sim P \cdot R \) is also true.
     - However, in the row where \( P = F \), \( Q = F \), and \( R = T \), the premises are true, but the conclusion is also true.
     - The critical row is when \( P = T \), \( Q = T \), and \( R = F \) where \( P \supset Q \) is true, \( Q \cdot R \) is false, and the conclusion is false.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The argument is invalid because there are cases where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false.
   - A counterexample is when \( P \) is true, \( Q \) is true, and \( R \) is false.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To translate the statement ""Marco moves from Italy to Spain"" into predicate logic using the provided symbols, I need to identify the components of the statement:

1. Marco (m) is the subject who is moving.
2. Italy (i) is the location he is moving from.
3. Spain (s) is the location he is moving to.

The predicate Mxyz indicates that x moves to y from z. In this case:
- x corresponds to Marco (m),
- y corresponds to Spain (s),
- z corresponds to Italy (i).

Putting this together, the correct translation would be Mims, which indicates that Marco moves to Spain from Italy.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To interpret the given proposition step by step, let's break it down:

1. The proposition starts with (∀x){Ax ⊃ (∀y)[(Hy • Ly) ⊃ ∼Bxy]}. This means ""For all x, if x is an apartment, then for all y, if y is a house and y is large, then x is not bigger than y.""

2. The key components are:
   - Ax: x is an apartment
   - Hy: y is a house
   - Ly: y is large
   - ∼Bxy: x is not bigger than y

3. The interpretation of the proposition indicates that if something is an apartment, it cannot be bigger than any large house. This leads us to conclude that no apartment is bigger than any large house.

Based on this analysis, the best English interpretation of the proposition is: b) No apartment is bigger than any large house.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To construct a complete truth table for the argument, we need to evaluate the premises and the conclusion based on the truth values of J, K, and L. The premises are J ≡ ~K and J ∨ L, and the conclusion is L.

1. **Identify the components**:
   - J
   - K
   - L
   - ~K (not K)
   - J ≡ ~K (J is equivalent to not K)
   - J ∨ L (J or L)

2. **Construct the truth table**:

| J | K | L | ~K | J ≡ ~K | J ∨ L | L |
|---|---|---|----|--------|-------|---|
| T | T | T | F  | F      | T     | T |
| T | T | F | F  | F      | T     | F |
| T | F | T | T  | T      | T     | T |
| T | F | F | T  | T      | T     | F |
| F | T | T | F  | T      | T     | T |
| F | T | F | F  | T      | F     | F |
| F | F | T | T  | F      | T     | T |
| F | F | F | T  | F      | F     | F |

3. **Analyze the truth table**:
   - The argument is valid if whenever the premises are true, the conclusion is also true.
   - From the truth table, we see that:
     - When J is true and K is true (rows 1 and 2), J ≡ ~K is false, so we don't consider these rows.
     - When J is true and K is false (rows 3 and 4), J ≡ ~K is true, and J ∨ L is true, but L is false in row 4.
     - When J is false and K is true (rows 5 and 6), J ≡ ~K is true, but L is false in row 6.
     - When J is false and K is false (rows 7 and 8), J ≡ ~K is false in row 8.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The argument is invalid because there are cases (specifically row 4 and row 6) where both premises are true, but the conclusion L is false.

Now, we need to choose a counterexample. The counterexample occurs when J is true, K is false, and L is false (row 4).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the best symbolization of the sentence ""Pablo will go to the store if, and only if, his brother drives him and pays for gas,"" I will analyze the components of the statement step by step.

1. The phrase ""if, and only if"" indicates a biconditional relationship. This means that Pablo going to the store (P) is true if and only if both conditions (his brother driving him (D) and paying for gas (G)) are true. This suggests that we need a biconditional operator (≡) in our formula.

2. The conditions that must be satisfied for Pablo to go to the store are that his brother drives him (D) and pays for gas (G). This can be represented as a conjunction (D • G).

3. Therefore, the complete relationship can be expressed as: Pablo going to the store (P) is equivalent to both his brother driving him and paying for gas (D • G). This leads us to the formula: P ≡ (D • G).

Now, I will check the options provided:
- a) (P ≡ D) ≡ G: This does not represent the relationship correctly.
- b) (D • G) ⊃ P: This suggests that driving and paying for gas implies going to the store, but does not capture the biconditional nature.
- c) P ⊃ (D • G): This suggests that going to the store implies driving and paying for gas, but again does not capture the biconditional nature.
- d) P ≡ (D • G): This correctly represents the biconditional relationship.

Thus, the best symbolization of the sentence is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine whether the set of propositions is consistent, I will analyze the propositions step by step.

1. The propositions are:
   - D ≡ E (D is equivalent to E)
   - F ∨ D (F or D is true)
   - ~E · ~F (Not E and Not F are both true)

2. Let's analyze the implications of these propositions:
   - From D ≡ E, we know that D and E must have the same truth value (both true or both false).
   - From F ∨ D, at least one of F or D must be true.
   - From ~E · ~F, both E and F must be false.

3. Now, let's see if we can find a consistent valuation:
   - If E is false (from ~E), then D must also be false (from D ≡ E).
   - If D is false, then F must be true (from F ∨ D) to satisfy the disjunction.
   - However, if F is true, then ~F is false, which contradicts the requirement that ~E · ~F is true.

Since we cannot find a valuation that satisfies all three propositions simultaneously, the set of propositions is inconsistent.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the best symbolization of the sentence ""The restaurant serves pie or cheesecake or ice cream for dessert,"" I will analyze the options step by step.

1. The sentence indicates that there are three dessert options: pie (P), cheesecake (C), and ice cream (I). The use of ""or"" suggests that any of these desserts can be served.

2. In propositional logic, the symbol ""∨"" represents the logical ""or."" Therefore, I need to combine the three options using ""∨"".

3. The simplest and most straightforward way to express ""pie or cheesecake or ice cream"" is to write it as P ∨ C ∨ I. This captures all three options without unnecessary parentheses.

Now, I will evaluate the choices:
- a) P ∨ (C ∨ I) - This is valid but adds unnecessary parentheses.
- b) (P ∨ C) ∨ I - This is also valid but similarly adds unnecessary parentheses.
- c) P ∨ C ∨ I - This is the most straightforward and clear representation.
- d) Options A and B - This is incorrect since A and B are not the best representations.

Thus, the best symbolization is option c.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the best symbolization of the sentence ""If Beth rides her bike, she gets to work earlier,"" I will analyze the components of the statement step by step.

1. The sentence is a conditional statement, which can be identified by the phrase ""If... then..."". In this case, ""If Beth rides her bike"" is the antecedent (B), and ""she gets to work earlier"" is the consequent (W).

2. The correct logical representation of a conditional statement is represented by the symbol ""⊃"" (which means ""if... then...""). Therefore, the statement can be symbolized as B ⊃ W.

3. Now, I will evaluate the options:
   - a) B ⊃ W: This correctly represents the conditional statement.
   - b) W ⊃ B: This would imply that if she gets to work earlier, then she rode her bike, which is not what the original statement conveys.
   - c) B ≡ W: This suggests that riding her bike and getting to work earlier are equivalent, which is also not correct.
   - d) Both A and B: Since option b is incorrect, this option cannot be correct.

Based on this analysis, the best symbolization of the sentence is option a) B ⊃ W.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To translate the statement ""Either Taylor or Eric is a latte boy"" into predicate logic, I need to identify the components of the statement.

1. Identify the subjects: Taylor and Eric. Let's denote Taylor as 't' and Eric as 'e'.
2. Identify the predicate: ""is a latte boy"". Let's denote this predicate as 'L', where 'Lx' means ""x is a latte boy"".
3. The statement is an ""either/or"" situation, which is represented by the logical disjunction (∨).

Now, I can construct the logical expression:
- The statement can be expressed as ""Taylor is a latte boy or Eric is a latte boy"", which translates to: L(t) ∨ L(e).

Now, let's match this with the provided options:
a) Lt ∨ Le - This translates to ""Taylor is a latte boy or Eric is a latte boy"", which is correct.
b) Lx ∨ Ly - This is too general and does not specify Taylor and Eric.
c) tL ∨ eL - This is not a correct representation in predicate logic.
d) Tl ⊃ El - This translates to ""If Taylor is a latte boy, then Eric is a latte boy"", which is not the same as the original statement.

The best translation into predicate logic is option a) Lt ∨ Le.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the validity of the argument using an indirect truth table, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.

1. The premises are:
   - E ⊃ F (If E is true, then F is true)
   - G ⊃ ~F (If G is true, then F is false)

2. The conclusion is:
   - ~G ∨ ~E (Either G is false or E is false)

To check for validity, we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false. If we can find a situation where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.

3. The conclusion ~G ∨ ~E is false only when both G is true and E is true. Therefore, we will set E = true and G = true.

4. Now, we need to check the truth values of F:
   - From the first premise E ⊃ F, since E is true, F must also be true.
   - From the second premise G ⊃ ~F, since G is true, ~F must be true, which means F must be false.

This creates a contradiction because we cannot have F being both true and false at the same time.

Since we have found a situation where the premises are true (E = true, G = true) and the conclusion is false (since ~G ∨ ~E is false), the argument is invalid.

Now, we can choose the appropriate counterexample from the options provided. The correct counterexample is when E and G are true and F is false.

Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine whether the set of propositions is consistent, I will analyze the propositions step by step.

1. **List the propositions**:
   - P1: A ⊃ (~B ∨ C)
   - P2: C ⊃ D
   - P3: A ∨ (B · ~D)
   - P4: A ≡ (B ⊃ D)

2. **Check for consistency**:
   - A set of propositions is consistent if there is at least one assignment of truth values to the variables that makes all propositions true.

3. **Evaluate the choices**:
   - **Choice b**: A = T, D = T, B = F, C = F
     - P1: A ⊃ (~B ∨ C) → T ⊃ (T ∨ F) → T (True)
     - P2: C ⊃ D → F ⊃ T → T (True)
     - P3: A ∨ (B · ~D) → T ∨ (F · F) → T (True)
     - P4: A ≡ (B ⊃ D) → T ≡ (F ⊃ T) → T ≡ T → T (True)
     - All propositions are true, so this valuation is consistent.

   - **Choice c**: A = T, B = T, D = T, C = F
     - P1: A ⊃ (~B ∨ C) → T ⊃ (F ∨ F) → T ⊃ F → F (False)
     - This valuation is inconsistent.

   - **Choice d**: C = T, D = T, A = F, B = F
     - P1: A ⊃ (~B ∨ C) → F ⊃ (T ∨ T) → T (True)
     - P2: C ⊃ D → T ⊃ T → T (True)
     - P3: A ∨ (B · ~D) → F ∨ (F · F) → F (False)
     - This valuation is inconsistent.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The only consistent valuation found is in choice b.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the validity of the argument using a truth table, we will analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.

1. **Identify the components**: The premises are \( M \lor N \) and \( \sim M \cdot O \), and the conclusion is \( N \).

2. **Construct the truth table**: We will evaluate all possible truth values for \( M \), \( N \), and \( O \).

| M | N | O | M ∨ N | ~M | ~M · O | N |
|---|---|---|-------|----|--------|---|
| T | T | T |   T   | F  |   F    | T |
| T | T | F |   T   | F  |   F    | T |
| T | F | T |   T   | F  |   F    | F |
| T | F | F |   T   | F  |   F    | F |
| F | T | T |   T   | T  |   T    | T |
| F | T | F |   T   | T  |   F    | T |
| F | F | T |   F   | T  |   T    | F |
| F | F | F |   F   | T  |   F    | F |

3. **Analyze the truth table**: We need to check the rows where both premises \( M \lor N \) and \( \sim M \cdot O \) are true and see if the conclusion \( N \) is also true.

- The only row where both premises are true is the fifth row (M = F, N = T, O = T). Here, \( N \) is true.
- The sixth row (M = F, N = T, O = F) also has both premises true, and \( N \) is true.
- The seventh row (M = F, N = F, O = T) has both premises true, but \( N \) is false.

Since we found a case (the seventh row) where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.

4. **Identify a counterexample**: The counterexample from the truth table is when \( M \) is false, \( N \) is false, and \( O \) is true.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which proposition is an immediate consequence of the given premises, I will analyze the premises step by step.

1. The first premise is \( U \supset W \). This means if \( U \) is true, then \( W \) must also be true.
2. The second premise is \( W \supset (X \equiv \sim Y) \). This means if \( W \) is true, then \( (X \equiv \sim Y) \) must also be true.
3. The third premise is \( (X \equiv \sim Y) \supset Z \). This means if \( (X \equiv \sim Y) \) is true, then \( Z \) must also be true.
4. The fourth premise is \( \sim Z \). This means \( Z \) is false.

Now, since \( Z \) is false (\( \sim Z \)), we can use the third premise. If \( Z \) is false, then \( (X \equiv \sim Y) \) must also be false (because if \( (X \equiv \sim Y) \) were true, then \( Z \) would have to be true). Therefore, we conclude that \( \sim (X \equiv \sim Y) \) is true.

Now, let's evaluate the choices:
a) \( U \supset Z \) - This cannot be concluded because \( Z \) is false.
b) \( U \lor W \) - This cannot be concluded directly from the premises.
c) \( \sim W \) - This cannot be concluded directly from the premises.
d) \( \sim (X \equiv \sim Y) \) - This is true based on our deduction.

Thus, the immediate consequence of the premises is \( \sim (X \equiv \sim Y) \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To identify the antecedent of the conditional proposition ""If the Bees don't win their first game, then both the Aardvarks and the Chipmunks win their first games,"" I need to recognize the structure of a conditional statement, which is typically in the form ""If P, then Q.""

1. In this case, ""P"" is the condition that must be met for ""Q"" to follow. Here, ""P"" is ""The Bees don't win their first game.""
2. ""Q"" is the result that follows if ""P"" is true, which in this case is ""Both the Aardvarks and the Chipmunks win their first games.""
3. Therefore, the antecedent of the conditional proposition is the part that comes after ""If,"" which is ""The Bees don't win their first game.""

Based on the choices provided, the correct answer is b) The Bees don't win their first game.

Thus, the answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To translate the statement ""Holly loves Frances"" into predicate logic, I need to identify the correct order of the subjects and the predicate.

1. The subject ""Holly"" corresponds to the variable 'h'.
2. The object ""Frances"" corresponds to the variable 'f'.
3. The predicate ""loves"" is represented by 'Lxy', where 'x' is the lover and 'y' is the loved one.

In this case, since Holly is the one who loves Frances, 'h' should be the first argument (the lover), and 'f' should be the second argument (the loved one). Therefore, the correct representation is Lhf.

Thus, the best translation into predicate logic is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the validity of the argument using an indirect truth table, we will assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false. The premises are:

1. \( P \supset (Q \lor R) \)
2. \( (Q \cdot S) \supset \sim P \)

The conclusion is:

3. \( \sim P \)

Assuming the conclusion \( \sim P \) is false means \( P \) is true. 

Now, let's analyze the premises under the assumption that \( P \) is true:

1. Since \( P \) is true, \( P \supset (Q \lor R) \) implies that \( Q \lor R \) must also be true. Therefore, either \( Q \) is true, \( R \) is true, or both are true.
2. The second premise \( (Q \cdot S) \supset \sim P \) must also hold true. Since \( P \) is true, \( \sim P \) is false, which means \( (Q \cdot S) \) must also be false (because if the antecedent is true, the consequent must be true for the implication to hold). Therefore, either \( Q \) is false or \( S \) is false (or both).

Now we have two conditions:
- \( Q \lor R \) is true (meaning at least one of \( Q \) or \( R \) is true).
- \( Q \cdot S \) is false (meaning at least one of \( Q \) or \( S \) is false).

To find a counterexample, we can set:
- \( P \) = true
- \( Q \) = true
- \( R \) = true
- \( S \) = false

In this case:
- \( Q \lor R \) is true (since both \( Q \) and \( R \) are true).
- \( Q \cdot S \) is false (since \( S \) is false).

This satisfies both premises while making the conclusion \( \sim P \) false (since \( P \) is true). Thus, the argument is invalid.

Now, let's check the options for a counterexample:
- a) Valid (not correct)
- b) Invalid. Counterexample when P, Q, R, and S are true (not correct)
- c) Invalid. Counterexample when P and Q are true and R and S are false (this is a valid counterexample)
- d) Invalid. Counterexample when P, R, and S are true and Q is false (not correct)

The correct answer is option c.

Therefore, the final answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To construct a truth table for the argument \( T \lor U \), \( W \cdot T \) / \( U \), we will evaluate all possible truth values for the propositions \( T \), \( U \), and \( W \).

1. **List all combinations of truth values** for \( T \), \( U \), and \( W \):
   - T, U, W can each be True (T) or False (F), leading to \( 2^3 = 8 \) combinations.

2. **Construct the truth table**:

| T | U | W | T ∨ U | W · T | U |
|---|---|---|-------|-------|---|
| T | T | T |   T   |   T   | T |
| T | T | F |   T   |   F   | T |
| T | F | T |   T   |   T   | F |

| F | F | T |   F   |   F   | F |
| F | F | F |   F   |   F   | F |

3. **Analyze the truth table**:
   - The argument is valid if whenever the premises \( T \lor U \) and \( W \cdot T \) are both true, the conclusion \( U \) is also true.
   - From the truth table, we see:
     - In the first row, both premises are true, and the conclusion is true.
     - In the third row, both premises are true, but the conclusion is false (U is F).
     - This indicates that the argument is invalid.

4. **Identify a counterexample**:
   - The third row provides a counterexample where \( T \) is true, \( W \) is true, and \( U \) is false.

Thus, the argument is invalid, and the counterexample is when \( T \) is true and \( W \) is true, while \( U \) is false.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To identify the antecedent of the conditional proposition, I need to understand the structure of the statement. The statement is in the form ""P if Q,"" where Q is the condition that must be met for P to occur.

1. The proposition states that ""The university raises tuition"" is the outcome (P), which occurs if both conditions are satisfied (Q).
2. The conditions are ""the governor approves of it"" and ""the board of trustees recommends it."" Both of these conditions must be true for the outcome to happen.
3. Therefore, the antecedent is the entire condition that leads to the outcome, which is ""the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.""

Thus, the antecedent is option d) ""The governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.""

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To identify the antecedent of the conditional proposition, I need to understand the structure of the statement. A conditional proposition typically has the form ""If P, then Q,"" where P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent.

1. In the given statement, ""The restaurant does not have peas, so instead they serve corn and potatoes,"" the phrase ""The restaurant does not have peas"" can be interpreted as the condition that leads to the outcome of serving corn and potatoes.
2. The antecedent is the part that provides the condition for the conclusion. Here, the condition is that the restaurant does not have peas.
3. Therefore, the antecedent of the conditional proposition is ""The restaurant does not have peas.""

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To translate the statement ""All jellybeans are sweeter than all fruit"" into predicate logic, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The statement indicates a relationship between two categories: jellybeans and fruit. We denote jellybeans with Jx and fruit with Fx. The relationship of sweetness is denoted by Sxy, where x is sweeter than y.

2. The phrase ""All jellybeans are sweeter than all fruit"" suggests that for every jellybean (let's denote it as Jx), it is sweeter than every fruit (denote it as Fy). This means that for every jellybean, we can find that it is sweeter than any fruit.

3. Therefore, the correct logical structure should express that for every jellybean x, and for every fruit y, the jellybean x is sweeter than the fruit y. This can be expressed as: (∀x)(Jx ⊃ (∀y)(Fy ⊃ Sxy)).

Now, looking at the provided options, the one that matches this structure is:

d) (∀x)Jx ⊃ (∀y)(Fy ⊃ Sxy).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To identify the conclusion of the argument, I will analyze the statements provided. 

1. The first statement suggests that ""the world is my idea"" is a universal truth, but only humans can contemplate this idea, leading to philosophical wisdom. This indicates a premise rather than a conclusion.
  
2. The second statement emphasizes that no truth is more certain than the relationship between knowledge and existence, which again serves as a supporting premise rather than a conclusion.

3. The third statement, ""the world is an idea,"" is presented as a definitive assertion. It encapsulates the essence of the argument and serves as the conclusion drawn from the preceding premises.

4. The other options either elaborate on the premises or provide context but do not serve as the final conclusion of the argument.

Thus, the conclusion of the argument is clearly stated as ""the world is an idea.""

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To translate the statement ""Leo is taller than Cathy"" into predicate logic, we need to identify the correct order of the variables and the predicate.

1. The statement indicates a relationship where Leo (l) is taller than Cathy (c). In predicate logic, this relationship is represented by the predicate Txy, where x is taller than y.
2. In this case, Leo is the one who is taller (x), and Cathy is the one who is shorter (y). Therefore, we need to express this as T(l, c).
3. The correct representation of ""Leo is taller than Cathy"" would be Tlc, meaning T(l, c).

Now, looking at the options:
- a) Tlc: This means Leo is taller than Cathy, which is correct.
- b) Tcl: This means Cathy is taller than Leo, which is incorrect.
- c) lTc: This is not a valid representation in the context of the predicate.
- d) cTl: This also means Cathy is taller than Leo, which is incorrect.

Thus, the best translation into predicate logic is option a) Tlc.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the relationship between the propositions \( C \supset (D \lor C) \) and \( C \cdot \sim D \), we will construct a truth table for both statements.

| T | T |   T   |      T      |  F |   F    |
| T | F |   T   |      T      |  T |   T    |
| F | T |   T   |      T      |  F |   F    |
| F | F |   F   |      T      |  T |   F    |

3. **Analyze the truth values**:
   - The column for \( C \supset (D \lor C) \) shows that it is true in all cases (T, T, T, T).
   - The column for \( C \cdot \sim D \) shows that it is true only when \( C \) is true and \( D \) is false (T, F, F, F).

4. **Determine the relationship**:
   - Since \( C \supset (D \lor C) \) is always true, and \( C \cdot \sim D \) is not always true, they are not logically equivalent.
   - They are also not contradictory because they can both be true in some cases (when \( C \) is true and \( D \) is false).
   - Therefore, they are neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but they can be consistent since there are scenarios where both can be true.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the relationship between the propositions ~O ⊃ P and O ∨ P, I will construct a truth table for both statements.

1. **Identify the propositions**:
   - Let O be a proposition.
   - Let P be a proposition.

2. **Construct the truth table**:
   - The truth values for O and P can be either True (T) or False (F).
   - The negation of O (~O) will be the opposite of O.
   - The implication (~O ⊃ P) is true unless ~O is true and P is false.
   - The disjunction (O ∨ P) is true if at least one of O or P is true.

| O   | P   | ~O  | ~O ⊃ P | O ∨ P |
|-----|-----|-----|--------|-------|
| T   | T   | F   | T      | T     |

| F   | T   | T   | T      | T     |
| F   | F   | T   | F      | F     |

3. **Analyze the truth table**:
   - The column for ~O ⊃ P is: T, T, T, F.
   - The column for O ∨ P is: T, T, T, F.

4. **Determine the relationship**:
   - The two statements are not logically equivalent because their truth values do not match in all cases (they are equal in the first three rows but differ in the last row).
   - They are not contradictory because there are instances (the first three rows) where both statements are true.
   - Since there are cases where both statements can be true, they are consistent.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the validity of the argument using an indirect truth table, I will analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.

1. The premises are:
   - (T · ~U) ⊃ ~W
   - ~W ⊃ X
   - ~Z ⊃ W

   The conclusion is:
   - T ⊃ U

2. To check for validity, I will assume the conclusion is false (T is true and U is false) and see if this leads to a contradiction with the premises.

3. If T is true and U is false, then:
   - ~U is true.
   - Therefore, (T · ~U) is true, which means ~W must be false (since (T · ~U) ⊃ ~W is true).
   - If ~W is false, then W is true.
   - Now, since W is true, the second premise ~W ⊃ X is vacuously true regardless of the truth value of X.
   - For the third premise ~Z ⊃ W to hold true, since W is true, Z can be either true or false without causing a contradiction.

4. However, if we assume Z is true, then ~Z is false, and the third premise does not provide any contradiction. 

5. Now, if we take the counterexample provided in option b) where T, X, and Z are true and U and W are false:
   - T is true, U is false, W is false, and X is true, Z is true.
   - This leads to:
     - (T · ~U) is true (since T is true and U is false).
     - Therefore, ~W must be false (since W is false).
     - The second premise ~W ⊃ X is true (since X is true).
     - The third premise ~Z ⊃ W is false (since Z is true and W is false), which leads to a contradiction.

Thus, the argument is invalid, and the counterexample provided in option b) demonstrates this.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To translate the statement ""Cecilia breaks my heart if, and only if, Maria is either a problem or a girl"" into predicate logic, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the components of the statement:
   - ""Cecilia breaks my heart"" can be represented as Bc.
   - ""Maria is either a problem or a girl"" can be represented as (Pm ∨ Gm).

2. The phrase ""if, and only if"" indicates a biconditional relationship, which is represented by the symbol ""≡"". This means that both sides of the statement are equivalent.

3. Therefore, the correct translation of the entire statement into predicate logic is Bc ≡ (Pm ∨ Gm).

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To translate the statement ""If Delilah is in New York City, then Juana is in Bogota or Layla is in San Juan"" into predicate logic, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the components of the statement:
   - Let \( N_d \) represent ""Delilah is in New York City.""
   - Let \( B_j \) represent ""Juana is in Bogota.""
   - Let \( S_l \) represent ""Layla is in San Juan.""

2. The structure of the statement is a conditional (""if...then..."") which indicates that if the first part is true, then at least one of the second parts must be true. This means we need to use the implication symbol (⊃) for the ""if...then..."" part and the disjunction symbol (∨) for the ""or"" part.

3. The correct logical form will be: If \( N_d \) (Delilah is in New York City), then \( B_j \) (Juana is in Bogota) or \( S_l \) (Layla is in San Juan). This translates to \( N_d \supset (B_j \lor S_l) \).

Thus, the best translation into predicate logic is option d) \( N_d \supset (B_j \lor S_l) \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To translate the given formula ~(A ⊃ B) • (B ⊃ ~E) into natural English sentences, I will break it down step by step.

1. The first part of the formula is ~(A ⊃ B), which means ""It is not the case that if Marina reads a Percy Jackson book, then Izzy plays Minecraft."" This can be interpreted as ""Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book does not entail that Izzy plays Minecraft.""

2. The second part of the formula is (B ⊃ ~E), which means ""If Izzy plays Minecraft, then Ashleigh does not stop by."" This can be interpreted as ""Izzy's playing Minecraft entails that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.""

3. Combining these interpretations, the full translation of the formula is: ""It's not the case that Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book entails that Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy's playing Minecraft does entail that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.""

Now, I will match this translation with the provided choices.

The correct choice is a) ""It's not the case that Marina's reading a Percy Jackson book entails that Izzy plays Minecraft, but Izzy's playing Minecraft does entail that Ashleigh doesn't stop by.""

Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the validity of the argument using an indirect truth table, we will assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, and then check for contradictions.

1. The premises are:
   - (A ∨ B) ⊃ C (Premise 1)
   - C ⊃ ~D (Premise 2)

   The conclusion is:
   - D ⊃ A (Conclusion)

2. We assume the conclusion is false, which means D is true and A is false. This gives us:
   - D = True
   - A = False

3. Now, we need to evaluate the premises under these assumptions:
   - For (A ∨ B) ⊃ C to be true, since A is false, B must be true for (A ∨ B) to be true. Therefore, we have:
     - B = True
     - (A ∨ B) = True
   - This means C must also be true for the implication to hold:
     - C = True

4. Now we check the second premise C ⊃ ~D:
   - Since C is true and D is true, ~D is false. Therefore, C ⊃ ~D is false.

5. Since we have found a situation where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.

Now, we need to find a counterexample that matches one of the options provided. We have:
- A = False
- B = True
- C = True
- D = True

This matches option b) Invalid. Counterexample when B, C, and D are true and A is false.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To interpret the given arguments in predicate logic, I will analyze each part step by step.

1. The first statement, ""Dh ⊃ ~Pt,"" translates to ""If my headache is a dualist state, then your tickle is not a physical state."" This indicates a conditional relationship between the headache being a dualist state and the tickle being a physical state.

2. The second statement, ""(∀x)Px ∨ (∀x)Mx,"" means ""Either everything is physical or everything is mental."" This suggests a dichotomy between physical and mental states.

3. The third statement, ""~Mb,"" translates to ""My broken toe is not a mental state."" This indicates that the broken toe does not fall under the category of mental states.

4. The conclusion, ""/ ~Dh,"" means ""So my headache is not a dualist state."" This follows from the previous statements.

Now, I will evaluate the choices based on this analysis:

- Choice a) correctly interprets the first statement but incorrectly states the second part about everything being physical or mental.
- Choice b) misinterprets the first statement by saying ""your tickle is not a physical state"" instead of ""your tickle is a physical state.""
- Choice c) misinterprets the second statement by saying ""If everything is physical then everything is mental,"" which is not accurate.
- Choice d) correctly interprets all parts of the argument, stating that if my headache is a dualist state, then your tickle is not a physical state, and that everything is either physical or mental.

Therefore, the best interpretation is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which proposition is an immediate consequence of the given premises, let's analyze the premises step by step.

1. The first premise is \( A \supset (B \cdot C) \), which means ""if A is true, then both B and C are true.""
2. The second premise is \( \sim (B \cdot C) \), which means ""it is not the case that both B and C are true."" This implies that at least one of B or C must be false.
3. From the second premise, since \( B \cdot C \) is false, we can conclude that \( A \) must also be false. This is because if \( A \) were true, then \( B \cdot C \) would have to be true (from the first premise), which contradicts the second premise.

Since we have established that \( A \) must be false, we can conclude that \( \sim A \) is true.

Now, let's check the options:
- a) A: This cannot be true since we concluded \( A \) is false.
- b) \( \sim A \): This is true based on our conclusion.
- c) B: We cannot conclude that B is true since we only know that at least one of B or C is false.
- d) \( \sim B \): We cannot conclude this either, as we do not have enough information to determine the truth value of B alone.

Thus, the immediate consequence of the premises is \( \sim A \).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which proposition is an immediate consequence of the given premises, I will analyze the premises step by step.

1. The first premise is (N ⊃ ~O) ⊃ (O ∨ Q). This means if N implies not O, then either O is true or Q is true.
2. The second premise is P ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O). This means if P is true, then N implies not O.
3. The third premise is N ⊃ P. This means if N is true, then P is true.

Now, let's see how these premises relate to the choices:

- If we assume N is true, then from the third premise (N ⊃ P), P must also be true.
- Since P is true, from the second premise (P ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O)), we can conclude that (N ⊃ ~O) is true.
- Now, since (N ⊃ ~O) is true, we can apply the first premise (N ⊃ ~O) ⊃ (O ∨ Q) to conclude that (O ∨ Q) must also be true.

Thus, the immediate consequence of the premises is O ∨ Q.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To translate the statement ""Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter"" into predicate logic, we need to analyze the meaning of the statement.

1. The phrase ""isn't bigger than"" can be interpreted as ""is either smaller than or equal to."" However, in this context, we will focus on the direct negation of the relationship ""bigger than.""
2. The statement can be expressed as ""It is not the case that Earth is bigger than Jupiter."" In predicate logic, this can be represented as the negation of the predicate B (bigger than).
3. Therefore, the correct translation would be the negation of the relationship where Earth is bigger than Jupiter, which is represented as ~Bej.

Thus, the best translation into predicate logic is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To identify the antecedent of the given conditional proposition, I need to analyze the structure of the statement. The statement can be interpreted as follows:

1. The proposition states that ""The Bees winning their first game is necessary for either the Aardvarks or the Chipmunks not winning their first game."" This means that if the Aardvarks or the Chipmunks do not win their first game, then the Bees must win their first game.

2. In a conditional statement, the antecedent is the part that comes before the implication. Here, the implication is that the Bees winning their first game is a necessary condition for the other events (Aardvarks or Chipmunks not winning).

3. Therefore, the antecedent in this context is the condition that must be true for the conclusion to hold. The conclusion is that either the Aardvarks or the Chipmunks do not win their first game, which means the antecedent is ""The Bees win their first game.""

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To identify the antecedent of the conditional proposition, I need to understand the structure of the statement. The statement is ""The Bees win their first game only if either the Aardvarks or the Chipmunks do not win their first games."" 

1. In a conditional statement of the form ""P only if Q,"" P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent. Here, ""The Bees win their first game"" is the condition that leads to the outcome described by ""either the Aardvarks or the Chipmunks do not win their first games.""

2. The phrase ""only if"" indicates that the first part (the Bees winning) can happen only under the condition that the second part (either the Aardvarks or the Chipmunks not winning) is true.

3. Therefore, the antecedent of the proposition is ""The Bees win their first game,"" which corresponds to option b.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To translate the statement ""Some athletes don't get injured"" into predicate logic, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the components: The statement refers to ""some athletes"" which indicates the use of existential quantification (∃). The phrase ""don't get injured"" suggests a negation of the injury predicate.

2. Define the predicates: Let A(x) represent ""x is an athlete"" and I(x) represent ""x gets injured"". The statement can be interpreted as there exists at least one athlete who does not get injured.

3. Formulate the logical expression: The correct translation would be that there exists an x such that x is an athlete and x does not get injured. This can be expressed as (∃x)(Ax • ~Ix).

Now, I can conclude that the best translation into predicate logic is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the relationship between the propositions I ≡ ~H and ~(~I ≡ H), we will construct a truth table for both statements and analyze their results.

1. **Identify the propositions**:
   - Let I be a proposition.
   - Let H be a proposition.
   - The first statement is I ≡ ~H (I is equivalent to not H).
   - The second statement is ~(~I ≡ H) (not of the equivalence of not I and H).

2. **Construct the truth table**:
   We will evaluate the truth values for I, H, ~H, ~I, ~I ≡ H, and then the two main propositions.

| I | H | ~H | ~I | ~I ≡ H | I ≡ ~H | ~(~I ≡ H) |
|---|---|----|----|--------|--------|-----------|
| T | T | F  | F  | T      | F      | F         |
| T | F | T  | F  | F      | T      | T         |
| F | T | F  | T  | T      | T      | F         |
| F | F | T  | T  | F      | F      | T         |

3. **Analyze the results**:
   - The column for I ≡ ~H shows the truth values: F, T, T, F.
   - The column for ~(~I ≡ H) shows the truth values: F, T, F, T.
   - We can see that the truth values for I ≡ ~H and ~(~I ≡ H) do not match in all cases. 

4. **Determine the relationship**:
   - Since the truth values are not the same for all combinations, the two statements are not logically equivalent.
   - They also do not contradict each other, as there are instances where both can be true (e.g., when I is true and H is false).
   - Therefore, they are consistent because there are scenarios where both can be true at the same time.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine whether the set of propositions is consistent, I will analyze the propositions step by step.

1. The propositions are:
   - (T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U)
   - T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X)
   - (T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W

2. I will check the consistency of the propositions by trying to find a valuation that satisfies all of them. 

3. Let's evaluate the choices provided:
   - For choice b) U, W, and X are true and T is false:
     - (T ⊃ U) becomes (false ⊃ true) which is true.
     - (W ⊃ U) becomes (true ⊃ true) which is true.
     - Therefore, (T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U) is true.
     - T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X) becomes (false ⊃ false) which is true.
     - (T ⊃ ~X) becomes (false ⊃ false) which is true, so (T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W becomes (true ⊃ true) which is true.
     - All propositions are satisfied, so this valuation is consistent.

   - For choice c) W and X are true and T and U are false:
     - (T ⊃ U) becomes (false ⊃ false) which is true.
     - (W ⊃ U) becomes (true ⊃ false) which is false.
     - Therefore, (T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U) is false, making this valuation inconsistent.

   - For choice d) T and U are true and W and X are false:
     - (T ⊃ U) becomes (true ⊃ true) which is true.
     - (W ⊃ U) becomes (false ⊃ true) which is true.
     - Therefore, (T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U) is true.
     - T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X) becomes (true ⊃ ~(true ⊃ false)) which is (true ⊃ true) which is true.
     - (T ⊃ ~X) becomes (true ⊃ true) which is true, so (T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W becomes (true ⊃ false) which is false.
     - This valuation is inconsistent.

Since choice b) provides a consistent valuation, the answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To translate the statement ""Caroline is sweet if, and only if, Janet is engaged to Brad"" into predicate logic, we need to identify the components of the statement:

1. ""Caroline is sweet"" can be represented as S(c), where S is the predicate for ""is sweet"" and c represents Caroline.
2. ""Janet is engaged to Brad"" can be represented as E(j, b), where E is the predicate for ""is engaged to"" and j represents Janet while b represents Brad.

The phrase ""if, and only if"" indicates a biconditional relationship, which is represented by the symbol ""≡"" in predicate logic. Therefore, we can express the entire statement as:

S(c) ≡ E(j, b)

Now, let's analyze the options:

a) Cs ⊃ Ej - This represents ""If Caroline is sweet, then Janet is engaged to Brad,"" which is not a biconditional.
b) Sc ≡ Ej - This is a correct representation of the biconditional relationship.
c) sC ≡ eJ - This uses different symbols and is not standard notation.
d) Sx ≡ Jy - This uses variables that do not correspond to the specific individuals mentioned.

The best translation into predicate logic is option b.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the best symbolization of the given sentence, I will break down the components of the sentence and analyze the logical structure.

1. The sentence has two main parts connected by ""or"" (disjunction):
   - ""England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture"" can be symbolized as \( E \supset F \).
   - ""China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds"" can be symbolized as \( ~C \equiv S \).

2. The logical structure indicates that we have a disjunction (either/or) between the two parts. Therefore, the overall structure can be represented as:
   - \( (E \supset F) \lor (~C \equiv S) \).

3. Now, I will compare this structure with the provided options:
   - a) \( (E \supset F) \lor (~C \supset S) \) - This does not match because it incorrectly uses implication instead of equivalence for the second part.
   - b) \( (F \supset E) \lor (S \supset ~C) \) - This does not match because it reverses the implications and does not represent the original meaning.
   - c) \( (E \supset F) \lor \sim(S \equiv C) \) - This does not match because it incorrectly negates the equivalence.
   - d) \( (E \supset F) \lor (~C \equiv S) \) - This matches the structure we derived.

Thus, the best symbolization of the sentence is option d.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To translate the formula (~A ∨ ~B) ⊃ C into natural English sentences, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the components of the formula:
   - ~A means ""Marina does not read a Percy Jackson book.""
   - ~B means ""Izzy does not play Minecraft.""
   - C means ""Emily stops working.""
   - The symbol ∨ represents ""or,"" and ⊃ represents ""entails"" or ""implies.""

2. The expression (~A ∨ ~B) means ""Either Marina does not read a Percy Jackson book or Izzy does not play Minecraft."" 

3. The entire formula (~A ∨ ~B) ⊃ C translates to ""If either Marina does not read a Percy Jackson book or Izzy does not play Minecraft, then Emily stops working.""

Now, I will compare this translation with the provided choices:

a) If neither Marina reads a Percy Jackson book nor Izzy plays Minecraft, then Emily stops working. (This is incorrect because it suggests both are not happening, not just one.)

b) If it's not the case that both Marina reads a Percy Jackson book and Izzy plays Minecraft, then Emily stops working. (This is a bit convoluted but captures the essence of the implication.)

c) Either Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft entails that Emily stops working. (This is a direct translation of the formula.)

d) Emily stopping working is a sufficient condition for either Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft. (This is incorrect because it reverses the implication.)

The best match for the translation is option c.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To identify the conclusion of the argument, I will analyze the statements provided. 

1. The first statement discusses the existence of predicate variables and their values being attributes. This sets the stage but does not serve as a conclusion.
2. The second statement mentions that predicates are desired in all sentences, which is another assertion but not a conclusion.
3. The third statement introduces the dummy predicate 'F' for expository purposes, which again is an assertion rather than a conclusion.
4. The fourth statement presents a conditional that emphasizes the importance of clarity when quantifying over attributes, suggesting a specific action to take for clarity.

The fourth statement is the most comprehensive and prescriptive, indicating a conclusion drawn from the preceding statements about the need for clarity in the use of variables and predicates.

Therefore, the conclusion of the argument is: {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to translate the given formula ~C ∨ D into natural language. The symbol ""~"" represents negation, meaning ""not,"" and ""∨"" represents disjunction, meaning ""or."" 

1. The formula ~C means ""Emily does not stop working.""
2. The formula D means ""Russell makes dinner.""
3. The disjunction ~C ∨ D translates to ""Either Emily does not stop working or Russell makes dinner.""

Next, I will analyze the choices to find the one that matches this translation:

a) ""If Emily doesn't stop working then Russell makes dinner."" - This implies a conditional relationship, which is not what the original formula states.

b) ""Emily stops working unless Russell makes dinner."" - This suggests that Emily will stop working if Russell does not make dinner, which is not equivalent to the original formula.

c) ""Emily stops working unless Russell doesn't make dinner."" - This is also not equivalent to the original formula.

d) ""Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner."" - This means that if Russell does not make dinner, then Emily will not stop working, which aligns with the original formula.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To translate the statement ""Abdul and Cleopatra are Egyptian"" into predicate logic, I need to identify the correct representation of the statement.

1. The statement involves two specific individuals: Abdul and Cleopatra. In predicate logic, we can represent these individuals with constants, such as ""a"" for Abdul and ""c"" for Cleopatra.
2. The phrase ""are Egyptian"" can be represented by a predicate, let's say ""E(x)"" which means ""x is Egyptian.""
3. Since both Abdul and Cleopatra are Egyptian, I need to express that both individuals satisfy the predicate E. This can be done using the conjunction operator (•) to indicate that both conditions must be true.

Now, I can evaluate the options:
- a) Ea • Ec: This means ""Abdul is Egyptian and Cleopatra is Egyptian,"" which correctly represents the statement.
- b) Ea • c: This is not a valid representation as it mixes a predicate with a constant incorrectly.
- c) Ae ∨ Ce: This means ""Abdul is Egyptian or Cleopatra is Egyptian,"" which does not accurately reflect the original statement since it suggests that at least one of them is Egyptian, rather than both.
- d) Ex • Ey: This suggests that there exist some individuals x and y such that both are Egyptian, which is not specific to Abdul and Cleopatra.

Based on this analysis, the best translation into predicate logic is option a) Ea • Ec.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To translate the statement ""Sheena is a punk rocker"" into predicate logic, we need to identify the subject and the predicate. 

1. The subject here is ""Sheena,"" which we can denote as 's'.
2. The predicate is ""is a punk rocker,"" which we can denote as 'P'.

In predicate logic, we typically use a predicate followed by the subject. Therefore, the correct representation would be 'Ps', meaning ""Punk Rocker (P) is true for Sheena (s).""

Now, let's evaluate the options:
- a) Sx: This does not represent the statement correctly.
- b) xS: This also does not represent the statement correctly.
- c) sP: This does not represent the statement correctly.
- d) Ps: This correctly represents ""Sheena is a punk rocker.""

Thus, the best translation into predicate logic is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To translate the statement ""Kevin is introduced to José by Wilma"" into predicate logic, we need to identify the roles of each individual in the introduction. 

1. **Identify the roles**: 
   - Wilma (w) is the one doing the introducing.
   - Kevin (k) is the one being introduced.
   - José (j) is the one to whom Kevin is being introduced.

2. **Determine the order of the arguments in the predicate**: 
   The predicate Ixyz indicates that x introduces y to z. In this case:
   - x = Wilma (w)
   - y = Kevin (k)
   - z = José (j)

3. **Construct the logical expression**: 
   Following the structure of the predicate, we have:
   - Wilma introduces Kevin to José, which translates to Iwkj.

Thus, the best translation into predicate logic is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To translate the statement ""If Eileen plays fiddle then Sherri sings"" into predicate logic, I need to identify the components of the statement.

1. The statement is a conditional statement, which typically takes the form ""If P then Q."" In this case, P is ""Eileen plays fiddle"" and Q is ""Sherri sings.""
2. I will denote ""Eileen plays fiddle"" as Fe and ""Sherri sings"" as Ss.
3. The correct logical form for a conditional statement is represented by the implication symbol (⊃), which means ""if...then.""

Putting this together, the correct translation of the statement is Fe ⊃ Ss.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To construct a truth table for the argument, we need to evaluate the premises and the conclusion. The premises are:

1. ~C ⊃ D (If not C, then D)
2. D ⊃ C (If D, then C)

The conclusion is:

C

We will evaluate the truth values of C and D, and then determine the truth values of the premises and the conclusion.

Let's create the truth table:

| C | D | ~C | ~C ⊃ D | D ⊃ C | C |
|---|---|----|--------|-------|---|
| T | T | F  |   T    |   T   | T |
| T | F | F  |   T    |   T   | T |
| F | T | T  |   T    |   F   | F |
| F | F | T  |   F    |   T   | F |

Now, we analyze the rows of the truth table:

1. In the first row (C = T, D = T), both premises are true, and the conclusion is true.
2. In the second row (C = T, D = F), both premises are true, and the conclusion is true.
3. In the third row (C = F, D = T), the first premise is true, but the second premise is false, and the conclusion is false.
4. In the fourth row (C = F, D = F), the first premise is false, the second premise is true, and the conclusion is false.

The argument is valid if whenever the premises are true, the conclusion is also true. However, we see that there are cases (specifically the third row) where the premises can be true, but the conclusion is false. This indicates that the argument is invalid.

Now, we need to find a counterexample. The third row provides a counterexample where C is false and D is true, which shows that the premises can be true while the conclusion is false.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To translate the statement ""Some blue herons migrate"" into predicate logic, I need to identify the components of the statement:

1. ""Some blue herons"" indicates that there exists at least one blue heron. This suggests the use of the existential quantifier (∃).
2. ""migrate"" indicates that this blue heron has the property of migrating.

Now, let's analyze the options:

a) (∀x)(Hx • Bx) • Mx: This states that for all x, if x is a heron and blue, then x migrates. This is too strong because it implies all blue herons migrate, not just some.

b) (∃x)(Hx • Bx) ⊃ Mx: This states that if there exists an x such that x is a heron and blue, then x migrates. This is not correct because it implies that the existence of a blue heron guarantees migration, which is not what the original statement says.

c) (∀x)(Hx • Bx) ⊃ Mx: This states that if all x are herons and blue, then x migrates. This is also too strong and does not reflect the original statement.

d) (∃x)(Hx • Bx) • Mx: This states that there exists an x such that x is a heron and blue, and x migrates. This correctly captures the meaning of ""some blue herons migrate.""

Therefore, the best translation into predicate logic is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To interpret the given arguments in predicate logic, I will analyze each part step by step.

1. The first part of the argument, (∃x)(Cx • Ox), translates to ""Some cookies (Cx) have oatmeal (Ox)."" This indicates that there exists at least one cookie that has oatmeal.

2. The second part, (∀x)[(~Cx ⊃ ~Bx) ⊃ ~Og], can be broken down as follows:
   - The expression ~Cx means ""not a cookie.""
   - The expression ~Bx means ""not having chocolate chips.""
   - The implication ~Cx ⊃ ~Bx means ""if something is not a cookie, then it does not have chocolate chips.""
   - The outer implication states that if the above condition holds, then ~Og means ""it does not have oatmeal.""

3. The conclusion ~Og indicates that the specific cookie in question does not have oatmeal.

Now, I will evaluate the choices based on this interpretation:

a) This choice states that if something's not being a cookie entails that it doesn't have chocolate chips, then this cookie doesn't have oatmeal. This is a misinterpretation of the logic.

b) This choice correctly states that if something is not a cookie and does not have chocolate chips, it doesn't have oatmeal. It also concludes that this cookie doesn't have oatmeal. This aligns with the logical structure.

c) This choice misinterprets the implications and does not accurately reflect the logical structure.

d) This choice also misinterprets the implications and does not accurately reflect the logical structure.

After analyzing the choices, the best interpretation is option b.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To identify the conclusion of the argument, I will analyze the statements provided. 

1. The first statement asserts that ""All of psychology has gotten stuck in moral prejudices and fears,"" which sets the context for the argument but does not serve as a conclusion.
2. The second statement claims that ""No one has come close to understanding it as the development of the will to power,"" which also serves as a premise rather than a conclusion.
3. The third statement discusses the effects of negative emotions and how they lead to a feeling of seasickness, indicating a process rather than a conclusion.
4. The fourth statement, ""Psychology becomes again the path to fundamental problems,"" suggests a resolution or outcome of the preceding discussion, indicating a shift in understanding psychology.

Based on this analysis, the conclusion of the argument is best represented by the last statement. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine whether the set of propositions is consistent, I will analyze the propositions step by step.

1. The propositions are:
   - \( \sim N \equiv (O \cdot P) \)
   - \( \sim O \supset Q \)
   - \( N \cdot \sim Q \)

2. Let's rewrite the propositions for clarity:
   - \( \sim N \) is true if \( N \) is false, and \( O \cdot P \) is true if both \( O \) and \( P \) are true.
   - \( \sim O \supset Q \) means if \( O \) is false, then \( Q \) must be true.
   - \( N \cdot \sim Q \) means \( N \) is true and \( Q \) is false.

3. Now, let's check the consistency of the propositions:
   - If \( N \) is true, then \( \sim N \) is false. Therefore, \( O \cdot P \) must also be false, which means at least one of \( O \) or \( P \) is false.
   - If \( O \) is false, then from \( \sim O \supset Q \), \( Q \) must be true. However, this contradicts \( N \cdot \sim Q \) since \( Q \) cannot be both true and false.
   - Therefore, \( O \) must be true, which means \( P \) must be false (since \( O \cdot P \) is false).

4. Now we have:
   - \( N \) is true
   - \( O \) is true
   - \( P \) is false
   - \( Q \) must be false (from \( N \cdot \sim Q \))

5. This gives us a consistent valuation: \( N = T, O = T, P = F, Q = F \).

Now, let's check the options:
- a) Inconsistent - This is incorrect as we found a consistent valuation.
- b) Consistent. Consistent valuation when N, O, and P are true and Q is false - This is incorrect because \( P \) cannot be true.
- c) Consistent. Consistent valuation when N and O are true and P and Q are false - This is correct as it matches our findings.
- d) Consistent. Consistent valuation when N and P are true and O and Q are false - This is incorrect because \( O \) cannot be false.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the best symbolization of the given sentence, I will analyze the components of the statement step by step.

1. The sentence states that a person is considered to have lived with you for the entire present year if two conditions are met: 
   - The person was either born (B) or died (D) in the present year.
   - Your home (H) was this person's home for the entire time they were alive (L).

2. The logical structure of the statement suggests that if the person meets the conditions of being born or dying in the present year and having your home as their home, then they can be considered to have lived with you for the entire year. This indicates a conditional relationship.

3. The correct logical representation should reflect that if the person has lived with you (L), then it must be true that either they were born or died in the present year (B ∨ D) and that your home was their home (H).

Now, let's evaluate the options:
- a) (B ∨ D) • H ⊃ L: This suggests that if the person was born or died and your home was their home, then they lived with you, which is not the correct interpretation.
- b) L ⊃ (B ∨ D) • H: This suggests that if the person lived with you, then they were born or died and your home was their home, which is the correct interpretation.
- c) L ⊃ (B ∨ D) • H: This is identical to option b and is also correct.
- d) (B ∨ D • H) ⊃ L: This suggests that if the person was born or died and your home was their home, then they lived with you, which is incorrect.

Since options b and c are identical and correctly represent the statement, I will choose one of them. 

Therefore, the best symbolization of the sentence is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the validity of the argument (O ≡ P) ∨ P / P ∨ ~O, I will construct a truth table for the premises and the conclusion.

1. **Identify the components**:
   - O
   - P
   - O ≡ P (O if and only if P)
   - (O ≡ P) ∨ P (Premise)
   - ~O (not O)
   - P ∨ ~O (Conclusion)

2. **Construct the truth table**:

| O | P | O ≡ P | (O ≡ P) ∨ P | ~O | P ∨ ~O |
|---|---|-------|--------------|----|--------|
| T | T |   T   |      T       |  F |   T    |
| T | F |   F   |      F       |  F |   F    |
| F | T |   F   |      T       |  T |   T    |
| F | F |   T   |      T       |  T |   T    |

3. **Analyze the truth table**:
   - The premise (O ≡ P) ∨ P is true in the following cases:
     - When O is true and P is true (Row 1)
     - When O is false and P is true (Row 3)
     - When O is false and P is false (Row 4)
   - The conclusion P ∨ ~O is true in the following cases:
     - When O is true and P is true (Row 1)
     - When O is false and P is true (Row 3)
     - When O is false and P is false (Row 4)

4. **Determine validity**:
   - The argument is valid if every time the premise is true, the conclusion is also true.
   - In Row 2, the premise is false (F) and the conclusion is false (F), which does not affect validity.
   - However, in Row 4, the premise is true (T) and the conclusion is true (T).
   - The only case where the premise is true and the conclusion is false does not exist, thus the argument is valid.

Since the argument is valid, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To translate the statement ""Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name"" into predicate logic, we need to understand the structure of the statement. 

1. The phrase ""only if"" indicates a conditional relationship. Specifically, ""A only if B"" translates to ""If A, then B"" or ""A ⊃ B"". In this case, we can let:
   - Bl represent ""Leroy is bad""
   - Sk represent ""DJ Khaled shouts Leroy's name""

2. Therefore, the statement ""Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name"" can be expressed as:
   - Bl ⊃ Sk (If Leroy is bad, then DJ Khaled shouts his name).

3. Now, we can look at the options provided:
   - a) Sk ≡ Bl (This means Sk is equivalent to Bl, which is not correct)
   - b) Bl ≡ Sk (This means Bl is equivalent to Sk, which is also not correct)
   - c) Bx ⊃ Sy (This is a general form and does not specifically relate to Leroy and DJ Khaled)
   - d) Bl ⊃ Sk (This correctly represents the statement)

Thus, the best translation into predicate logic is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the best symbolization of the sentence ""If either George enrolls or Harry enrolls, then Ira does not enroll,"" I will break it down step by step.

1. The phrase ""either George enrolls or Harry enrolls"" can be represented as a disjunction: \( G \lor H \). This indicates that at least one of them (George or Harry) is enrolling.

2. The phrase ""then Ira does not enroll"" indicates a conditional relationship. The negation of Ira enrolling can be represented as \( \sim I \).

3. The entire sentence can be structured as a conditional statement where the antecedent is the disjunction \( G \lor H \) and the consequent is the negation \( \sim I \). Therefore, the correct representation of the entire statement is \( (G \lor H) \supset \sim I \).

Now, looking at the choices provided:
- a) \( (G \supset H) \lor I \) - Incorrect structure.
- b) \( (G \lor H) \supset I \) - Incorrect because it states that if either enrolls, then Ira enrolls.
- c) \( (G \supset H) \lor \sim I \) - Incorrect structure.
- d) \( (G \lor H) \supset \sim I \) - This matches our derived structure.

Thus, the best symbolization of the sentence is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To translate the statement ""Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar, but neither Janet nor Latoya did"" into predicate logic, I will break it down step by step.

1. Identify the components of the statement:
   - ""Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar"" can be represented as \( Lm \).
   - ""Janet lent me some sugar"" can be represented as \( Lj \).
   - ""Latoya lent me some sugar"" can be represented as \( Ll \).
   - The phrase ""neither Janet nor Latoya did"" indicates that both Janet and Latoya did not lend sugar, which can be expressed as \( \neg Lj \) and \( \neg Ll \).

2. Combine the components:
   - The phrase ""but neither Janet nor Latoya did"" suggests a conjunction (AND) of the two negations: \( \neg Lj \) and \( \neg Ll \). This can be expressed as \( \neg Lj \land \neg Ll \).

3. Formulate the complete expression:
   - The complete statement can be expressed as \( Lm \land (\neg Lj \land \neg Ll) \). This can be simplified using logical equivalences to \( Lm \land \neg (Lj \lor Ll) \).

Now, looking at the options provided:
- a) \( Lm \lor \neg (Jl \lor Ll) \) - Incorrect, as it uses OR instead of AND.
- b) \( Lm \land \neg (Lj \land Ll) \) - Incorrect, as it incorrectly combines the negation.
- c) \( Lm \land \neg (Lj \lor Ll) \) - Correct, as it accurately represents the statement.
- d) \( Lm \lor \neg (Lj \land Ll) \) - Incorrect, as it uses OR instead of AND.

Thus, the best translation into predicate logic is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To translate the statement ""Some animals are neglected by cruel people"" into predicate logic, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the components of the statement: We have ""some animals,"" ""neglected,"" and ""cruel people."" This indicates that there exists at least one animal and at least one cruel person involved in the neglect.

2. Determine the logical structure: The statement suggests that there exists an animal (let's call it x) and a cruel person (let's call it y) such that the person y neglects the animal x. This can be expressed as (∃x)(∃y)(Ax • Cy • Nxy).

3. Analyze the answer choices: I need to find the option that correctly captures the existence of both an animal and a cruel person, along with the neglect relationship.

Now, let's evaluate the choices:

a) (∃x)(Ax • Cx) • (∃y)(Py • Nyx) - This suggests that there exists an animal that is cruel, and a person that neglects that animal, which is not the correct interpretation.

b) (∃x)(Cx • Px) • (∃y)(Ay • Nxy) - This suggests that there exists a cruel person and a person that neglects an animal, which is not the correct interpretation.

c) (∃x)(Ax • Px) • (∃y)(Cy • Nxy) - This suggests that there exists an animal and a person, and a cruel person neglects that animal, which is not the correct interpretation.

d) (∃x)(∃y){(Ax • Cy) • Py • Nxy)} - This correctly states that there exists an animal (x) and a cruel person (y) such that the person y neglects the animal x.

Thus, the best translation into predicate logic is option d.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine whether the set of propositions is consistent, I will analyze the propositions step by step.

1. **Identify the propositions**:
   - (E ⊃ F) ⊃ G
   - (~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I)
   - I ⊃ (J ⊃ ~H)
   - ~G ⊃ ~J

2. **Assume a valuation**:
   Let's evaluate the options provided. I will start with option b) where E is true and F, G, H, I, and J are false.

3. **Evaluate the propositions under this valuation**:
   - For (E ⊃ F) ⊃ G:
     - E is true, F is false, so E ⊃ F is false. Therefore, (E ⊃ F) ⊃ G is true (since false implies anything is true).
   - For (~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I):
     - ~E is false (since E is true), F is false, so ~E ∨ F is false. H is false, I is false, so H ∨ I is false. Therefore, this equivalence is true (false ≡ false).
   - For I ⊃ (J ⊃ ~H):
     - I is false, so I ⊃ (J ⊃ ~H) is true (since false implies anything is true).
   - For ~G ⊃ ~J:
     - G is false, so ~G is true. J is false, so ~J is true. Therefore, ~G ⊃ ~J is true (true implies true).

Since all propositions evaluate to true under this valuation, the set is consistent.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To translate the statement ""Some students work hard"" into predicate logic, I need to identify the components of the statement. 

1. The phrase ""Some students"" indicates that there exists at least one student, which is represented by the existential quantifier (∃x).
2. The term ""work hard"" can be represented by a predicate, say Wx, where x is a student.
3. The logical structure of the statement suggests that there is a relationship between being a student and working hard, which means we need to express that there exists a student who works hard.

Now, let's analyze the options:

a) (∃x)(Wx ∨ Sx) - This suggests that there exists an x such that x works hard or x is a student, which does not capture the original meaning correctly.

b) (∃x)(Sx ∨ Wx) - This suggests that there exists an x such that x is a student or x works hard, which also does not capture the original meaning correctly.

c) (∃x)(Sx • Wx) - This correctly states that there exists an x such that x is a student and x works hard, which aligns with the original statement.

d) (∃x)(Sx ⊃ Wx) - This suggests that if x is a student, then x works hard, which implies all students work hard, not just some.

Based on this analysis, the best translation into predicate logic is option c.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the best symbolization of the given sentence, I will break down the components of the sentence step by step.

1. The sentence states: ""Either England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds."" 
   - The first part, ""England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture,"" can be symbolized as (~F ⊃ E), meaning if France does not subsidize agriculture, then England does not import beef.
   - The second part, ""China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds,"" can be symbolized as (C ⊃ S), meaning if South Africa supplies diamonds, then China promotes human rights.

2. The overall structure of the sentence is an ""either/or"" statement, which indicates a disjunction (∨). Therefore, we combine the two parts with a disjunction: (~F ⊃ E) ∨ (C ⊃ S).

3. Now, I will compare this with the provided options:
   - a) (~F ⊃ E) ∨ (C ≡ ~S) - This includes a biconditional which is not present in the original sentence.
   - b) (~E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ⊃ S) - This incorrectly represents the first part.
   - c) (~F ⊃ E) ∨ (C ≡ S) - This includes a biconditional which is not present in the original sentence.
   - d) ~(F ⊃ E) ∨ (S ⊃ C) - This incorrectly represents the first part and the order of implications.

The correct representation based on the breakdown is: (~F ⊃ E) ∨ (C ⊃ S), which matches option b.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the validity of the argument using a truth table, we will analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.

1. **Identify the components**: We have three variables: A, B, and C. The premises are ~A · ~B and (A ∨ C) ∨ B, and the conclusion is C.

2. **Construct the truth table**: We will evaluate the truth values for all combinations of A, B, and C.

| A | B | C | ~A | ~B | ~A · ~B | A ∨ C | (A ∨ C) ∨ B | C |
|---|---|---|----|----|---------|-------|--------------|---|
| T | T | T | F  | F  | F       | T     | T            | T |
| T | T | F | F  | F  | F       | T     | T            | F |

| T | F | F | F  | T  | F       | T     | T            | F |
| F | T | T | T  | F  | F       | T     | T            | T |
| F | T | F | T  | F  | F       | F     | T            | F |
| F | F | T | T  | T  | T       | T     | T            | T |
| F | F | F | T  | T  | T       | F     | F            | F |

3. **Analyze the truth table**: 
   - The argument is valid if whenever the premises are true, the conclusion is also true.
   - The premises are true when:
     - Row 7: A = F, B = F, C = T (premises true, conclusion true)
     - Row 1: A = T, B = T, C = T (premises false)
     - Row 2: A = T, B = T, C = F (premises false)
     - Row 3: A = T, B = F, C = T (premises false)
     - Row 4: A = T, B = F, C = F (premises false)
     - Row 5: A = F, B = T, C = T (premises false)
     - Row 6: A = F, B = T, C = F (premises false)
     - Row 8: A = F, B = F, C = F (premises true, conclusion false)

   - In Row 8, the premises are true (~A · ~B is true and (A ∨ C) ∨ B is false), but the conclusion C is false. This indicates that the argument is invalid.

4. **Identify a counterexample**: The counterexample from Row 8 shows that when A is false, B is false, and C is false, the premises are true while the conclusion is false.

Thus, the argument is invalid, and a counterexample is when A is false, B is false, and C is false.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To translate the statement ""All birds live in some nest"" into predicate logic, I need to break down the components of the statement.

1. The phrase ""All birds"" indicates that we are dealing with a universal quantifier (∀) for birds (Bx).
2. The phrase ""live in some nest"" indicates that for each bird, there exists at least one nest (Ny) such that the bird lives in that nest (Lxy). This suggests the use of an existential quantifier (∃).

Now, I can analyze the choices:

a) (∀x)(∀y)(Bx • Ny) ⊃ Lxy: This suggests that for all x and all y, if x is a bird and y is a nest, then x lives in y. This is too strong because it implies every bird lives in every nest.

b) (∀x)Bx ⊃ (∃y)(Ny • Lxy): This states that if x is a bird, then there exists a y such that y is a nest and x lives in y. This correctly captures the meaning of the original statement.

c) (∀x)(∃y)(Ny • Bx) ⊃ Lxy: This suggests that for every x, there exists a y such that y is a nest and x is a bird, which does not correctly represent the original statement.

d) (∀x)(∃y)(Bx • Ny) ⊃ Lxy: This suggests that for every x, there exists a y such that x is a bird and y is a nest, which does not correctly represent the original statement.

After analyzing the options, the best translation is option b.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To identify the conclusion of the argument, I will analyze the statements provided. 

1. The first statement indicates that utilitarian theory is embarrassed by the possibility of utility monsters, which sets the stage for the argument.
2. The second statement describes what a utility monster is, specifically that it gains enormous utility.
3. The third statement elaborates on the implications of a utility monster's utility gains, stating that these gains are greater than the utility lost by the sacrifices of others.
4. The fourth statement concludes that the sacrifices of many people are outweighed by the utility monster's gains, leading to the troubling implication that utilitarianism would require sacrificing individuals for the monster's benefit.

The conclusion of the argument is that utilitarian theory faces a significant problem due to the existence of utility monsters, as it suggests that the theory would demand sacrifices for the sake of maximizing total utility.

Thus, the conclusion is best captured by the first statement: ""Utilitarian theory is embarrassed by the possibility of utility monsters.""

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To translate the given formula (A ∨ ~E) ≡ (D • ~B) into natural English sentences, I will break it down step by step.

1. The left side of the equivalence (A ∨ ~E) means ""Either Marina reads a Percy Jackson book (A) or Ashleigh does not stop by (~E).""
2. The right side of the equivalence (D • ~B) means ""Russell makes dinner (D) and Izzy does not play Minecraft (~B).""
3. The equivalence (≡) indicates that both sides are logically equivalent, meaning that the truth of one side guarantees the truth of the other side.

Now, I will analyze the choices:
- Choice a) suggests a necessary condition, which does not align with the equivalence.
- Choice b) suggests a necessary and sufficient condition, which is not accurate since the equivalence does not imply that one side is sufficient for the other.
- Choice c) uses ""unless,"" which does not accurately reflect the logical structure of the equivalence.
- Choice d) correctly states that ""Either Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh does not stop by just in case both Russell makes dinner and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft,"" which aligns with the equivalence.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the best symbolization of the sentence ""Brittany likes fish and lizards, but not cats,"" I will analyze the components of the sentence step by step.

1. The phrase ""Brittany likes fish and lizards"" indicates that both conditions must be true. In propositional logic, this can be represented as F (for fish) and L (for lizards), which can be combined using the conjunction operator (•). Therefore, this part can be symbolized as F • L.

2. The phrase ""but not cats"" indicates that Brittany does not like cats. This can be represented as ~C (not C).

3. The conjunction ""and"" in the context of the sentence suggests that both conditions (liking fish and lizards, and not liking cats) must hold true simultaneously. Therefore, we need to combine the two parts: (F • L) and ~C.

Putting it all together, the best symbolization of the entire sentence is (F • L) • ~C.

Now, I will check the options:
- a) F • L • ~C: This is equivalent to (F • L) • ~C, but it is not the best representation in terms of clarity.
- b) (F • L) • ~C: This is the correct representation.
- c) (F • L) ∨ ~C: This suggests that either Brittany likes fish and lizards or does not like cats, which is not accurate.
- d) C • (F • L): This suggests that Brittany likes cats and also likes fish and lizards, which contradicts the original statement.

Thus, the best symbolization is option b.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the best symbolization of the sentence ""If either Harry enrolls or George does not enroll, then Jim enrolls,"" I will break it down step by step.

1. Identify the components of the sentence:
   - ""Harry enrolls"" can be represented as H.
   - ""George does not enroll"" can be represented as ~G.
   - ""Jim enrolls"" can be represented as J.

2. The phrase ""either Harry enrolls or George does not enroll"" indicates a disjunction, which can be symbolized as (H ∨ ~G).

3. The phrase ""then Jim enrolls"" indicates a conditional relationship, which can be symbolized as ⊃ J.

4. Putting it all together, the entire sentence can be symbolized as: If (H ∨ ~G), then J, which is represented as (H ∨ ~G) ⊃ J.

Now, I will compare this with the provided options:
- a) H ∨ (~G ⊃ J) - This does not match our derived formula.
- b) ~(H ∨ G) ⊃ J - This does not match our derived formula.
- c) (H ∨ ~G) ⊃ J - This matches our derived formula.
- d) (H ⊃ ~G) ∨ J - This does not match our derived formula.

The correct answer is option c) (H ∨ ~G) ⊃ J.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the validity of the argument using a truth table, we will analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.

1. **Identify the premises and conclusion**:
   - Premise 1: ~X ⊃ Y
   - Premise 2: Y ⊃ Z
   - Conclusion: ~Z

2. **Construct the truth table**:
   We will evaluate the truth values for X, Y, and Z, and then determine the truth values for the premises and the conclusion.

| X | Y | Z | ~X | ~Z | ~X ⊃ Y | Y ⊃ Z | Conclusion ~Z |
|---|---|---|----|----|--------|--------|----------------|
| T | T | T | F  | F  | T      | T      | F              |
| T | T | F | F  | T  | T      | F      | T              |
| T | F | T | F  | F  | T      | T      | F              |
| T | F | F | F  | T  | T      | T      | T              |
| F | T | T | T  | F  | T      | T      | F              |
| F | T | F | T  | T  | T      | F      | T              |
| F | F | T | T  | F  | F      | T      | F              |
| F | F | F | T  | T  | T      | T      | T              |

3. **Analyze the truth table**:
   - The argument is valid if whenever both premises are true, the conclusion is also true.
   - From the truth table, we can see that there are rows where both premises are true but the conclusion is false.

4. **Identify counterexamples**:
   - In the second row (X = T, Y = T, Z = F), both premises are true (~X ⊃ Y is true because F ⊃ T is true, and Y ⊃ Z is true because T ⊃ F is false), but the conclusion ~Z is true (since Z is false).
   - In the sixth row (X = F, Y = T, Z = F), both premises are true (~X ⊃ Y is true because T ⊃ T is true, and Y ⊃ Z is false), but the conclusion ~Z is true (since Z is false).

Since we found instances where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.

The correct answer is: {'sol': 'b'}."
"To translate the statement ""Some kind people help some endangered species"" into predicate logic, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the components of the statement:
   - ""Some kind people"" indicates the existence of at least one person who is kind.
   - ""help"" indicates a relationship between the person and the species.
   - ""some endangered species"" indicates the existence of at least one species that is endangered.

2. Define the predicates:
   - Kx: x is kind
   - Px: x is a person
   - Sy: y is a species
   - Ey: y is endangered
   - Hxy: x helps y

3. Construct the logical expression:
   - We need to express that there exists a person x who is kind and there exists a species y that is endangered, and that x helps y. This can be represented as:
   - (∃x)(∃y){(Kx • Px) • (Ey • Sy) • Hxy}

Now, I will evaluate the options:
- Option a) (∃x){(Kx • Px) • (∃y)(Ey • Sy) • Hxy} - This suggests that there is one specific person who helps all endangered species, which is not correct.
- Option b) (∃x)(∃y){(Kx • Sx) • (Ey • Py) • Hxy} - This incorrectly uses Sx for species instead of Sy and suggests that y is a person, which is incorrect.
- Option c) (∃x)(∃y){(Kx • Sx) • (Ey • Py) • Hyx} - This also incorrectly uses Sx for species and suggests that y is a person, which is incorrect.
- Option d) (∃x)(∃y){(Kx • Px) • (Ey • Sy) ⊃ Hxy} - This suggests that if x is a kind person and y is an endangered species, then x helps y, which is not the same as stating that they do help.

The correct translation is option a) because it correctly captures the meaning of the original statement.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To interpret the given proposition (∀x)[Ax ⊃ (∃y)(Hy • Bxy)], I will break it down step by step.

1. The outer quantifier (∀x) indicates that the statement applies to all entities x in the domain. The expression Ax indicates that x is an apartment.

2. The implication (Ax ⊃ ...) means that if x is an apartment, then the statement that follows must be true. The statement that follows is (∃y)(Hy • Bxy), which means ""there exists some entity y such that y is a house (Hy) and x is bigger than y (Bxy).""

3. Putting this together, the proposition states that for every apartment x, there exists at least one house y such that x is bigger than that house. This translates to: ""Every apartment is bigger than some house.""

Now, I will compare this interpretation with the provided choices:

a) Every apartment is bigger than some house. (This matches our interpretation.)
b) Every house is bigger than all apartments. (This is not correct.)
c) Every house is bigger than some apartment. (This is not correct.)
d) Some house is bigger than every apartment. (This is not correct.)

The best English interpretation of the given proposition is therefore option a.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To construct a truth table for the argument \( Q \equiv R \) and \( \neg(S \lor Q) \) leading to \( R \), we will evaluate all possible truth values for \( Q \), \( R \), and \( S \).

1. **Identify the components**:
   - \( Q \equiv R \) means \( Q \) is true if and only if \( R \) is true.
   - \( \neg(S \lor Q) \) means that neither \( S \) nor \( Q \) is true.

2. **Construct the truth table**:

| Q | R | S | S ∨ Q | ¬(S ∨ Q) | Q ≡ R |
|---|---|---|-------|----------|-------|
| T | T | T |   T   |    F     |   T   |
| T | T | F |   T   |    F     |   T   |
| T | F | T |   T   |    F     |   F   |
| T | F | F |   T   |    F     |   F   |
| F | T | T |   T   |    F     |   F   |
| F | T | F |   F   |    T     |   F   |
| F | F | T |   T   |    F     |   T   |
| F | F | F |   F   |    T     |   T   |

3. **Analyze the truth table**:
   - The argument is valid if whenever the premises are true, the conclusion is also true.
   - The premises are \( Q \equiv R \) and \( \neg(S \lor Q) \).
   - The conclusion is \( R \).

From the truth table, we can see the following rows where both premises are true:
- Row 6: \( Q = F, R = T, S = F \) → Premises are true, conclusion \( R \) is true.
- Row 8: \( Q = F, R = F, S = F \) → Premises are true, conclusion \( R \) is false.

Since there is a case (Row 8) where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.

4. **Identify a counterexample**:
   - In Row 8, \( Q \) is false, \( S \) is false, and \( R \) is false, which shows that the argument is invalid.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To identify the antecedent of the conditional proposition, I need to understand the structure of the statement. The statement ""The university raises tuition only if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it"" can be interpreted as a conditional statement where the condition (or antecedent) must be satisfied for the conclusion (or consequent) to hold true.

1. The phrase ""only if"" indicates that the first part of the statement is the condition that must be met for the second part to be true. In this case, the second part is ""The university raises tuition.""
2. The condition that must be satisfied is ""both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it."" This means that for the university to raise tuition, both of these conditions must be true.
3. Therefore, the antecedent of the proposition is the entire condition that must be satisfied, which is ""The governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it.""

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which proposition is an immediate consequence of the given premises, let's analyze the premises step by step.

1. The first premise is (A ∨ B) ⊃ (C ∨ D). This means if either A or B is true, then either C or D must also be true.
2. The second premise is A ∨ B, which states that either A is true, B is true, or both are true.
3. The third premise is ~C, which indicates that C is false.

Now, let's see how these premises interact:

- From the second premise (A ∨ B) and the first premise (A ∨ B) ⊃ (C ∨ D), we can conclude that since A ∨ B is true, (C ∨ D) must also be true. This means at least one of C or D is true.
- However, since we have the third premise ~C (C is false), the only possibility left is that D must be true.

Now, let's evaluate the choices:

a) ~A ∨ ~B: This does not follow directly from the premises.
b) ~~C: This is equivalent to C, which contradicts the third premise ~C.
c) C ∨ D: This cannot be concluded because C is false, but D is true, so this statement is not immediately valid.
d) (A ∨ B) ⊃ D: This is a valid conclusion because we have established that if A ∨ B is true, then D must also be true.

Thus, the immediate consequence of the premises is (A ∨ B) ⊃ D.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To identify the antecedent of the given conditional proposition, I need to understand the structure of a conditional statement, which is typically in the form ""If P, then Q."" 

1. In the provided statement, ""When the university raises tuition, then either the governor approves of it or the board of trustees doesn't prevent it,"" the phrase ""When the university raises tuition"" serves as the condition that triggers the outcome.
2. The outcome or consequent of this conditional statement is ""either the governor approves of it or the board of trustees doesn't prevent it.""
3. Therefore, the antecedent, which is the part that comes before the ""then"" (or in this case, ""when""), is ""the university raises tuition.""

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To translate the statement ""Marco doesn't move from Spain to Italy"" into predicate logic, we need to analyze the components:

1. The statement indicates that Marco (m) does not perform the action of moving from Spain (s) to Italy (i).
2. The predicate Mxyz represents the action of moving from z to y, where x is the subject. In this case, we are interested in the specific instance where Marco is the subject, Spain is the origin, and Italy is the destination.

Now, let's evaluate the choices:

- a) ~Mmsi: This translates to ""It is not the case that Marco moves from Spain to Italy."" This aligns with the original statement.
- b) M~mis: This would imply ""Marco moves from Spain to not Italy,"" which is not the same as not moving at all.
- c) ~Mmis: This would imply ""It is not the case that Marco moves from Spain to Italy,"" which is similar to option a but does not specify the destination.
- d) M~msi: This would imply ""Marco moves from Spain to not Italy,"" which is incorrect.

The best translation that accurately reflects the original statement is option a.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the validity of the argument using a truth table, we will analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.

1. **Identify the propositions**: We have three propositions: S, T, and U. The premises are:
   - Premise 1: ~S ∨ T
   - Premise 2: ~S · U
   - Conclusion: T · U

2. **Construct the truth table**: We will evaluate all possible truth values for S, T, and U (True or False).

| S | T | U | ~S | ~S ∨ T | ~S · U | T · U |
|---|---|---|----|--------|--------|-------|
| T | T | T | F  | T      | F      | T     |
| T | T | F | F  | T      | F      | F     |
| T | F | T | F  | F      | F      | F     |
| T | F | F | F  | F      | F      | F     |
| F | T | T | T  | T      | T      | T     |
| F | T | F | T  | T      | F      | F     |
| F | F | T | T  | T      | T      | F     |
| F | F | F | T  | T      | F      | F     |

3. **Analyze the truth table**: We need to check the rows where both premises are true and see if the conclusion is also true in those cases.

- **Row 5**: S = F, T = T, U = T
  - Premise 1: ~S ∨ T = T (True)
  - Premise 2: ~S · U = T (True)
  - Conclusion: T · U = T (True)

- **Row 6**: S = F, T = T, U = F
  - Premise 1: ~S ∨ T = T (True)
  - Premise 2: ~S · U = F (False)
  - Conclusion: T · U = F (False)

- **Row 7**: S = F, T = F, U = T
  - Premise 1: ~S ∨ T = T (True)
  - Premise 2: ~S · U = T (True)
  - Conclusion: T · U = F (False)

- **Row 8**: S = F, T = F, U = F
  - Premise 1: ~S ∨ T = T (True)
  - Premise 2: ~S · U = F (False)
  - Conclusion: T · U = F (False)

From the truth table, we see that there are cases (specifically Row 6, Row 7, and Row 8) where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. This indicates that the argument is invalid.

4. **Identify a counterexample**: We can choose Row 6 as a counterexample where S is false, U is false, and T is true.

Thus, the argument is invalid, and the counterexample is when S and U are true and T is false.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the best symbolization of the sentence ""Doctors are helpful unless their patients are rude,"" I will analyze the components of the statement step by step.

1. The phrase ""Doctors are helpful"" can be represented as H (where H stands for helpful).
2. The phrase ""unless their patients are rude"" indicates a condition that negates the helpfulness of doctors. The term ""rude"" can be represented as R, and ""not rude"" would be represented as ~R.
3. The word ""unless"" typically indicates a conditional relationship, meaning that if patients are rude (R), then doctors are not helpful (~H). Therefore, the statement can be interpreted as: if patients are not rude (~R), then doctors are helpful (H).

Now, we can express this relationship logically. The statement can be symbolized as:
- If R (patients are rude), then ~H (doctors are not helpful).
- If ~R (patients are not rude), then H (doctors are helpful).

This can be represented as H ∨ ~R, meaning doctors are helpful or patients are not rude.

Thus, the best symbolization of the sentence is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the validity of the argument using an indirect truth table, we will assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false. If we can find a consistent assignment of truth values that satisfies this assumption, the argument is invalid.

1. The premises are:
   - Premise 1: L ⊃ [(M ∨ ~N) ⊃ O]
   - Premise 2: (N ⊃ O) ⊃ (~P ⊃ Q)
   - Premise 3: R ⊃ ~Q

2. The conclusion is:
   - Conclusion: L ⊃ (R ⊃ P)

3. We will assume the conclusion is false, which means L is true and (R ⊃ P) is false. For (R ⊃ P) to be false, R must be true and P must be false.

4. Now we have:
   - L = True
   - R = True
   - P = False

5. Next, we need to check the premises:
   - For Premise 1: L is true, so we need [(M ∨ ~N) ⊃ O] to be true. This means M ∨ ~N must be false or O must be true. If M is true, then O must be true. If N is true, then ~N is false, so M must be false for the disjunction to be false.
   - For Premise 2: (N ⊃ O) must be true. If N is true, then O must be true. If N is false, then the premise is vacuously true.
   - For Premise 3: R is true, so ~Q must be true, which means Q must be false.

6. Now we can summarize:
   - If L is true, R is true, P is false, and Q is false, we can set N to true (which forces O to be true) and M to false (which keeps the first premise true).

7. This leads us to a consistent assignment:
   - L = True
   - M = False
   - N = True
   - O = True
   - P = False
   - Q = False
   - R = True

This assignment satisfies all premises while making the conclusion false, indicating that the argument is invalid.

Now, we check the provided counterexamples:
- Option b) L, M, O, Q, and R are true and N and P are false. This does not match our findings.
- Option c) L, N, O, Q, and R are true and M and P are false. This does not match our findings.
- Option d) L, N, and R are true and M, O, P, and Q are false. This does not match our findings.

However, since we have established that the argument is invalid, we can choose option c) as a valid counterexample.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To identify the conclusion of the argument, I will analyze the statements provided. 

1. The first statement establishes that the sense of a term is supposed to determine its reference. This is a premise, not the conclusion.
2. The second statement indicates that reference can vary without any difference in thought. This supports the argument but is also a premise.
3. The third statement reiterates that reference can vary without any difference in thought, which again serves as a premise.
4. The final statement asserts that our thoughts do not determine the meanings of our terms; meanings are not in the head. This is a conclusion drawn from the previous premises.

Thus, the conclusion of the argument is the last statement. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine the relationship between the propositions (G ∨ ~H) ⊃ G and ~G ≡ (~H · G), we will construct a truth table for both statements and analyze their results.

1. **Constructing the Truth Table:**
   We will evaluate the truth values for G, H, and their negations, and then compute the values for both propositions.

   | G | H | ~G | ~H | G ∨ ~H | (G ∨ ~H) ⊃ G | ~H · G | ~G ≡ (~H · G) |
   |---|---|----|----|--------|---------------|--------|---------------|
   | T | T |  F |  F |   T    |       T       |   F    |       T       |
   | T | F |  F |  T |   T    |       T       |   T    |       F       |
   | F | T |  T |  F |   F    |       F       |   F    |       T       |
   | F | F |  T |  T |   T    |       F       |   F    |       T       |

2. **Analyzing the Results:**
   - For the first proposition (G ∨ ~H) ⊃ G:
     - It is true in the first two rows and false in the last two rows.
   - For the second proposition ~G ≡ (~H · G):
     - It is true in the first, third, and fourth rows, and false in the second row.

3. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - The two propositions are not logically equivalent because they do not have the same truth values in all cases.
   - They are not contradictory because there are instances (rows 1 and 3) where both propositions are true.
   - Since there are instances where both propositions can be true (rows 1 and 3) and instances where they can be false (rows 2 and 4), they are consistent.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the best symbolization of the given sentence, I will break down the components of the statement step by step.

1. The sentence has two main parts connected by ""or"" (disjunction):
   - ""England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.""
   - ""China's promoting human rights is not a sufficient condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds.""

2. The first part can be symbolized as:
   - ""E is a necessary condition for F"" translates to ""F ⊃ E"" (if France subsidizes agriculture, then England must be importing beef).

3. The second part states that ""China's promoting human rights is not a sufficient condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds,"" which translates to:
   - ""C ⊃ S"" means ""if China promotes human rights, then South Africa supplies diamonds."" The negation of this is ""~(C ⊃ S)"" which means ""it is not the case that if China promotes human rights, then South Africa supplies diamonds.""

4. Combining these two parts with ""or,"" we get:
   - ""(F ⊃ E) ∨ ~(C ⊃ S)"".

Now, I will compare this derived expression with the provided options:
- a) (E ≡ F) ∨ ~(C ≡ S)
- b) (E ≡ F) ∨ (~C ⊃ S)
- c) (E ⊃ F) ∨ ~(C ⊃ S)
- d) (F ⊃ E) ∨ ~(C ⊃ S)

The derived expression matches option d) (F ⊃ E) ∨ ~(C ⊃ S).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To interpret the given arguments in predicate logic, I will analyze each part step by step.

1. The expression ""Wn ∨ Wm"" translates to ""Either Nancy or Marvin are at work."" This is consistent across all choices.

2. The expression ""(∀x)[Lx ⊃ (Dx ⊃ ~Wx)]"" means ""For all x, if x is a lawyer, then if x is out to dinner, x is not at work."" This suggests that being a lawyer and being out to dinner implies not being at work. 

3. The expression ""Ln • Dn"" indicates that ""Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner."" This means that according to the previous logic, Nancy is not at work.

4. The conclusion ""~(∀x)~Wx"" translates to ""It is not the case that everything is not at work,"" which implies that at least one person is at work.

Now, I will evaluate the choices based on this analysis:

- Choice a) states that ""All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner,"" which is incorrect because it should be ""All lawyers are out to dinner if they are not at work.""
- Choice b) has the same issue as choice a) regarding the interpretation of lawyers and dinner.
- Choice c) states ""All lawyers are out to dinner if they are not at work,"" which is incorrect because it should be the other way around.
- Choice d) correctly states ""All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner,"" and it concludes that ""not everything is at work,"" which aligns with the logical interpretation.

Therefore, the best interpretation is found in choice d.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To identify the conclusion of the argument, I will analyze the statements provided. 

1. The first statement asserts that ""It is wrong for society to kill a murderer."" This is a strong claim and seems to be the main point being argued.
2. The second statement provides reasoning for the first claim, indicating that if a murderer is wrong in killing his victim, then society is also wrong in killing the murderer. This is a conditional statement that supports the conclusion.
3. The third statement confirms that ""a murderer is wrong in killing his victim,"" which serves as a premise that reinforces the reasoning.

Given this analysis, the conclusion of the argument is the first statement, which is the main assertion being made.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which proposition is not an immediate consequence of the given premises, I will analyze each option step by step.

1. **Premises Analysis**:
   - Premise 1: \( I \supset (J \equiv K) \)
   - Premise 2: \( (J \equiv K) \supset (L \lor M) \)
   - Premise 3: \( I \supset \sim L \)

2. **Immediate Consequences**:
   - From Premise 1, if \( I \) is true, then \( J \equiv K \) must also be true.
   - From Premise 2, if \( J \equiv K \) is true, then \( L \lor M \) must be true.
   - From Premise 3, if \( I \) is true, then \( L \) must be false (i.e., \( \sim L \) is true).

3. **Evaluating Each Choice**:
   - a) \( \sim L \): This can be derived directly from Premise 3 if \( I \) is true.
   - b) \( J \equiv K \): This can be derived from Premise 1 if \( I \) is true.
   - c) \( I \supset (L \lor M) \): This can be derived by combining Premise 1 and Premise 2. If \( I \) is true, then \( J \equiv K \) is true, which leads to \( L \lor M \) being true.
   - d) \( \sim L \supset (J \equiv K) \): This is not an immediate consequence because \( \sim L \) being true does not necessarily imply \( J \equiv K \) without knowing the truth of \( I \).

Based on this analysis, the proposition that is not an immediate consequence is option d.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To construct a truth table for the argument, we need to evaluate the premises and the conclusion based on the truth values of I and J. The premises are I ≡ ~J and I ∨ J, and the conclusion is I.

1. **Identify the components**:
   - I
   - J
   - ~J (not J)
   - I ≡ ~J (I is equivalent to not J)
   - I ∨ J (I or J)

2. **Construct the truth table**:

| I | J | ~J | I ≡ ~J | I ∨ J | Conclusion (I) |
|---|---|----|--------|-------|-----------------|
| T | T | F  | F      | T     | T               |
| T | F | T  | T      | T     | T               |
| F | T | F  | T      | T     | F               |
| F | F | T  | F      | F     | F               |

3. **Analyze the truth table**:
   - The argument is valid if whenever the premises (I ≡ ~J and I ∨ J) are true, the conclusion (I) is also true.
   - From the truth table, we see that:
     - In the first row, both premises are false, and the conclusion is true.
     - In the second row, both premises are true, and the conclusion is true.
     - In the third row, the first premise is true, the second premise is true, but the conclusion is false.
     - In the fourth row, both premises are false, and the conclusion is false.

Since there is a case (the third row) where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.

4. **Identify a counterexample**:
   - The counterexample occurs when I is false and J is true (third row).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To translate the statement ""Some folks are lucky"" into predicate logic, I need to identify the components of the statement. 

1. The phrase ""Some folks"" indicates that there exists at least one individual who is a ""folks"" and is also ""lucky."" This suggests the use of the existential quantifier (∃).
2. I will denote ""Fx"" as ""x is a folk"" and ""Lx"" as ""x is lucky.""
3. The correct translation should express that there exists at least one individual (x) such that both conditions hold true: that x is a folk and x is lucky.

Given these considerations, the best translation is (∃x)(Fx • Lx), which means ""there exists an x such that x is a folk and x is lucky.""

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To translate the statement ""Alexis is greeted by Ben"" into predicate logic, we need to identify the roles of Alexis and Ben in the greeting. In this case, Ben is the one performing the action of greeting, and Alexis is the one receiving the greeting.

1. The predicate Gxy indicates that x greets y. Therefore, if Ben greets Alexis, we would represent this as Gba, where 'b' (Ben) is the greeter and 'a' (Alexis) is the greeted.

2. The other options do not correctly represent the action described in the statement. For example, Gab would imply Alexis greets Ben, which is not the case. ~Gba would imply that Ben does not greet Alexis, which contradicts the original statement.

3. Therefore, the correct representation of ""Alexis is greeted by Ben"" is Gba, indicating that Ben greets Alexis.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To translate the statement ""Not all lobsters are red"" into predicate logic, we need to analyze the meaning of the statement.

1. The phrase ""Not all lobsters are red"" implies that there exists at least one lobster that is not red. This suggests that we are looking for a negation of a universal statement about lobsters being red.

2. The universal statement ""All lobsters are red"" can be expressed as (∀x)(Lx ⊃ Rx), where Lx means ""x is a lobster"" and Rx means ""x is red."" The negation of this statement would be that it is not true that all lobsters are red.

3. Therefore, the correct translation of ""Not all lobsters are red"" is the negation of the universal quantifier, which is expressed as ~(∀x)(Lx ⊃ Rx).

Thus, the best translation into predicate logic is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the validity of the argument using an indirect truth table, we will analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.

1. **Identify the premises and conclusion**:
   - Premise 1: \( H \equiv (I \cdot \sim J) \)
   - Premise 2: \( K \equiv \sim H \)
   - Premise 3: \( \sim (K \supset J) \)
   - Conclusion: \( I \equiv J \)

2. **Assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false**:
   - If \( I \equiv J \) is false, then \( I \) and \( J \) must have different truth values (one is true, the other is false).

3. **Analyze the truth values**:
   - Let's assume \( I \) is true and \( J \) is false (this will help us check the counterexamples).
   - From Premise 1: \( H \equiv (I \cdot \sim J) \) becomes \( H \equiv (T \cdot T) \), so \( H \) is true.
   - From Premise 2: \( K \equiv \sim H \) becomes \( K \equiv \sim T \), so \( K \) is false.
   - From Premise 3: \( \sim (K \supset J) \) becomes \( \sim (F \supset F) \), which is \( \sim T \), so this premise is false.

Since we have found a situation where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.

4. **Identify the counterexample**:
   - We have \( I = T \), \( H = T \), \( K = F \), and \( J = F \). This matches option b) which states: ""Invalid. Counterexample when I, H, and K are true and J is false.""

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the relationship between the propositions ~(J ∨ K) · L and (L ⊃ J) · K, we will construct a truth table for both expressions and analyze their results.

1. **Identify the propositions**: 
   - Let J, K, and L be the propositions.
   - The first expression is ~(J ∨ K) · L.
   - The second expression is (L ⊃ J) · K.

2. **Construct the truth table**: 
   We will evaluate the truth values for J, K, and L, and then compute the values for both expressions.

| J | K | L | J ∨ K | ~(J ∨ K) | L ⊃ J | (L ⊃ J) · K | ~(J ∨ K) · L |
|---|---|---|-------|----------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| T | T | T |   T   |    F     |   T   |      T      |      F       |
| T | T | F |   T   |    F     |   T   |      T      |      F       |
| T | F | T |   T   |    F     |   T   |      F      |      F       |
| T | F | F |   T   |    F     |   T   |      F      |      F       |
| F | T | T |   T   |    F     |   F   |      F      |      F       |
| F | T | F |   T   |    F     |   F   |      F      |      F       |
| F | F | T |   F   |    T     |   F   |      F      |      T       |
| F | F | F |   F   |    T     |   T   |      F      |      T       |

3. **Analyze the results**:
   - The column for ~(J ∨ K) · L has the truth values: F, F, F, F, F, F, T, T.
   - The column for (L ⊃ J) · K has the truth values: T, T, F, F, F, F, F, F.
   - Since there are rows where both expressions are true (specifically, the last two rows), they are not contradictory.
   - Since there are rows where one expression is true and the other is false, they are not logically equivalent.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The two statements are neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but they can be consistent since there are truth assignments where both can be true.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To translate the statement ""All first-year students take a swim test"" into predicate logic, I need to identify the components of the statement. 

1. Let F(x) represent ""x is a first-year student"" and S(x) represent ""x takes a swim test.""
2. The statement indicates that for every individual x, if x is a first-year student, then x takes a swim test. This is a conditional statement.
3. Therefore, the correct translation should express that for all x, if F(x) is true, then S(x) is also true.

Now, looking at the choices:
- a) (∀x)(Sx ⊃ Fx) translates to ""If x takes a swim test, then x is a first-year student,"" which is not what we want.
- b) (∀x)(Fx ⊃ Sx) translates to ""If x is a first-year student, then x takes a swim test,"" which matches our requirement.
- c) (∀x)(Fx ∨ Sx) translates to ""For all x, x is a first-year student or x takes a swim test,"" which is not correct.
- d) (∀x)(Fx ≡ Sx) translates to ""For all x, x is a first-year student if and only if x takes a swim test,"" which is also incorrect.

Thus, the best translation into predicate logic is option b.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To translate the statement ""Johnny came late"" into predicate logic, we need to identify the components of the statement. 

1. The subject of the statement is ""Johnny,"" which we can represent with a constant symbol, let's say ""j.""
2. The predicate ""came late"" can be represented as ""L,"" where ""L"" indicates the property of coming late.
3. Since the statement is specifically about Johnny, we can denote this as ""Lj,"" meaning ""Johnny came late.""

Now, let's evaluate the options:
- a) jL: This does not correctly represent the statement as it suggests ""j"" (Johnny) is the subject of ""L"" (came late), which is not the correct structure.
- b) Lj: This correctly represents ""Johnny came late.""
- c) Cj ∨ Lj: This introduces an additional predicate ""C"" (which is not part of the original statement) and uses a disjunction, which is not appropriate here.
- d) Lx: This is a general statement about any individual ""x"" coming late, which does not specify Johnny.

Based on this analysis, the best translation into predicate logic is option b) Lj.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To translate the statement ""No senior graduates without a major"" into predicate logic, we need to analyze the components of the statement.

1. The phrase ""No senior graduates"" suggests that if someone is a senior (Sx), then they cannot graduate (Gx) without having a major (Mx). This implies that if someone is a senior, they must have a major to graduate.

2. The logical structure we are looking for is that for all individuals (x), if they are a senior, then they must have a major in order to graduate. This can be expressed as: If Sx (senior), then Gx (graduates) implies Mx (has a major).

3. The correct logical form would be that for all x, if x is a senior, then it is not the case that x graduates without a major. This can be expressed as: (∀x)(Sx ⊃ Gx ⊃ Mx).

Now, let's evaluate the options:

a) (∀x)(Sx ⊃ ~Gx) - This means ""For all x, if x is a senior, then x does not graduate,"" which is not correct.

b) ~(∀x)(Sx ⊃ Gx) - This means ""It is not the case that for all x, if x is a senior, then x graduates,"" which does not capture the original statement.

c) (∀x)(~Sx ⊃ ~Gx) - This means ""For all x, if x is not a senior, then x does not graduate,"" which is not correct.

d) (∀x) ~(Sx ⊃ ~Gx) - This means ""For all x, it is not the case that if x is a senior, then x does not graduate,"" which correctly captures the idea that seniors must graduate with a major.

Thus, the best translation into predicate logic is option d.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To identify the conclusion of the argument, I need to analyze the statements provided. 

1. The argument begins by stating that genetics is a young science, which sets the context.
2. It then provides supporting details about the timeline of discoveries related to inheritance traits and DNA.
3. The final statement emphasizes that the understanding of DNA's importance came much later, which serves as a culmination of the argument's point about the youth of genetics.

The conclusion is typically the statement that encapsulates the main point being made, which in this case is that the understanding of DNA's importance is a significant aspect of the argument about the youth of genetics.

Therefore, the conclusion of the argument is best represented by the statement: ""The importance of DNA was not really understood until the 1950s.""

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine the best symbolization of the given sentence, I will break down the components of the sentence and analyze the logical structure.

1. The sentence states: ""Either England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture or China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds."" 
   - The first part, ""England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture,"" can be symbolized as \( E \supset F \) (if E then F).
   - The second part, ""China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds,"" can be symbolized as \( C \supset \sim S \) (if not S then C).

2. The overall structure of the sentence is an ""either/or"" statement, which indicates a disjunction (logical OR). Therefore, we can represent this as \( (E \supset F) \lor (C \supset \sim S) \).

3. Now, I will compare this with the provided options:
   - a) \( (E \supset F) \lor (C \equiv \sim S) \) - This uses equivalence instead of implication for the second part.
   - b) \( (F \supset E) \lor (\sim S \equiv C) \) - This reverses the implication and uses equivalence.
   - c) \( (E \supset F) \lor (S \supset \sim C) \) - This incorrectly uses implication in the second part.
   - d) \( (F \supset E) \lor (\sim S \supset C) \) - This also reverses the implication.

None of the options perfectly match the derived structure \( (E \supset F) \lor (C \supset \sim S) \). However, option a) is the closest, as it maintains the first part correctly and only alters the second part to an equivalence, which is not correct but is the least incorrect.

Thus, the best choice among the given options is a) because it retains the correct structure for the first part.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the best symbolization of the given sentence, I will break down the components of the sentence and analyze the logical structure.

1. The sentence states two conditions connected by ""or"" (disjunction). The first part is ""England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture,"" which can be symbolized as \( E \supset F \). This means if England imports beef, then France subsidizes agriculture.

2. The second part of the sentence is ""China's promoting human rights is a necessary condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds."" This can be symbolized as \( C \supset S \). This means if South Africa supplies diamonds, then China promotes human rights.

3. Since the sentence uses ""either...or,"" we combine these two parts with a disjunction: \( (E \supset F) \lor (C \supset S) \).

Now, I will compare this with the provided options:
- a) \( (E \supset F) \lor (S \supset C) \) - Incorrect, as it misrepresents the second part.
- b) \( (F \supset E) \lor (C \supset S) \) - Incorrect, as it misrepresents the first part.
- c) \( (E \supset F) \lor (C \supset S) \) - Correct, as it accurately represents both parts.
- d) \( (F \supset E) \lor (S \supset C) \) - Incorrect, as it misrepresents both parts.

Thus, the best symbolization of the sentence is option c.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the best symbolization of the sentence ""Dylan likes neither math nor science,"" I will analyze the options step by step.

1. The phrase ""neither...nor..."" indicates that both conditions (liking math and liking science) are false. This suggests a negation of the disjunction (OR) of the two statements.

2. The statement can be broken down into two parts:
   - M: Dylan likes math.
   - S: Dylan likes science.
   The sentence ""Dylan likes neither math nor science"" can be interpreted as ""It is not the case that Dylan likes math or science,"" which translates to the negation of the disjunction: ~(M ∨ S).

3. Now, I will evaluate the options:
   - a) M ∨ S: This means Dylan likes either math or science, which is not correct.
   - b) ~(M • S): This means it is not the case that Dylan likes both math and science, which does not capture the ""neither"" aspect.
   - c) ~(M ∨ S): This correctly represents that Dylan does not like either math or science.
   - d) ~M ∨ ~S: This means Dylan does not like math or he does not like science, which does not accurately reflect the ""neither"" condition.

Based on this analysis, the best symbolization of the sentence is option c) ~(M ∨ S).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To translate the statement ""All robots are artifacts"" into predicate logic, we need to identify the correct logical structure.

1. The statement indicates a universal quantification (""All robots""), which suggests that we are making a claim about every individual in the category of robots.
2. The phrase ""are artifacts"" indicates a relationship where being a robot implies being an artifact. This suggests a conditional relationship.
3. Therefore, we can express this as: For all x, if x is a robot (Rx), then x is an artifact (Ax). This is represented as (∀x)(Rx ⊃ Ax).

Now, let's evaluate the options:
- a) (∀x)(Ax ∨ Rx): This means ""For all x, x is an artifact or x is a robot,"" which is not the same as the original statement.
- b) (∀x)(Ax • Rx): This means ""For all x, x is both an artifact and a robot,"" which is also incorrect.
- c) (∀x)(Rx ⊃ Ax): This correctly states that if x is a robot, then x is an artifact.
- d) (∀x)(Rx • Ax): This means ""For all x, x is both a robot and an artifact,"" which is not what we want.

Thus, the best translation into predicate logic is option c.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the best symbolization of the sentence ""Since the university raised tuition, the president approved of it and the board didn't prevent it,"" I will break down the components of the sentence and analyze the options.

1. **Identify the components**:
   - Let U represent ""the university raised tuition.""
   - Let P represent ""the president approved of it.""
   - Let B represent ""the board prevented it."" Therefore, ~B represents ""the board didn't prevent it.""

2. **Analyze the structure of the sentence**:
   - The phrase ""Since the university raised tuition"" indicates that U is a condition that leads to the following outcomes.
   - The outcomes are ""the president approved of it"" (P) and ""the board didn't prevent it"" (~B). This suggests a conjunction (both must be true) following the condition U.

3. **Formulate the logical structure**:
   - The sentence can be interpreted as: If U is true, then both P and ~B must be true. This can be symbolized as U ⊃ (P • ~B).

Now, I will compare this interpretation with the provided options:
- a) (P • ~B) ⊃ U: This suggests that if both P and ~B are true, then U is true, which is not the intended meaning.
- b) (U ⊃ P) • B: This suggests that if U is true, then P is true, and B is true, which contradicts the statement about the board not preventing it.
- c) U ⊃ (P • ~B): This matches our interpretation, indicating that if U is true, then both P and ~B are true.
- d) U ⊃ (P ∨ ~B): This suggests that if U is true, then either P is true or ~B is true, which does not capture the conjunction required.

Based on this analysis, the best symbolization of the sentence is option c.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To identify the conclusion of the argument, I will analyze the structure of the statements provided. 

1. The argument begins with the assertion that ""We shouldn't abolish capital punishment."" This is presented as the main claim.
2. The subsequent statements provide reasoning to support this claim: ""If we do, prisons will become more crowded,"" and ""If prisons become more crowded, then we will have to build more prisons."" 
3. The final statement, ""And we don't want to build more prisons,"" serves as a reason against the action of abolishing capital punishment.

The conclusion is the main assertion that is being supported by the reasoning provided. In this case, the conclusion is clearly stated at the beginning: ""We shouldn't abolish capital punishment.""

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the best symbolization of the given sentence, I will break down the components of the sentence and analyze the logical structure.

1. The sentence states: ""Either England's not importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China promotes human rights if and only if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds."" 
   - The first part, ""England's not importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture,"" can be symbolized as \( F \supset \sim E \) (if France subsidizes agriculture, then England is not importing beef).
   - The second part, ""China promotes human rights if and only if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds,"" can be symbolized as \( C \equiv \sim S \) (China promotes human rights if and only if South Africa does not supply diamonds).

2. The overall structure of the sentence is an ""either/or"" statement, which indicates a disjunction. Therefore, we can represent the entire sentence as:
   \[
   (F \supset \sim E) \lor (C \equiv \sim S)
   \]

3. Now, I will compare this representation with the provided options:
   - a) \( (F \supset \sim E) \lor (C \equiv \sim S) \) - This matches our derived representation.
   - b) \( (\sim E \supset F) \lor (C \supset \sim S) \) - This does not match.
   - c) \( \sim (F \supset E) \lor (\sim S \supset C) \) - This does not match.
   - d) \( (F \supset E) \lor (C \equiv \sim S) \) - This does not match.

Based on this analysis, the best symbolization of the sentence is option a.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the validity of the argument using an indirect truth table, we will assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, and then check for contradictions.

1. The premises are:
   - (K · L) ⊃ M (If K and L are true, then M is true)
   - N ⊃ ~M (If N is true, then M is false)
   - N ∨ K (Either N is true or K is true)

2. The conclusion we want to test is:
   - L ⊃ K (If L is true, then K is true)

3. We will assume the conclusion is false, which means L is true and K is false.

Now, let's analyze the premises under these assumptions:

- From L being true and K being false, we can evaluate the first premise:
  - (K · L) is false (since K is false), thus (K · L) ⊃ M is true regardless of M.

- Next, we evaluate the second premise:
  - N ⊃ ~M. Since we have not assigned a truth value to N yet, we need to consider both cases for N (true and false).

- If N is true:
  - Then ~M must be true, which means M is false. This contradicts the first premise because if K is false, (K · L) is false, making (K · L) ⊃ M true regardless of M. However, if N is true, M must be false, which leads to a contradiction.

- If N is false:
  - Then N ∨ K is true because K is false, which means N ∨ K is false. This leads to a contradiction since we assumed N ∨ K is true.

Since both cases for N lead to contradictions, we conclude that the argument is invalid.

Now, we need to find a counterexample. The option that presents a counterexample is when L and M are true, and K and N are false. This satisfies the premises while making the conclusion false.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the validity of the argument using a truth table, we will analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.

1. **Identify the components**:
   - Premise 1: (G ≡ H) · ~I
   - Premise 2: ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I)
   - Conclusion: G

2. **Construct the truth table**:
   We will evaluate the truth values for G, H, and I, and then calculate the truth values for the premises and the conclusion.

| G | H | I | G ≡ H | ~I | (G ≡ H) · ~I | ~G | ~H | ~H ∨ I | ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) | G |

3. **Analyze the truth table**:
   - The argument is valid if whenever the premises are true, the conclusion is also true.
   - From the truth table, we see that there are rows where both premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

4. **Identify counterexamples**:
   - In the rows where both premises are true, we can see that when H is true and I is true, G is false (row 5). This shows that the argument is invalid.

Based on this analysis, the argument is invalid, and a counterexample is when H and I are true and G is false.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To construct a truth table for the argument ~(M ≡ ~N), we need to evaluate the expression for all possible truth values of M and N. 

1. **Identify the components**: The expression involves M, N, and the equivalence operator (≡). The negation operator (~) will also be applied.

2. **Create the truth table**: We will evaluate M, N, ~N, M ≡ ~N, and finally ~(M ≡ ~N).

| M     | N     | ~N    | M ≡ ~N | ~(M ≡ ~N) |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|-----------|

| F     | F     | T     | F      | T         |

3. **Analyze the results**: The column for ~(M ≡ ~N) shows that the expression is true when M is true and N is true (1st row) and when M is false and N is false (4th row). It is false when M is true and N is false (2nd row) and when M is false and N is true (3rd row).

Now, we need to determine if the argument is valid or invalid. An argument is valid if whenever the premises are true, the conclusion is also true. In this case, we see that there are instances (rows 2 and 3) where the conclusion is false while the premises are true.

Since the argument is invalid, we need to find a counterexample. 

- In row 2, M is true and N is false, which leads to ~(M ≡ ~N) being false. This is a valid counterexample.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To translate the statement ""Some CEO is wealthier than everyone"" into predicate logic, we need to break it down step by step.

1. The phrase ""Some CEO"" indicates the existence of at least one CEO, which we can represent with the existential quantifier (∃x)Cx.
2. The phrase ""is wealthier than everyone"" means that this CEO is wealthier than all individuals, which can be expressed as (∀y)(Py ⊃ Wxy). Here, for every person y, if y is a person, then the CEO x is wealthier than y.
3. Combining these two parts, we conclude that there exists a CEO x such that for all persons y, x is wealthier than y. This leads us to the logical expression: (∃x)Cx • (∀y)(Py ⊃ Wxy).

Now, let's evaluate the options:
- a) (∃x)Cx • (∀y)(Py • Wxy) - This incorrectly states that the CEO is wealthier than only those who are persons, which is not what we want.
- b) (∃x)Cx ⊃ (∀y)(Py ⊃ Wxy) - This suggests that if there exists a CEO, then for all persons, the CEO is wealthier than them, which is not the same as saying ""some CEO is wealthier than everyone.""
- c) (∃x)Cx • (∀y)(Py ⊃ Wxy) - This correctly states that there exists a CEO who is wealthier than everyone.
- d) (∀x)Px ⊃ (∃y)(Cy ⊃ Wxy) - This suggests that for all persons, there exists a CEO who is wealthier than them, which is not the correct interpretation.

Thus, the best translation into predicate logic is option c.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To translate the statement ""All children go to some school"" into predicate logic, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the components of the statement: The statement indicates that for every child (Cx), there exists at least one school (Sy) such that the child goes to that school (Gxy).

2. The structure of the statement suggests a universal quantifier for children and an existential quantifier for schools. This means that for every child, there is a corresponding school they go to.

3. The correct logical form should express that for every x (where x is a child), there exists a y (where y is a school) such that the relationship G (goes to) holds between x and y.

Now, let's analyze the options:

a) (∀x)(∃y)(Cx • Sy) • Gxy) - This suggests that for every x, there exists a y such that x is a child and y is a school, and x goes to y. This is not correct because it incorrectly combines the conditions.

b) (∀x)Sx ⊃ (∃y)(Cy • Gxy) - This suggests that if something is a school, then there exists a child that goes to it. This is not the correct interpretation.

c) (∀x)Cx ⊃ (∃y)(Sy • Gxy) - This suggests that if x is a child, then there exists a y such that y is a school and x goes to y. This correctly captures the meaning of the original statement.

d) (∀x)Sx • (∃y)(Cy • Gxy) - This suggests that all x are schools and there exists a child that goes to a school, which is not the correct interpretation.

Based on this analysis, the best translation into predicate logic is option c.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
