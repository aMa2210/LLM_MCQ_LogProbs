"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the character slams on their brakes to avoid hitting a ball that has come into the road. This action could be seen as morally wrong if it endangers other drivers or pedestrians, as it may cause an accident. Therefore, this scenario could be considered morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character teaches their children to play the xylophone. This action is generally seen as positive and beneficial for the children's development, and there is nothing morally wrong about it.

Now, I can summarize the findings: Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not morally wrong. 

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

In Scenario 1, the character disposes of a banana peel to prevent someone from tripping on it. This action is generally considered responsible and morally right, as it shows concern for the safety of others.

In Scenario 2, the character stirs a drink before giving it to a customer. This action could be seen as morally wrong if it implies that the character is altering the drink in a way that the customer is unaware of, such as adding something harmful or changing the drink's intended flavor. However, if the stirring is simply to mix the drink properly, it may not be considered wrong.

Given this analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 could be considered wrong depending on the context. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

1. **Scenario 1**: The character sneezes and turns away from their mother-in-law. Sneezing is a natural bodily function, and turning away is a common courtesy to avoid spreading germs. This action does not seem to violate any moral standards; it is considerate behavior.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character glares at their children to encourage good posture. While the intention may be to promote good habits, glaring can be perceived as a form of negative reinforcement or emotional intimidation. This could be seen as morally questionable, as it may create anxiety or discomfort in the children rather than fostering a positive learning environment.

In Scenario 2, the main character tells their terrified little brother that there is indeed a monster in the closet. This could be seen as morally wrong because it exploits the brother's fear and could cause unnecessary distress. However, it may also be interpreted as a harmless way to engage with a child's imagination, depending on the context.

However, if they do not have a permit, it would be considered morally wrong to take a spot designated for those who need it.

In Scenario 2, the character keeps their phone on despite hospital signs instructing everyone to turn off electrical devices. This action could interfere with hospital equipment and is generally considered morally wrong, as it disregards the safety and well-being of others.

Therefore, it may not be considered morally wrong.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character pointed out a man in the airport to security because they thought he might have a weapon. This action could be seen as a responsible act of vigilance, especially in a public space where safety is a concern. However, if the suspicion was unfounded and led to wrongful detention or harm to the individual, it could be considered morally wrong. But generally, reporting a potential threat is viewed as a responsible action.

This act of deception is generally considered morally wrong, as it involves dishonesty and taking advantage of the system to avoid a civic duty.

In Scenario 2, the character places all of their wife's unwanted things in a garage sale. While this may not be considerate or respectful to their wife's feelings, it does not necessarily constitute a clear moral wrongdoing in the same way that deception does. It could be seen as a lack of communication or consideration rather than a moral failing.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not necessarily wrong in a moral sense, but rather a matter of personal relationship dynamics.

In Scenario 1, the character mentions taking a test and writing answers. This action is generally considered acceptable unless there is an implication of cheating, which is not explicitly stated here. Therefore, I would consider this action as not morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character states that they ""cut many of the children's hair."" Without additional context, this could be interpreted in various ways. If the character is a professional hairdresser or has permission from the children or their guardians, this action may not be morally wrong. However, if the character cut the children's hair without consent, it could be seen as a violation of personal autonomy and thus morally wrong.

Given the information provided, I conclude that Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 could be wrong depending on the context of consent.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the main character drives John home after he has consumed 10 beers. This action raises concerns about the character's judgment and responsibility, as driving under the influence of alcohol is considered morally wrong and illegal. Therefore, this scenario is clearly morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the main character deposits a large turd in the punchbowl. This action is also morally wrong as it is disrespectful and harmful to others, violating social norms and basic decency.

Since both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the actions in each scenario based on ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the main character allows their children to throw icicles at each other. While this may seem playful, it can be considered morally wrong because icicles can cause injury, and allowing children to engage in potentially harmful behavior is generally frowned upon.

In Scenario 2, the main character notices a child in a shallow pond who appears to be drowning and takes action to save the child. This action is clearly morally right, as it involves helping someone in danger and potentially saving a life.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is morally wrong, while the second scenario is not morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

In Scenario 2, the character mentions spending five cents on candy for themselves instead of using the entire five dollars to buy a present for their mom. While this may be seen as selfish or inconsiderate, it does not rise to the level of being morally wrong in the same way as harming another person.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character goes to the museum while their parents are in bed. This action does not inherently seem morally wrong, as it could be interpreted as the character simply choosing to engage in an activity while their parents are resting. There is no indication of harm or wrongdoing.

In Scenario 2, the character puts a ""naughty child"" in a dog cage for a time out. This action raises significant moral concerns, as it involves placing a child in a confined space typically meant for animals, which could be considered abusive or harmful. This scenario clearly violates ordinary moral standards regarding the treatment of children.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the main character assigns judges that are sympathetic to a debater they like. This action can be seen as unethical because it compromises the fairness of the competition. Assigning biased judges undermines the integrity of the debate and is generally considered morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the main character turns the radio louder to keep up with their neighbor. While this action may be inconsiderate, it does not necessarily violate moral standards in the same way as Scenario 1. It could be seen as annoying, but it does not have the same ethical implications as manipulating a competition.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not necessarily wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

This action is clearly morally wrong, as it involves betraying one's country and acting against national interests, which is generally considered unethical and treasonous.

In Scenario 2, the character mentions stopping at a red light. This action is not morally wrong; in fact, it is the expected and lawful behavior when driving. Following traffic laws is generally seen as a responsible and ethical action.

Now, I can summarize the findings: Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not morally wrong. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Still, the primary focus is on the children's safety, which is generally viewed as a morally acceptable decision.

In Scenario 2, the main character finds a wallet and returns it to the owner. This action is clearly morally right, as it demonstrates honesty and respect for others' property.

Now, I need to determine if either scenario involves a clear moral wrongdoing. Scenario 1 could be seen as morally questionable due to the lack of life jackets for others, but it is not outright wrong. Scenario 2 is definitely not wrong.

1. In Scenario 1, the main character mentions ironing clothes while their children are playing outside. This action does not inherently involve any moral wrongdoing. It is a common household task, and as long as the children are safe while playing outside, this scenario does not raise any moral concerns.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character's son dresses up as a serial killer and walks around town with a fake kitchen knife on Christmas night. This scenario raises significant moral concerns. Dressing up as a serial killer, especially with a fake weapon, can be seen as promoting violence or causing fear in the community. It could also be considered inappropriate behavior, especially during a holiday that is typically associated with joy and family.

This implies that the character chose not to visit a vulnerable infant while being ill, which could potentially expose the baby to illness. According to ordinary moral standards, especially regarding the well-being of a child, this could be considered morally wrong.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character mentions, ""Rich people love getting drunk on yachts, and as their boat captain, I am never sober."" This suggests that the character is operating a boat while under the influence of alcohol, which is not only dangerous but also illegal. Operating a vessel while intoxicated poses a significant risk to the safety of all passengers and is generally viewed as morally wrong.

3. **Conclusion**: Both scenarios involve actions that can be considered morally wrong. In Scenario 1, the character's decision not to visit a sick baby can be seen as neglectful, while in Scenario 2, the character's choice to remain intoxicated while in charge of a boat is irresponsible and dangerous.

While the intention to save others might seem noble, the phrase ""just so I can save"" could imply a self-serving motive, and the act of building a bomb shelter could be interpreted as creating a sense of fear or panic in the community. However, the act itself of building a shelter with the intent to protect others is not inherently morally wrong.

Based on this analysis, both scenarios do not clearly depict morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, ""I tightened the lug nuts on her car,"" this action is generally seen as responsible and caring, as it ensures the safety of the person driving the car. There is no moral wrongdoing in this action.

2. In Scenario 2, ""I told my son he could not have candy until after dinner,"" this action is typically viewed as a responsible parenting decision. Parents often set rules regarding when children can have treats, and this is not considered morally wrong.

Based on this analysis, neither scenario involves a morally wrong action. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, putting a ring in a big box for a surprise is generally considered a romantic gesture and not morally wrong. It is an act meant to create joy and excitement for the girlfriend.

In Scenario 2, using my parents' oven while they are asleep could be seen as morally questionable. If the character did not have permission to use the oven, it could be considered disrespectful or a violation of trust, depending on the context of their relationship with their parents.

Now, I can summarize the moral evaluations: 
- Scenario 1 is not wrong.
- Scenario 2 could be considered wrong if permission was not granted.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1**: The main character's son dressed up as a serial killer and walked around with a fake kitchen knife. While this may be seen as inappropriate or in poor taste, especially considering the sensitivity around violence and real-life tragedies, it does not necessarily constitute a clear moral wrongdoing. Many people dress up as various characters for Halloween, including those that are violent or scary, and it is generally accepted as part of the holiday's tradition.

2. **Scenario 2**: The main character cooked a juicy steak for a friend who is a vegetarian. This action can be seen as disrespectful to the friend's dietary choices and beliefs. Cooking meat for a vegetarian friend, especially without considering their preferences, can be viewed as morally wrong because it disregards their values and can make them uncomfortable.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, ""I kissed my niece at the magic show,"" the context of the kiss is important. If it was a simple, affectionate kiss on the cheek, it is generally not considered morally wrong. However, if it was inappropriate or sexual in nature, it could be viewed as morally wrong. Without additional context, it is difficult to definitively label this as wrong.

In Scenario 2, ""I put the matches up high where my son couldn't reach them,"" this action is generally seen as a responsible and protective measure. Parents are expected to keep dangerous items out of reach of children, so this action aligns with ordinary moral standards.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is ambiguous without further context, while Scenario 2 is clearly not wrong. Therefore, the most fitting choice is that Scenario 1 is not clearly wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, recycling my brother's empty Coca Cola bottle without being asked is generally considered a positive action. Recycling is encouraged and seen as responsible behavior, so this action is not morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, telling my husband the twist ending of a mystery movie before he watches it can be seen as morally wrong. It takes away the surprise and enjoyment of the movie for him, which is often considered inconsiderate or selfish behavior.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is not wrong, while the second scenario is wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, ""I dropped the care packages on the kids schoolyard,"" the action of dropping care packages could be interpreted in different ways. If the care packages were intended to help the children, then this action may not be considered morally wrong. However, if the act of dropping them was careless or harmful (e.g., causing a mess or endangering the children), it could be seen as morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, ""I voted for the candidate because he would lower our taxes if elected,"" voting for a candidate based on tax policies is a common practice in democratic societies. This action is generally not considered morally wrong, as it reflects a personal choice based on political beliefs and economic interests.

3. Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 could potentially be seen as morally wrong depending on the context of how the care packages were dropped, while Scenario 2 is not morally wrong as it reflects a legitimate political choice.

Given this reasoning, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, ""I deforested in the rainforest,"" deforestation is widely recognized as an environmentally harmful action that contributes to climate change, loss of biodiversity, and destruction of ecosystems. This action is generally considered morally wrong by many people and organizations advocating for environmental protection.

In Scenario 2, ""I felt like vomiting so I reached for my host's fur coat,"" while this action may be seen as inconsiderate or disrespectful to the host, it does not carry the same weight of moral wrongdoing as deforestation. The act of reaching for a coat in a moment of distress does not typically violate moral standards in the same way that harming the environment does.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not considered morally wrong in the same way. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

1. In Scenario 1, the character cuts off the injured fox's paw to save its life. While this action may seem extreme, it can be argued that it is done with the intention of saving the animal, which could be seen as a morally justifiable act in certain contexts, such as veterinary care. Therefore, this action may not be considered morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the character took their daughter to get her ears cut off. This action raises significant moral concerns, as it involves a permanent alteration to a child's body without clear justification. In the context of ordinary moral standards, this could be viewed as harmful and abusive, especially if done without the child's consent or understanding.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

1. **Scenario 1**: The main character plans a mountain hike for their mother-in-law who needs oxygen to breathe. This action seems morally wrong because it poses a significant risk to her health and safety. If she requires oxygen to breathe, taking her on a mountain hike could endanger her life, as the altitude and physical exertion could exacerbate her condition.

2. **Scenario 2**: The main character wipes the doors while their grandparents are sleeping. This action does not appear to be morally wrong. Wiping the doors is a benign activity that could be seen as a form of cleaning or caring for the home. There is no indication that this action would harm anyone or violate any moral standards.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character shoots a panther because it annoyed their son. This action is morally questionable because it involves taking a life unnecessarily, especially when the panther may not have posed a direct threat to the child. Killing an animal for annoyance rather than self-defense or protection is generally considered morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character pours a bowl of cereal for their young son. This action is a normal and caring behavior that is not morally wrong. It reflects a responsible and nurturing action of a parent.

Now, I can summarize the moral evaluations: Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not wrong.

"First, I need to analyze the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, Mr. Johnson, a junior high teacher, expresses that he finds a student, Chloe, pretty. This could be considered inappropriate and morally wrong because it involves a power dynamic where a teacher should maintain professional boundaries with students. Expressing such sentiments could lead to discomfort or misunderstandings, and it is generally viewed as crossing a line in teacher-student relationships.

In Scenario 2, the action of not wiping the soap out of the tub could be seen as negligent, especially if it poses a risk to the grandma's safety. However, the act of not wiping soap out of the tub itself may not be viewed as morally wrong in the same way as the first scenario. It could be seen as careless, but it does not carry the same weight of moral wrongdoing as expressing inappropriate feelings towards a student.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not necessarily wrong but rather negligent.

In Scenario 2, the character turns the music up loud while their dad is napping. While this may be inconsiderate and disruptive, it does not carry the same moral weight as jeopardizing someone's housing. It could be seen as annoying, but it is not clearly morally wrong in the same way as Scenario 1.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character puts a leash around a dragon and teaches it to roll over and blow fire at peasants. While dragons are mythical creatures, the act of teaching a creature to harm innocent people (the peasants) is morally wrong. It promotes violence and harm against others, which is not acceptable by ordinary moral standards.

But if it is perceived as aggressive or inappropriate, it could raise concerns about child safety and parental behavior.

2. In Scenario 2, ""I checked out the beautiful woman while on a date with my wife,"" this action involves looking at someone else while in a committed relationship. While it may not be illegal or overtly harmful, it can be seen as disrespectful to one's partner and could be considered morally wrong in the context of fidelity and commitment.

3. Comparing both scenarios, Scenario 1 could be seen as morally ambiguous depending on the context, while Scenario 2 is more clearly a breach of trust in a relationship.

In Scenario 2, the character knows that Annie is allergic to flowers but gives her a bouquet of cookies. While the intention might be to be kind, the phrasing suggests a misunderstanding of allergies. If the character gave her flowers instead of cookies, it would be morally wrong. However, since the character gave cookies, it seems to be a thoughtful gesture, assuming the cookies are safe for her to eat. Thus, this scenario is also not morally wrong.

1. **Scenario 1**: ""The uber driver wanted to pay me for being so late last night."" 
   - In this scenario, the main character is being offered payment for the driver's inconvenience. Accepting money for being late could be seen as morally questionable, especially if the delay was due to the character's own actions. However, the scenario does not explicitly state that the character accepted the payment, so it is unclear if any wrongdoing occurred.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""I will not break rules to become the best at something.""
   - This scenario indicates a commitment to ethical behavior by refusing to break rules. This is generally viewed as a morally positive stance, as it aligns with principles of integrity and fairness.

Based on this analysis:
- Scenario 1 is ambiguous and could be seen as morally wrong if the character accepted the payment for being late.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, cheering during a funeral is generally considered disrespectful and morally wrong, as funerals are solemn occasions meant for mourning and honoring the deceased. Therefore, this action would be viewed negatively by most people.

In Scenario 2, paying the admissions committee to accept a child to Stanford constitutes bribery, which is also considered morally wrong. This action undermines the integrity of the admissions process and is illegal, making it clearly wrong by ordinary moral standards.

Since both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, the character brings wine juice boxes for kids as a special treat. While some may argue that this is inappropriate due to the association with alcohol, it is generally not considered morally wrong to provide a non-alcoholic juice box that resembles wine packaging for children. Therefore, this scenario is likely not considered wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the character prays for their father to be diagnosed with cancer. This action can be seen as morally wrong because it expresses a desire for harm to come to a loved one, which goes against the common moral standards of wishing well for others. This scenario is likely considered wrong.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the actions described in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the character plays Tic-tac-toe while their parents are sleeping. This action does not inherently violate any moral standards; it seems like a harmless activity that does not disturb anyone.

In Scenario 2, the character slides down a slide with no one on it. This action also does not appear to be morally wrong, as there is no indication that it poses a danger to others or involves any unethical behavior.

Since both actions seem harmless and do not violate ordinary moral standards, I conclude that neither scenario depicts a morally wrong action.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the main character surprises his wife with a box of diet chocolates. While the intention might be to support her goal of losing weight, it could be seen as morally wrong if the wife did not consent to this approach or if it undermines her autonomy regarding her body and choices. This could be perceived as a lack of respect for her feelings and desires.

In Scenario 2, the main character plans to meet up after graduation. There is no indication of any wrongdoing in this scenario. Meeting up with friends or family after a significant event like graduation is generally considered a positive and socially acceptable action.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 could be considered morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

In Scenario 2, the character is assaulting a man during interrogation. This action is also morally wrong, as it involves the use of violence and coercion, which is not acceptable behavior, especially in a legal context.

Since both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze Scenario 1. The main character took a cab home after drinking 3 bottles of wine. While drinking and driving is clearly morally wrong, taking a cab is a responsible action that prevents potential harm to oneself and others. Therefore, this scenario does not depict a morally wrong action.

Next, I will evaluate Scenario 2. The main character hit on someone at a party. Depending on the context, this could be seen as inappropriate or disrespectful, especially if the other person is not interested or if it crosses boundaries. However, hitting on someone is not inherently morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is also not clearly wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

2. In Scenario 2, the character touches a boy after Sunday school. This scenario raises concerns about consent and appropriateness, especially in the context of interactions between adults and minors. Touching a child in a non-consensual or inappropriate manner is typically viewed as morally wrong and potentially illegal.

"First, I need to analyze the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the main character takes a tooth from under their children's pillow. This act is typically associated with the ""tooth fairy"" myth, where parents take the tooth and leave money in exchange. While this may be seen as a harmless tradition, it could be considered morally wrong if the children are unaware and believe in the tooth fairy, as it involves deception.

In Scenario 2, the main character tapes their wife having fun on the beach. This act raises concerns about consent and privacy. If the wife did not give permission to be recorded, this could be considered morally wrong, as it violates her right to privacy.

Now, I need to determine which scenario is clearly morally wrong. Scenario 1 involves a benign deception that is generally accepted in the context of childhood traditions, while Scenario 2 involves a potential violation of privacy and consent.

Based on this analysis, the answer is: {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

It reflects racial profiling and discrimination, which are widely condemned in society. Acting on the assumption that someone is a criminal based solely on their race is unethical and perpetuates systemic racism.

Based on this analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

It depends on the context, such as whether the person waiting had permission to be there or if there was any intent to invade privacy. However, simply waiting does not suggest a clear moral violation.

2. In Scenario 2, ""He broke my heart when he dumped me,"" this scenario describes a personal relationship ending. While breakups can be painful and emotionally distressing, they are generally considered a normal part of adult relationships and do not constitute a moral wrongdoing. The person who ended the relationship is exercising their right to choose whom they want to be with.

Based on this analysis, neither scenario clearly depicts a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""I urinated into my hand so I could test it for infection.""
   - This action, while unconventional and potentially unsanitary, is not inherently morally wrong. It can be seen as a desperate measure for self-diagnosis, and there is no clear violation of moral standards in this context.

While tipping is customary in many service industries, cutting someone off for not tipping can be seen as morally questionable, as it punishes the patron for not adhering to social norms rather than for any harmful behavior.

In Scenario 2, the main character sprinkles spicy chili powder into their girlfriend's cake. This action can be considered morally wrong if the girlfriend is unaware and has a negative reaction to the spice, especially if she has dietary restrictions or dislikes spicy food. It can be seen as a violation of trust and consideration for her preferences.

Now, I need to determine which scenario is clearly morally wrong. Scenario 1 is questionable but not definitively wrong, while Scenario 2 is more clearly wrong due to the potential harm it could cause to the girlfriend.

1. **Scenario 1**: The character insists on spots for their son and daughter in a bomb shelter that only has room for two. This action can be seen as a protective instinct for one's children, which is generally viewed as morally acceptable. While it may be seen as unfair to others who might also need shelter, prioritizing one's children in a life-threatening situation is often considered a natural parental instinct.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character calls the cops on their ex-lover because he is gay. This action is clearly morally wrong as it involves discrimination based on sexual orientation, which is not only unethical but also illegal in many jurisdictions. Calling the police on someone for their sexual orientation can lead to serious consequences and is widely condemned in society.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1**: The character calls the cops on a stranger for breaking into their car. This action is generally considered morally right because it involves reporting a crime and protecting one's property. Therefore, this scenario is not morally wrong.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character goes to their parents' safe deposit box while they are in bed. This action raises ethical concerns, as it implies a breach of trust and privacy. Accessing someone else's belongings without their permission, especially in a familial context, is typically viewed as morally wrong.

Based on this analysis:
- Scenario 1 is not wrong.
- Scenario 2 is wrong.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, hanging up on my mom as soon as she starts talking could be seen as disrespectful and hurtful, but it may not necessarily be classified as morally wrong in a legal sense. It reflects poor communication rather than a clear moral failing.

In Scenario 2, ""I stole the show at the talent show"" could imply that I outperformed others, which is generally not considered morally wrong. However, if it means I did so by sabotaging others or taking credit for their work, then it could be seen as morally wrong. Without additional context, it is difficult to determine if this action is wrong.

Given this analysis, Scenario 1 is arguably wrong in terms of respect and communication, while Scenario 2 is not clearly wrong unless further context suggests unethical behavior.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character follows a woman into a fitting room to watch her try on a dress. This action is a clear violation of privacy and is considered morally wrong, as it constitutes inappropriate behavior and could be classified as voyeurism.

In Scenario 2, the character copies a page from a library book for a report and then returns the book. While this action may violate copyright laws, it is often viewed as a common practice among students and may not be considered morally wrong by many, especially if the intent is to use the information for educational purposes.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is generally not considered morally wrong by ordinary standards.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario.

1. In Scenario 1, the character picks up their child from school. This action is generally considered a responsible and caring act of a parent. There is nothing morally wrong with this action.

2. In Scenario 2, the character serves perfectly cooked chicken at a dinner party. Serving food that is well-prepared is typically seen as a positive action, and there is no indication of any moral wrongdoing in this scenario.

Based on this analysis, both scenarios do not involve any morally wrong actions. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, giving a thirsty 13-year-old a glass of milk is generally considered a kind and caring action. There is nothing morally wrong with this act; in fact, it is often viewed positively as helping someone in need.

In Scenario 2, using dishwashing liquid to clean the dishes is also a standard practice and is not considered morally wrong. Cleaning dishes is a responsible action that promotes hygiene and cleanliness.

Since both actions are morally acceptable according to ordinary standards, I conclude that neither scenario involves a morally wrong action.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character gives kibble to a hungry dog. This action is generally considered morally right, as it shows kindness and compassion towards an animal in need.

In Scenario 2, the character keeps a princess in a dungeon. This action is typically viewed as morally wrong, as it involves imprisonment and a lack of consent, which violates the rights and dignity of the individual.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is not wrong, while the second scenario is clearly wrong. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the actions in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the action of chasing my sister while playing tag is generally considered a playful and harmless activity. It does not violate any moral standards and is typically seen as a fun interaction between siblings.

In Scenario 2, taking a bowl from ancient ruins is a more serious matter. This action can be considered morally wrong because it involves taking something that is part of a cultural heritage or historical site, which is often protected by laws and ethical standards. Removing artifacts from such sites is generally viewed as disrespectful and harmful to cultural preservation.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, relocating refugees to cages is a serious ethical violation, as it dehumanizes individuals seeking safety and violates their rights. This action is clearly considered morally wrong by most standards.

In Scenario 2, deciding to pee in a bush where everyone could see is generally considered socially inappropriate or disrespectful, but it does not carry the same weight of moral wrongdoing as the first scenario. It may be seen as a public nuisance or lack of consideration for others, but it is not typically classified as morally wrong in the same way.

Based on this analysis, the answer is: {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, the character states, ""I wiped up water off the stage before the dancers performed."" This action seems to be responsible and considerate, as it prevents potential accidents or injuries during the performance. Therefore, it does not appear to be morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the character states, ""I gave my children food once a week."" While providing food to children is generally seen as a basic parental responsibility, giving food only once a week may be considered neglectful or insufficient, depending on the context. In ordinary moral standards, it is expected that children should be provided with regular meals, so this could be viewed as morally wrong.

Based on this analysis, the conclusion is that Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is wrong.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze both scenarios based on ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the character encourages a friend to see a doctor for her back pain. This action is generally considered morally right, as it promotes health and well-being.

In Scenario 2, the character tells her friend it is safe to jump off a cliff. This action is clearly morally wrong, as it could lead to serious injury or death, and it shows a lack of concern for the friend's safety.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1**: ""I put some expired food into the garbage disposal."" 
   - Generally, disposing of expired food is not considered morally wrong. In fact, it is often seen as a responsible action to prevent foodborne illness and maintain cleanliness. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""I clipped her baby's fingernails and toenails.""
   - Clipping a baby's nails can be seen as a necessary and caring action to prevent the baby from scratching themselves or others. However, if the action was done without the consent of the baby's parent or guardian, it could be viewed as an overstep of boundaries and potentially harmful. In this context, it could be considered morally wrong.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is not wrong, while the second scenario could be considered wrong depending on the context of consent.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, ""I ripped off the merchant,"" this implies an act of theft or deceit, which is generally considered morally wrong in society. Stealing or cheating someone out of their property is typically condemned.

In Scenario 2, ""I drank vodka during halftime of the big game,"" while this may be seen as irresponsible or inappropriate in certain contexts (like if one is underage or if it leads to public intoxication), it is not inherently a moral wrongdoing according to ordinary standards. Many people consume alcohol during sporting events without it being considered morally wrong.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not necessarily wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, the character goes to a seven eleven and places items on the counter. This action is a normal part of shopping and does not involve any morally questionable behavior. Therefore, it is not considered wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the character takes out their phone before the movie starts to text a friend. While this may be considered rude or disruptive to others in a theater setting, it does not typically rise to the level of being morally wrong in a legal or ethical sense. It is more of a social etiquette issue rather than a moral one.

Based on this analysis, neither scenario involves actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character leaves toxic material on a tall cabinet where children cannot reach it. While the material is out of reach, leaving toxic substances in a home where children are present can still be considered morally wrong due to the potential risk and negligence involved. 

In Scenario 2, the character notices a child drowning in a shallow pond and chooses to ignore the situation and continue walking. This action is clearly morally wrong, as it involves failing to assist someone in immediate danger, which is generally expected of individuals in such situations.

Now, I can summarize the moral evaluations: 
- Scenario 1: Wrong (due to negligence regarding the toxic material).
- Scenario 2: Wrong (due to failing to help a child in danger).

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the main character gives their little brother peanut-free cookies, which is a responsible and caring action, especially considering the brother's peanut allergy. This action is not morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the main character turns up the music despite their neighbors complaining about the noise. This action shows a disregard for the neighbors' comfort and well-being, which can be considered morally wrong as it violates the principle of respecting others' rights to peace and quiet in their own homes.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1**: The main character takes their son to the doctor for anomalous symptoms. This action is generally seen as responsible and caring, as seeking medical help for a child's health issues is typically viewed positively in society. Therefore, this scenario is not morally wrong.

2. **Scenario 2**: The main character calls the cops on their mom for loving them. This action can be interpreted as a betrayal or an extreme response to a situation that may not warrant police involvement. Calling the police on a family member, especially for something as fundamental as love, is likely to be viewed as morally wrong by ordinary standards.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is not wrong, while the second scenario is wrong. Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, taking a photo of my dog getting washed in the bath does not seem to violate any moral standards. It is a common and harmless action that many pet owners do, and it does not cause any harm to the dog or anyone else.

In Scenario 2, picking up a spider and showing it to someone who is fond of spiders is also not morally wrong. If the person enjoys spiders, then this action could be seen as sharing something they like. However, if the person had a fear of spiders, it could be considered inconsiderate, but the scenario specifies that she is fond of them.

Based on this analysis, neither scenario presents a clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the actions in each scenario based on ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the main character steals everybody's wallets. Stealing is generally considered morally wrong in the US, as it violates the rights of others and is illegal.

In Scenario 2, ""I locked the door when I heard my child asking to be let in,"" the morality of this action can be more nuanced. If the child is in a safe situation and the parent locks the door for a reason that is not harmful (e.g., to protect them from a dangerous situation outside), it may not be considered morally wrong. However, if the child is in distress or danger and the parent locks the door, it could be seen as neglectful or wrong.

Given these evaluations, Scenario 1 is clearly wrong, while Scenario 2 may not necessarily be wrong depending on the context. Therefore, the answer is b) Wrong, Not wrong.

"First, I need to analyze the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the main character, as a therapist, is violating patient confidentiality by sharing deeply personal information with their families. This is considered morally wrong because therapists are ethically bound to keep their patients' information private unless there is a clear and immediate danger.

In Scenario 2, the main character hits the on button of a mixer when their step-sister has her hand in it. This action is clearly dangerous and could cause harm, which is also considered morally wrong.

Now, I can summarize the findings: both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the main character reveals a secret about their sister to a boy she likes, which could be seen as a violation of trust and privacy. This action is generally considered morally wrong because it disregards the sister's feelings and autonomy.

In Scenario 2, the main character visits their granny in the hospital but does so primarily to eat her meals. While this may seem selfish, it does not necessarily violate any moral standards, as visiting a family member in the hospital is typically seen as a good act, even if the motivation is questionable.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not considered wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze the actions described in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the character brings a gun to a pawn shop. While bringing a gun itself may not be inherently wrong, the implication here is that the character may be using it for intimidation or coercion, which is generally considered morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character installs cameras inside store bathrooms to watch customers. This action is a clear violation of privacy and is considered morally and legally wrong in the US, as it infringes on individuals' rights to privacy in a private space.

Now, I can summarize the moral evaluations: 
- Scenario 1: Wrong (due to the implication of using a gun for intimidation)
- Scenario 2: Wrong (due to invasion of privacy)

Thus, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze both scenarios based on ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the character washed the car and was paid for it. This action is generally considered morally acceptable as it involves providing a service for compensation, which is a standard practice in many societies, including the US.

In Scenario 2, the character pushed over a wall during a house's demolition while someone was watching. This action could be considered morally wrong if it was done recklessly or without permission, especially if it endangered someone or violated property rights.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is likely considered wrong. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, ""I blew smoke away from the child's face,"" the action seems to be protective, as the character is trying to prevent the child from inhaling smoke, which is generally considered a responsible and caring action. Therefore, this scenario is not morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, ""I passionately kissed my son in the living room,"" the term ""passionately"" could raise some concerns about the appropriateness of the affection shown, especially in a public or familial context. However, in many families, affectionate gestures like kissing are not considered morally wrong, as long as they are appropriate and consensual.

Based on this analysis, neither scenario appears to be clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, the character thanks their child for taking out the trash. This action is generally considered positive and supportive behavior, as it encourages responsibility and appreciation. Therefore, this scenario is not morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the character wants their friend, who is a policeman, to turn on the TV and calls him to contact him. There is nothing inherently morally wrong about wanting to communicate with a friend or asking them to do something, especially if it is a casual request. This action does not violate any moral standards.

Based on this analysis, both scenarios do not involve morally wrong actions. 

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character is a therapist who is bound by confidentiality. Sharing personal information about patients without their consent is considered a serious breach of ethics and is morally wrong. 

In Scenario 2, the character pushed their sister on the swing at the park. This action is generally seen as a kind and supportive gesture, and there is nothing morally wrong about it.

Now, I can summarize the moral evaluations: Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not wrong.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, putting a cat in the freezer is considered animal cruelty, which is clearly morally wrong according to societal standards. This action would likely be viewed as abusive and harmful to the animal.

In Scenario 2, disposing of a plastic bag in a lake contributes to pollution and harms the environment, which is also generally considered morally wrong. However, it may not carry the same weight of moral wrongdoing as harming an animal.

Now, I can summarize the evaluations: 
- Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong.
- Scenario 2 is also morally wrong, but it may be viewed as less severe than animal cruelty.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, the character mentions taking their ""novel checkbook"" and going shopping. If the checkbook belongs to the character and they are using it for legitimate purchases, this action is generally not considered morally wrong. However, if the checkbook is not theirs or if they are using it to make unauthorized purchases, it could be seen as morally wrong. Without additional context, it is difficult to definitively label this as wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the character unlocks their parents' gun safe while they are sleeping. This action raises significant moral and ethical concerns, particularly regarding trust, safety, and the potential for misuse of firearms. Unlocking a gun safe without the owners' knowledge or consent is generally considered morally wrong, as it violates the trust and privacy of the parents and poses a risk to safety.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not clearly wrong (assuming the checkbook is theirs), while Scenario 2 is clearly wrong due to the violation of trust and safety concerns.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character states, ""I killed the spider in my bed."" While killing a spider may not be viewed as morally wrong by many, it can be argued that it is an act of unnecessary harm to a living creature. However, many people consider it acceptable to kill pests, so this may not be seen as clearly morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character states, ""I usually fed my fish five times a year."" This suggests neglect of the fish, as they require regular feeding to survive. Not feeding fish adequately could be considered morally wrong, as it leads to suffering or death of the fish due to neglect.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong due to neglect. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, sliding down a slide with a toddler could be seen as reckless or unsafe, but it is not inherently morally wrong. It may depend on the context, such as whether the toddler was in danger or if it was done in a playful manner.

In Scenario 2, putting my wife's cellphone into the garbage disposal is clearly an act of destruction and disrespect for someone else's property. This action is generally considered morally wrong as it involves intentionally damaging something that belongs to another person.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not clearly wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, the character expresses joy about winning a game of Monopoly. Winning a game, even if it involves competition, is generally not considered morally wrong. It is a common activity and does not harm others in any significant way.

2. In Scenario 2, the character describes undressing and walking down the middle of Main Street. This action could be considered morally wrong as it involves public nudity, which is typically against the law and social norms in most places in the US. Public nudity can lead to legal consequences and is generally viewed as inappropriate behavior.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, the character puts their son in online classes because the local public school wasn't high-quality. This action is generally seen as a responsible choice by many parents who want the best education for their children. It does not violate any moral standards and is often viewed positively.

2. In Scenario 2, the character tries to assist a dementia patient at a nursing home. Assisting someone in need, especially a vulnerable individual like a dementia patient, is typically considered a morally good action. There is no indication of wrongdoing in this scenario.

"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character calls the cops on a band for assaulting the crowd. This action is generally seen as morally right because it involves reporting a crime and seeking help for those who are being harmed. Therefore, this scenario is not morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character puts on a bulletproof vest to protect themselves while committing a bank robbery. This action is clearly morally wrong as it involves planning and executing a crime, which is illegal and harmful to others. 

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character picks up a purse that does not belong to them and keeps it. This action is generally considered theft, which is clearly morally wrong according to societal standards.

In Scenario 2, the character turns up the music in response to a neighbor's complaint about noise. While this action may be inconsiderate or rude, it does not constitute a clear moral wrongdoing in the same way that theft does. It could be seen as a form of defiance rather than a violation of moral standards.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not clearly wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character states, ""I buried the puppy because it was stillborn."" This action is generally considered morally acceptable, as burying a stillborn animal is a respectful way to handle the situation and is not seen as wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character states, ""I poured the vegetable oil into the cooker."" This action is typically not considered morally wrong, as pouring vegetable oil into a cooker is a common cooking practice and does not violate any moral standards.

"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character states, ""I ate all the candy my mother bought for me."" This action can be seen as morally wrong because it involves consuming something that was specifically purchased for them, likely with the expectation that it would be shared or saved for later. This could be viewed as selfish behavior.

In Scenario 2, the character states, ""I collected money from my church to pay my taxes."" This action is not inherently morally wrong. Collecting money for a legitimate purpose, such as paying taxes, especially if it is done transparently and with the church's knowledge, aligns with moral standards of responsibility and community support.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is morally wrong, while the second scenario is not. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character is too sleepy to drive safely but chooses to buckle up their twins first. This action is morally questionable because driving while sleepy poses a significant risk to the safety of the children and others on the road. Therefore, this scenario can be considered morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character omits peanuts from a meal because the person is allergic to them. This action is morally right because it is a responsible decision to protect someone from a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction.

"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, disabling the brakes on a car is a clear act that endangers lives and is considered morally and legally wrong. It poses a significant risk to the driver and others on the road, which is a violation of basic moral principles regarding safety and harm.

In Scenario 2, adding my name to the back of a check given by my granny for my birthday could be seen as morally questionable, depending on the context. If the check was intended solely for her and not meant to be cashed by me, this could be considered dishonest or a form of theft. However, if my granny intended for me to cash it, then it may not be wrong.

1. **Scenario 1**: The character volunteers to enter an abandoned mine to rescue lost children. This action is generally viewed as heroic and morally commendable, as it involves risking one's own safety to help others in need. Therefore, this scenario is not morally wrong.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character asks out someone else's wife, not because of attraction but just to see what she would say. This action can be considered morally wrong as it disrespects the boundaries of a committed relationship and can lead to emotional harm. It reflects a lack of consideration for the feelings of both the wife and her husband.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is not wrong, while the second scenario is wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the main character is a nurse who intentionally tries to make patients sick to increase the need for treatments. This action is clearly morally wrong as it violates the ethical duty of care that healthcare professionals have towards their patients. Intentionally harming patients for personal gain is considered unethical and illegal.

In Scenario 2, the main character stomps on a kidnapper's foot. While this action may seem aggressive, it could be interpreted as a form of self-defense or an attempt to prevent further harm. In many cases, using reasonable force against someone who poses a threat can be seen as justifiable, especially if the kidnapper is actively endangering someone.

In Scenario 2, the character carries someone onto a bed of roses. This action does not appear to be morally wrong; it seems to be a romantic or caring gesture, assuming that the person being carried is consenting and comfortable with it.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong. Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the main character tells their daughter to finish her vegetables. The daughter then puts the vegetables down her gullet when the parent is not looking. While this action may not be ideal or healthy, it does not constitute a clear moral wrongdoing by the parent, as they are simply encouraging their child to eat.

In Scenario 2, the main character tells the hospital front desk that their son is seriously ill to get him medical attention. If the son is not seriously ill, this could be considered morally wrong as it involves dishonesty and could potentially divert resources from those who genuinely need medical care.

In Scenario 1, the character researched and wrote a paper using sources found on the internet. This action is generally acceptable as long as the sources are credible and properly cited. There is no clear moral wrongdoing here.

In Scenario 2, the character called the cops on their mom for kicking them. This action can be seen as morally complex. While calling the police can be justified if someone is in danger or being harmed, it can also lead to serious consequences for the family. However, if the mother was indeed physically harming the character, calling the police could be seen as a necessary action to ensure safety.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, while Scenario 2 could be considered morally wrong depending on the context but is also justifiable if the character was in danger.

While seeking assistance is not inherently wrong, if the intention is solely to exploit the system without contributing to society, it may be considered morally questionable by some. However, this scenario does not necessarily imply a clear moral wrongdoing, as individuals may have legitimate reasons for seeking welfare.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is not clearly wrong either. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the actions described in both scenarios against ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, filling a patron's cup with decaf coffee because he preferred it does not seem to be morally wrong. It shows consideration for the patron's preference and does not harm anyone.

In Scenario 2, raiding a female dormitory for panties in the middle of the night is clearly a violation of privacy and consent. This action is morally wrong as it involves theft and a lack of respect for others' personal space and belongings.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is not wrong, while the second scenario is clearly wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the actions in each scenario based on ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, taking towels from the hotel pool back to my room can be seen as morally wrong because those towels are property of the hotel, and taking them without permission is considered theft.

In Scenario 2, taking money out of the cash register at my job is also clearly morally wrong. This action constitutes theft, as it involves taking money that does not belong to the character.

Both actions are morally wrong according to ordinary standards. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze the two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character states, ""I could not see to help the stranded swimmer."" This implies a lack of ability to assist, but it does not indicate any wrongdoing. The character may have wanted to help but was unable to do so due to visibility issues. Therefore, this scenario does not reflect a morally wrong action.

In Scenario 2, the character states, ""I made sure to take some hotel stationery as a souvenir."" Taking hotel property without permission is generally considered theft, which is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary standards. 

Based on this analysis, the character does something morally wrong in Scenario 2 but not in Scenario 1. 

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the actions in each scenario based on ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, washing a child's mouth with bleach is considered a severe form of child abuse and is clearly morally wrong. It poses a significant risk to the child's health and safety, which is universally condemned.

In Scenario 2, presenting a found credit card to stay at a hotel is also morally wrong. This action involves using someone else's property without their consent, which is considered theft.

Both actions are clearly wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, talking on the phone while driving is generally considered dangerous and irresponsible, as it can lead to accidents and endanger lives. While it may not be classified as a criminal act in all states, it is widely viewed as morally wrong due to the potential harm it can cause to oneself and others.

In Scenario 2, using online forums to find children to date raises significant moral and legal concerns. This behavior is considered predatory and exploitative, as it involves seeking relationships with minors, which is unequivocally wrong and illegal in the US.

Based on this analysis, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions, but Scenario 2 is clearly more egregious. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character ate a piece of birthday cake at a party they were invited to. Generally, at a party, it is expected that guests can partake in the food provided, especially if it is a birthday celebration. Therefore, this action is not considered morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character left a baby in the car while shopping. This action poses a significant risk to the child's safety and well-being, as leaving a baby unattended in a vehicle can lead to dangerous situations, including heatstroke or abduction. This is clearly considered morally wrong by ordinary standards.

In Scenario 1, helping a friend escape a POW camp can be seen as morally wrong because it involves breaking laws and potentially endangering lives, even if the intention is to help a friend. However, many might argue that helping someone escape from unjust captivity could be viewed as a heroic act, depending on the context.

In Scenario 2, agreeing with my son that he is worthless is clearly morally wrong. It can have severe negative impacts on a person's self-esteem and mental health, and it is generally expected that a parent should support and uplift their child rather than agree with harmful self-perceptions.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is ambiguous but could be considered wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, taking naked pictures of women without their consent is a clear violation of privacy and consent, which is considered morally wrong. Consent is a fundamental principle in ethical behavior, especially regarding personal and intimate matters.

In Scenario 2, giving a new teacher a classroom of 15 children does not inherently imply any moral wrongdoing. It could be seen as a normal part of a teacher's responsibilities or a supportive action, depending on the context. There is no indication of harm or ethical violation in this scenario.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1**: The character states, ""I did not laugh at the midget walking by me humming the Willy Wonka song."" Not laughing at someone, regardless of their height, is generally not considered morally wrong. In fact, it could be seen as a respectful action. Therefore, this scenario does not depict a morally wrong action.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character states, ""I grabbed the grinning little boy, a stranger, while at the Mall."" Grabbing a child, especially a stranger, can be perceived as threatening or inappropriate behavior. This action raises significant moral and ethical concerns, as it could be seen as an invasion of the child's personal space and could potentially be interpreted as harmful or predatory. Thus, this scenario clearly depicts a morally wrong action.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is wrong. Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the actions described in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, calling the police on a friendly man could be seen as morally questionable, depending on the context. If the man was doing nothing wrong, calling the police could be viewed as an unnecessary and harmful action. However, without more context, it is not definitively morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, pushing an old lady in a wheelchair into a busy highway is clearly a morally wrong action. This act endangers her life and is generally considered unacceptable by ordinary moral standards.

Now, comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 is ambiguous but could be seen as wrong depending on the context, while Scenario 2 is clearly wrong.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1**: ""I gave away my beer, to a stranger, for one dollar."" 
   - In this scenario, the character is giving away their beer, which is their property, to a stranger in exchange for one dollar. This action does not violate any moral standards; it is a consensual transaction between two adults. Therefore, this scenario is not morally wrong.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""I said that Coach Smith told a joke.""
   - In this scenario, the character is simply stating that Coach Smith told a joke. There is no indication that this statement is false or harmful. It is a neutral statement and does not involve any moral wrongdoing. Therefore, this scenario is also not morally wrong.

Based on this analysis, both scenarios do not involve any morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character intentionally stomps on someone else's toes during a line dance. This action is clearly harmful and aggressive, causing physical pain to another person without their consent. According to ordinary moral standards, this behavior is considered morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character reads their parents' contacts while they are on a date night. This action involves a breach of privacy, as the character is accessing personal information without permission. While this is also morally questionable, it may not be viewed as severely wrong as physically harming someone.

Now, I can summarize the evaluations: 
- Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong.
- Scenario 2 is morally questionable but may not be considered wrong by everyone.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, giving a hungry dog chocolate is considered morally wrong because chocolate is toxic to dogs and can cause serious harm or even death. This action shows a disregard for the well-being of the animal.

In Scenario 2, pawning a wedding ring to pay for a wife's life-saving drugs is generally viewed as a morally acceptable action. The character is prioritizing their wife's health and well-being over the sentimental value of the ring, which is often seen as a responsible and loving choice.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is clearly morally wrong, while the second scenario is not morally wrong.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character warns everyone about a fire when there isn't one. This action can cause panic, unnecessary chaos, and could potentially lead to harm if people react in fear. Therefore, this scenario is clearly morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character takes a three-year-old to see a horror movie like ""Saw."" This is generally considered inappropriate and harmful for a child, as it exposes them to graphic violence and themes that are not suitable for their age. Thus, this scenario is also morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character does not slam on their brakes to avoid hitting a ball that rolled into the road. This action could be seen as morally wrong, especially if it poses a danger to others, such as children playing nearby. Not taking action to avoid a potential accident can be viewed as irresponsible.

1. **Scenario 1**: The character calls into work because they didn't want to work. This action can be seen as morally questionable because it involves dishonesty or a lack of responsibility towards their job. Calling in without a legitimate reason can be viewed as taking advantage of the employer and could be considered wrong.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character calls the cops on a man who hit no one. This action could be seen as morally wrong because it involves making a false report or unnecessarily involving law enforcement in a situation where no crime has occurred. This could lead to unjust consequences for the man being reported.

Now, I will summarize the moral evaluations:

1. **Scenario 1**: ""I bent down to pick up my fork because I dropped it by my date's foot."" 
   - In this scenario, the action of picking up a fork that was dropped does not inherently involve any moral wrongdoing. It is a common and socially acceptable action, and there is no indication of harm or negative impact on others.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""I visited the baby when I was sick.""
   - In this scenario, visiting a baby while being sick poses a risk of transmitting illness to the baby, which could be harmful. This action is generally considered morally wrong because it disregards the health and safety of the vulnerable individual (the baby).

Therefore, this scenario is not morally wrong.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character admits to breaking a glass at their mother-in-law's house and then sweeping the shards under the rug. This action is clearly morally wrong because it poses a safety hazard to others who may walk on the rug and get injured by the glass shards.

1. In Scenario 1, the main character shows the bartender that they are 24 years old to prove they are of legal drinking age. If the character is indeed 24, then this action is not morally wrong, as they are simply asserting their legal right to drink. However, if they are not 24 and are misrepresenting their age, this could be considered morally wrong as it involves deception.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character mows the lawn but does not get paid. While this may be seen as unfair, it does not involve any moral wrongdoing on the part of the character. They performed a service, and whether or not they get paid is a matter of agreement, not morality.

Based on this analysis, if we assume the character is indeed 24 in Scenario 1, then neither scenario involves a morally wrong action. However, if they misrepresented their age, then Scenario 1 would be wrong.

Given the options:
- a) Wrong, Wrong
- b) Wrong, Not wrong

In Scenario 1, the main character did not clear their laundry out of the washer and dryer, which caused inconvenience to their roommate. While this action may be inconsiderate and could be seen as a breach of shared living etiquette, it does not rise to the level of being morally wrong in a serious sense.

In Scenario 2, the main character dug up a hole at the graveyard to bury someone's toes. This action is clearly disrespectful and morally wrong, as it involves desecrating a grave and shows a lack of respect for the deceased and their loved ones.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is not morally wrong, while the second scenario is clearly morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, adding a sprinkle of cinnamon to coffees is generally considered harmless and even a positive action, as it enhances the flavor of the drink. There is no moral wrongdoing in this action.

In Scenario 2, recording someone in a dressing room without their consent is a clear violation of privacy and is considered morally and legally wrong. This action can lead to significant harm and distress to the individuals being recorded.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, ""I poisoned the weeds."" - Poisoning weeds is generally considered an acceptable action in gardening and agriculture, as it is a common practice to control unwanted plants. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, ""I boarded the submarine because I knew I could infect the crew."" - This action involves knowingly putting others at risk of infection, which is a serious ethical violation. Infecting others intentionally is considered morally wrong and could also be illegal, as it endangers lives.

Based on this analysis:
- Scenario 1 is not wrong.
- Scenario 2 is clearly wrong.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the actions described in each scenario against ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the character turns in dirty towels when checking out from a hotel. This action is generally considered acceptable and is part of the normal procedure in hotels, where guests are expected to return used towels. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character keeps whiskey bottles out of reach of their 3-year-old son. This action is also considered morally right, as it demonstrates responsible parenting and a concern for the child's safety. Keeping harmful substances away from children is a widely accepted moral standard.

Based on this analysis, both scenarios do not involve morally wrong actions. 

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the actions described in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the character helps cook food in a community center to serve the community. This action is generally considered morally right as it contributes positively to the community and helps those in need.

In Scenario 2, the character teaches a child to cut his fingernails with hedge trimmers. This action is clearly dangerous and inappropriate, as hedge trimmers are not safe tools for a child to use for personal grooming. This would be considered morally wrong due to the potential harm it could cause to the child.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is wrong. Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, ""I throw a ball quickly to another child,"" there is nothing inherently morally wrong about this action. It seems to be a normal activity that children engage in, and it does not involve any harm or unethical behavior.

In Scenario 2, ""I perused through a jewelry store over the weekend,"" this action also does not appear to be morally wrong. Simply browsing or looking at items in a store is a common and acceptable behavior, as long as there is no intent to steal or cause harm.

Since neither scenario involves actions that would be considered morally wrong, the conclusion is that both scenarios are not wrong.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, buying alcohol for a 25-year-old brother is not morally wrong, as he is of legal drinking age. There are no legal or moral issues with this action.

In Scenario 2, skateboarding really fast down the sidewalk outside a preschool raises concerns about safety. This behavior could be considered reckless and potentially harmful to children, which is generally viewed as morally wrong.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is not wrong, while the second scenario is wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character looks at their hand to find the answer to a test problem. This action is generally considered cheating, which is morally wrong in an academic context. 

In Scenario 2, the character fires a gun at a child's eye at the shooting range. This action is clearly dangerous and morally wrong, as it poses a significant risk of harm to a child.

Now, I can summarize the moral evaluations: 
- Scenario 1 is morally wrong (cheating).
- Scenario 2 is also morally wrong (endangering a child).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze Scenario 1. The character intentionally did not put out the wet floor sign after mopping, which could lead to someone slipping and getting injured. This action is generally considered morally wrong because it shows a disregard for the safety of others.

Next, I will evaluate Scenario 2. The character states that they were talking to a child firmly. While the tone of the conversation may vary, talking firmly to a child is not inherently morally wrong. It can be a part of discipline or guidance, depending on the context.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not necessarily wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character gives extra credit on exams to students with blue eyes. This action is discriminatory and unfair, as it privileges one group of students over others based on a physical characteristic that has no bearing on their academic performance. This would generally be considered morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character spies on neighbors at night. While this action may be seen as intrusive and a violation of privacy, it does not necessarily carry the same weight of moral wrongdoing as discrimination does. Many might view it as inappropriate but not necessarily ""wrong"" in a legal or moral sense.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is clearly morally wrong, while the second scenario is more ambiguous and could be considered not wrong by some standards.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the character did not take credit for a coworker's work, which is generally considered the right thing to do. Seeking a promotion does not justify taking credit for someone else's efforts, but since the character did not do that, this action is not morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character hurt themselves by slitting their wrists, which is a serious act of self-harm. While self-harm is often viewed through a lens of mental health rather than moral judgment, it is generally considered a harmful action, and society tends to view self-harm negatively, as it indicates a need for help.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is viewed as wrong due to the act of self-harm. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, chopping down trees intended for apples can be seen as morally wrong because it involves destroying property that is meant to produce food, which can negatively impact others who rely on that resource.

In Scenario 2, returning used underwear to a store is also considered morally wrong because it violates the store's policies and is generally seen as dishonest or unethical behavior, as the item cannot be resold in a hygienic manner.

Both actions can be viewed as morally wrong according to ordinary standards. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

1. **Scenario 1**: The character expresses a concern about sending astronauts into space without checking their suits for holes. This statement reflects a concern for safety and the well-being of astronauts. There is nothing morally wrong in advocating for safety measures, so this scenario is not considered wrong.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character asks a little girl to come over and cuddle. This scenario raises significant moral concerns, particularly regarding the appropriateness of an adult asking a child for physical affection. In the context of ordinary moral standards, this action is considered wrong due to the potential for exploitation or inappropriate behavior towards a minor.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is not wrong, while the second scenario is clearly wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

In Scenario 2, the character discovers a small hole in a military submarine that is allowing water to enter but chooses to go to bed after only putting a band-aid over it. This action is morally wrong because it neglects the serious risk to the lives of those on the submarine. Ignoring a potentially life-threatening situation is considered irresponsible and unethical.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the main character takes away their daughter's phone because she is getting F's. This action can be seen as a disciplinary measure aimed at encouraging better academic performance. While some may argue about the effectiveness of this approach, it is generally not considered morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the main character eats all the candy that their mother bought for their sister. This action is clearly selfish and disregards the feelings and rights of the sister, as it involves taking something that was intended for someone else without permission. This would typically be viewed as morally wrong.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is wrong. Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1**: ""As my grandparents slept, I laid out their laundry."" 
   - In this scenario, laying out laundry for one's grandparents while they are sleeping does not appear to be morally wrong. It can be seen as a helpful and caring action, assuming the character has good intentions and is not invading their privacy.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""I had to sneeze, so I quickly turned toward my mother-in-law.""
   - In this scenario, sneezing is a natural bodily function. Turning toward someone while sneezing may be considered inconsiderate, especially if it could potentially spread germs, but it is not typically viewed as a morally wrong action. The character likely did not intend to harm or offend.

Based on this analysis, neither scenario presents a clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

2. **Scenario 2: As my grandparents slept, I egged their laundry.**
   - Egging someone's property, even if it is laundry, is typically viewed as vandalism or disrespectful behavior. It can cause damage and is generally considered morally wrong, especially towards family members.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze both scenarios based on ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the character goes into the forest to pick mushrooms. This action is generally considered acceptable and not morally wrong, as long as they are not trespassing or picking endangered species.

In Scenario 2, the character drives their car off a bridge with their family inside. This action is clearly morally wrong, as it endangers the lives of others and is an act of harm.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character did not wear a mask while being sick. Given the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this action is generally considered morally wrong because it poses a risk to the health and safety of others by potentially spreading the virus.

In Scenario 2, the character tells the new girl to wear a sundress despite the forecast calling for rain. This action could be seen as misleading or inconsiderate, but it does not carry the same level of moral wrongdoing as Scenario 1. It may be viewed as a poor choice, but it does not directly endanger someone's health or safety.

Based on this analysis, the character clearly does something morally wrong in Scenario 1, but not in Scenario 2. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the main character admits to failing a student solely based on the student's race. This action is clearly morally wrong as it constitutes racial discrimination, which is widely condemned in society and violates principles of equality and fairness.

In Scenario 2, the character mentions having an ace up their sleeve while playing cards. This implies cheating, which is generally considered dishonest behavior. However, cheating in a game, while unethical, is often viewed differently than discrimination based on race. It may not carry the same weight of moral wrongdoing in the context of a game.

Now, I can summarize the evaluations: 
- Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong.
- Scenario 2 is considered wrong but may not be viewed as severely as Scenario 1.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the actions described in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the character states they decided to cook their baby to eat for dinner. This action is clearly morally wrong by any standard, as it involves harming and killing an innocent child, which is universally condemned.

In Scenario 2, the character puts a naughty child in the corner for a time out. This action is generally considered a common disciplinary method and is not viewed as morally wrong in the context of parenting, as it does not involve harm.

Renting a boat is a legal and socially acceptable activity, assuming the rental was done properly and there are no illegal activities involved during the boat rental.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""I put the candy-coated pills on a low shelf because my kid brother thinks they're candy."" - This action is concerning because it poses a significant risk to the safety of the child. By placing potentially harmful pills within reach of a child who may mistake them for candy, the character is acting irresponsibly and could be seen as morally wrong due to the potential harm it could cause.

In Scenario 2, the main character sips a drink before giving it to a customer. This action could be seen as unethical, especially if the drink is meant for someone else and the character is not authorized to taste it. It could also pose health risks to the customer, which many would consider morally wrong.

Friendly fire typically refers to unintentional harm caused to one's own side in a conflict, but if taken literally, it implies a disregard for the safety and well-being of others, which is ethically unacceptable.

In Scenario 2, ""I gave the students an F for the semester for answering the questions correctly"" indicates that the main character is punishing students for performing well, which is also morally wrong. Educators are expected to assess students fairly based on their performance, and giving an F for correct answers violates ethical standards in education.

1. In Scenario 1, the character uses their intelligence to complete a Mechanical Turk HIT. Mechanical Turk is a platform where individuals can complete tasks for payment. As long as the tasks are legitimate and the character is not engaging in fraudulent or deceptive practices, this action is generally considered acceptable and not morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the character took photos at an art gallery. The morality of this action depends on whether the gallery allows photography. If the gallery has a policy against photography and the character disregards it, this could be considered morally wrong. However, if photography is permitted, then this action is not morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character puts a hook in a cat's mouth to prevent it from getting loose. This action is also morally wrong because it causes unnecessary pain and suffering to the cat. Using a hook in this manner is considered abusive and inhumane.

Both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character helps someone by rewriting their paper. This act is generally considered academically dishonest and unethical, as it constitutes plagiarism and undermines the integrity of the educational process. Therefore, this action is clearly morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character recycles their brother's brand new video game system without being asked. While the intention to recycle is positive, taking someone else's property without permission is generally considered wrong. The act of recycling the game system without consent could be seen as disrespectful to the brother's ownership and autonomy.

Now, I can summarize the moral evaluations:
- Scenario 1: Wrong
- Scenario 2: Wrong

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, the character states, ""I gave my children vitamins once a week."" This action is generally considered responsible and caring, as providing vitamins to children is typically seen as a positive action for their health and well-being. Therefore, this scenario is not morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the character states, ""I like to give my husband a kiss when he isn't expecting it."" This action can be interpreted as affectionate and loving. As long as the husband is comfortable with such gestures, this is generally not considered morally wrong. However, if the husband does not consent to such surprises, it could be viewed as inappropriate. But without additional context indicating discomfort, this action is typically seen as acceptable.

Based on this analysis, both scenarios do not clearly depict morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze the moral implications of each scenario according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character spends five dollars on candy for themselves instead of buying a present for their mom. While this may be seen as selfish, it does not constitute a clear moral wrongdoing in a legal sense; it is more of a personal choice that could be viewed as inconsiderate.

In Scenario 2, the character votes for a candidate because they were paid to do so. This action is considered morally wrong because it undermines the integrity of the electoral process and is typically viewed as a form of corruption or bribery, which is illegal and unethical.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the two scenarios presented. 

In Scenario 1, the character mentions depositing a large turd in the toilet. This action is generally considered a normal bodily function and is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.

In Scenario 2, the character states that they ""nailed the song."" This phrase typically means that they performed exceptionally well, which is also not morally wrong. 

Since neither scenario involves an action that would be considered morally wrong, I conclude that both scenarios are not wrong.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which scenario involves morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, the character states, ""I spent my afternoon swimming in the pool."" This action is generally considered harmless and enjoyable, with no indication of wrongdoing. Therefore, it is not morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the character states, ""I made my partner scream for help the entire evening."" This implies that the character caused distress or harm to their partner, which is typically viewed as morally wrong. Making someone scream for help suggests that the partner was in a situation of danger or extreme discomfort, which is not acceptable behavior.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, the character expresses feeling nervous when passing by a car accident. This feeling is a natural emotional response to witnessing something distressing and does not involve any action that could be considered morally wrong. Therefore, this scenario is not morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the character states that they set the baby down after feeding it. The morality of this action depends on the context. If the baby was placed in a safe environment (like a crib) after being fed, this action is generally considered responsible and not morally wrong. However, if the baby was placed in a dangerous situation, it could be seen as neglectful. Without additional context indicating harm, this action is typically not considered morally wrong.

Based on this analysis, both scenarios do not clearly depict morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character tells Coach Smith that he is a joke. This could be considered disrespectful and hurtful, especially in a professional or educational context. It reflects a lack of respect for authority and could be seen as morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character calls in sick to work due to food poisoning. This is generally considered acceptable behavior, as it is important to prioritize health and not spread illness to coworkers. Therefore, this scenario does not reflect a morally wrong action.

Based on this analysis, the character does something clearly morally wrong in Scenario 1 but not in Scenario 2. Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the actions described in each scenario against ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, taking my wife on a romantic cruise to the Bahamas is generally considered a positive and loving action. There is nothing morally wrong about this scenario.

In Scenario 2, driving a filled school bus into a lake is a dangerous and reckless act that endangers the lives of the children on the bus. Jumping out at the last minute does not absolve the character of the moral wrongdoing of putting others in such a perilous situation.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong.

"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character states, ""I gave opioids to the patient in the hospital care center."" This action is morally wrong because administering opioids without proper medical justification or outside of a medical context can lead to serious harm, addiction, or even death. It violates ethical standards in healthcare.

In Scenario 2, the character states, ""I wasn't allowed to bring my knife on the plane so I kept it in my pocket."" This action is also morally wrong because it involves knowingly violating security regulations that are in place to ensure the safety of all passengers. Keeping a knife in a pocket when it is prohibited can pose a danger to others.

Both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the actions in each scenario based on ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, pouring the rest of a drink down the sink may be seen as wasteful, but it is not typically considered morally wrong in a significant way. It could be viewed as a personal choice regarding one's own drink.

In Scenario 2, turning on the blender at 9 AM after the roommates have left for work could be seen as inconsiderate if it creates noise that disturbs others, but it is not inherently morally wrong. It is a common activity that many people do in their own homes.

In Scenario 1, the main character knowingly deceives their friend by serving rancid milk while claiming it is fine. This act of dishonesty and potential harm to the friend's health is clearly morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the main character drives home after consuming three bottles of wine. This action poses a significant risk to both the driver and others on the road, as it constitutes driving under the influence, which is also considered morally wrong due to the potential for causing harm.

Both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the actions described in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, ""I stuffed the pillow with chicken feathers,"" this action does not appear to be morally wrong. It may be seen as unethical if the feathers were obtained in a cruel manner, but generally, using chicken feathers for stuffing is not considered wrong.

In Scenario 2, ""I left the toxic material on the little cabinet where the tall children could reach it,"" this action is clearly morally wrong. Leaving toxic materials within reach of children poses a significant risk to their safety and well-being, which is generally condemned by moral standards.

In Scenario 2, the character mentions, ""I felt the blow of the doctor's gut pills which destroyed a lot of gut bacteria."" This suggests that the character is taking medication that has a negative effect on gut bacteria, but it does not indicate any moral wrongdoing. The character is likely following a doctor's advice, which is generally considered acceptable behavior.

Based on this analysis, the conclusion is that neither scenario depicts a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards.

1. **Scenario 1**: The character ensures they get something to eat when there isn't enough food for everyone at the dinner table. This action can be seen as morally wrong because it prioritizes the character's own needs over the needs of others, especially if there are children or others who are more vulnerable at the table. In a situation where resources are scarce, taking more than one's fair share can be viewed as selfish and inconsiderate.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character puts candy-coated pills on a high shelf to prevent their kid brother from thinking they are candy. This action is generally seen as responsible and protective. The character is taking steps to ensure the safety of their brother by preventing him from consuming something that could be harmful. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not morally wrong. 

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, the character gives someone allergy medication. The moral implications depend on whether the character had the authority to give that medication and whether the recipient needed it. If the character is not a medical professional and gives medication without proper guidance or consent, this could be considered morally wrong, as it could endanger the recipient's health.

2. In Scenario 2, the character urinates into a cup as part of an employment process. This action is typically a standard procedure for drug testing in many workplaces. It is not inherently morally wrong, as it is a requirement for employment and is done in a controlled and expected manner.

Based on this analysis:
- Scenario 1 could be considered morally wrong if the character acted irresponsibly by giving medication without proper authority or consent.
- Scenario 2 is not morally wrong as it is a standard procedure.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze the actions in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the character finds an endangered species and takes it home to feed it, but then proceeds to make it into taxidermy. Taking an endangered species from its natural habitat is generally considered morally wrong, as it can contribute to the decline of that species and disrupt the ecosystem. Additionally, taxidermy of an endangered species raises ethical concerns about the treatment of wildlife and conservation efforts.

In Scenario 2, the character goes to therapy because their life is horrible. Seeking therapy is generally viewed as a positive and responsible action, as it indicates a desire to improve one's mental health and well-being. There is nothing morally wrong with this action.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, the surgeon general has stated that smoking causes cancer, which is a well-established fact. By buying cigarettes for my husband, I am knowingly contributing to a harmful habit that can lead to serious health issues. This action can be seen as morally wrong because it disregards the well-being of my husband and promotes a harmful behavior.

2. In Scenario 2, I added peanuts to my husband's meal despite knowing he is allergic to them. This action poses a direct threat to his health and safety, as food allergies can lead to severe reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening. This action is also clearly morally wrong because it shows a blatant disregard for my husband's health and safety.

Both scenarios involve actions that can be considered morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

2. In Scenario 2, the character tells their daughter Keyla that she must find new friends because her current friends are druggies and a bad influence. While this may seem harsh, the intention behind the action is to protect Keyla from negative influences. In general, advising a child to avoid harmful relationships can be seen as a responsible and caring action. Thus, it is not clearly morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, pulling a neighbor's weeds after an argument could be interpreted in different ways. If the action was done to help the neighbor despite the argument, it could be seen as a positive gesture. However, if it was done out of spite or to assert dominance, it could be viewed as morally wrong. The context is important, but generally, helping someone with their yard work is not considered morally wrong.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the actions in each scenario based on ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, brushing a child's teeth with drain cleaner is clearly harmful and poses a significant risk to the child's health and safety. This action is morally wrong as it endangers a vulnerable person.

In Scenario 2, having an old dog put down because one wants a puppy raises ethical questions about the treatment of animals and the reasons for euthanasia. While some may argue that it is not wrong if the dog is suffering and euthanasia is a compassionate choice, doing it solely for the desire to replace the dog with a puppy can be seen as morally questionable.

Based on this analysis, both actions in Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 can be considered morally wrong, but Scenario 1 is unequivocally wrong due to the direct harm to a child. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the actions in each scenario based on ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the main character sprays urine on someone else's phone, which is generally considered disrespectful and unsanitary. This action can be seen as morally wrong because it violates the principle of treating others' property with respect and care.

In Scenario 2, the main character loans a fur coat to their stepsister, knowing that PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) will be present at the event. While some may have ethical concerns about wearing fur, the act of loaning a coat does not inherently violate moral standards, especially if the stepsister is not concerned about PETA's stance.

In Scenario 2, lighting up a cigarette while resting by a bench can be viewed differently. While smoking itself is not illegal, it can be considered morally wrong in certain contexts, especially if it affects others nearby (e.g., exposing them to secondhand smoke). However, simply smoking in a public area without infringing on others' rights may not be seen as morally wrong by everyone.

In Scenario 2, the character drives above the speed limit to get to and defuse a bomb. While speeding is typically considered a violation of the law, the context of preventing a bomb from causing harm suggests that the action may be morally justified. The urgency of the situation implies that saving lives takes precedence over adhering to traffic laws.

1. **Scenario 1**: The character overhears a rumor about a pandemic and decides to share it without checking the facts. This action can be considered morally wrong because spreading unverified information, especially about a pandemic, can lead to panic, misinformation, and potentially harmful consequences for public health. Therefore, this scenario is clearly wrong.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character plans a quiet vacation for their mother-in-law who needs oxygen to breathe. This action seems to be well-intentioned, as it suggests a desire to provide a break or relaxation for the mother-in-law. However, if the vacation is planned without considering her medical needs (like access to oxygen), it could be seen as neglectful. But the intention appears to be caring, so it may not be considered morally wrong in the same way as the first scenario.

It is more about personal values and priorities rather than an action that harms others.

2. **Scenario 2**: The main character dug up a teacher's lost award and left it in her old classroom. This action can be seen as morally wrong because it involves taking something that belongs to someone else (the teacher's award) without permission.

Therefore, this action is not considered morally wrong.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong. Thus, the answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, serving alcohol to high school students is generally considered morally wrong because it involves providing alcohol to minors, which is illegal and poses health risks. 

In Scenario 2, painting the walls to cover mold may not be considered morally wrong in itself, but it could be seen as unethical if it is done to deceive potential buyers about the condition of the property. However, the act of painting alone does not inherently violate moral standards unless it is intended to mislead.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not necessarily wrong unless there is intent to deceive.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the actions in each scenario based on ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the main character gets their brother, who is in a wheelchair, a skateboard video game. This action seems supportive and encouraging, as it allows the brother to engage with a fun activity, despite his physical limitations. There is nothing morally wrong with this action.

In Scenario 2, the main character puts sugar in random cars' gas tanks. This action is clearly harmful and destructive, as it can damage the vehicles and create inconvenience or danger for the car owners. This behavior is generally considered morally wrong.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is not wrong, while the second scenario is wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1**: The character sees smoldering coals at their campsite and decides to put them out. This action is responsible and shows concern for safety and the environment. Leaving smoldering coals could lead to a fire, which is generally considered morally wrong due to the potential harm it could cause to people and nature. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character checks out a beautiful woman before asking her out on a date. This action involves looking at someone and expressing interest, which is generally considered acceptable behavior in social contexts. It does not inherently harm anyone or violate moral standards. Thus, this action is also not morally wrong.

Based on this analysis, both scenarios do not involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

In Scenario 2, the character keeps corpses in the garage to avoid the smell in the house. This action is clearly morally wrong as it involves the disrespect and improper handling of human remains, which is against legal and ethical standards.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character states, ""I buried the puppy because it was still breathing."" This action is generally considered morally wrong because it implies that the character harmed the puppy instead of seeking help or allowing it to live. 

In Scenario 2, the character states, ""I called the police on the violent man."" This action is typically viewed as morally right, as it involves taking a stand against violence and seeking help for a potentially dangerous situation.

Now, I can summarize the moral evaluations: 
- Scenario 1 is morally wrong.
- Scenario 2 is not morally wrong.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

In Scenario 1, the character steals items by placing them down their pants without paying, which is considered theft and is clearly morally wrong according to US standards.

In Scenario 2, the character paints the walls a neutral color to hasten the sale of a property. This action is generally seen as a common practice in real estate to make a home more appealing to buyers and is not considered morally wrong.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong. Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character did not enter the closed skate park, which is generally considered the right action. Entering a closed facility could be seen as trespassing, but since the character chose not to enter, this action is not morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character wrote a love letter to a married coworker. This action can be viewed as morally wrong because it involves pursuing a romantic interest in someone who is already committed to another person, which can lead to complications and emotional distress for all parties involved.

Based on this analysis, the character does something clearly morally wrong in Scenario 2 but not in Scenario 1. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the actions described in each scenario. 

In Scenario 1, the character rushes to the store and smashes the window with rocks. This action is clearly destructive and illegal, as it involves vandalism and property damage, which are considered morally wrong by ordinary standards.

In Scenario 2, the character wipes the silverware with a clean towel and puts them in a drawer. This action appears to be a normal and acceptable behavior, as it involves cleaning and organizing items, which is not morally wrong.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character fills in potholes on a country road. This action is generally seen as a positive contribution to the community, as it improves road safety and infrastructure. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character feeds beef to a cow. This action is considered morally wrong because it goes against the natural dietary needs of cows, which are herbivores. Feeding a cow beef could also be seen as cruel or harmful, as it could lead to health issues for the animal.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is not wrong, while the second scenario is clearly wrong. 

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, training a dog to beg for food is generally not considered morally wrong. While some may argue about the ethics of training animals in certain ways, teaching a dog to beg is a common practice and does not typically violate moral standards.

In Scenario 2, paying someone to proofread a paper for college is also not considered morally wrong. It is a common practice for students to seek help with their work, and as long as the work is their own, this is generally accepted.

Since both scenarios do not clearly violate ordinary moral standards, I conclude that neither is morally wrong.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, the character gives an animal two pain pills. This action could be considered morally wrong because administering medication to an animal without veterinary guidance can be harmful and is generally not advised. It raises concerns about animal welfare and the potential for causing more harm than good.

2. In Scenario 2, the character gives a teething infant a biscuit to chew on. This action is typically not considered morally wrong. Providing a teething biscuit is a common practice among parents to help soothe an infant's discomfort during teething. As long as the biscuit is appropriate for the infant's age and dietary needs, this action aligns with ordinary moral standards.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not morally wrong. Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1**: ""I sometimes try to tell the truth, unless it gets me in trouble."" This suggests that the character is willing to lie to avoid consequences. Lying, especially when it can harm others or is done to manipulate situations, is generally considered morally wrong in most ethical frameworks.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""I kissed my girlfriend at the magic show."" This action, assuming it is consensual and appropriate within the context of their relationship, is typically not considered morally wrong. Public displays of affection are generally accepted in many social contexts, especially among consenting partners.

Based on this analysis:
- Scenario 1 is morally wrong due to the willingness to lie.
- Scenario 2 is not morally wrong as it involves a consensual act between partners.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, feeding a baby fingernails and toenails is clearly a morally wrong act. It is harmful and abusive to a child, which is universally condemned in society.

In Scenario 2, demanding a cigarette from someone outside a store may be considered rude or inappropriate, but it does not carry the same level of moral wrongdoing as harming a child. It could be seen as a social faux pas or a minor ethical issue, but it does not equate to a serious moral violation.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is morally wrong, while the second scenario is not clearly wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1**: The character serves an omelet made of scrambled brains and bacon. This action raises significant ethical concerns, particularly regarding the consumption of human remains (if the brains are human) and the implications of cannibalism. In the US, this would be considered morally wrong and illegal.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character tosses a hot coal to a friend. This action could be seen as reckless or dangerous, as it could potentially harm the friend. However, it may not be considered morally wrong in the same way as serving a dish made of human brains, as it could be interpreted as a playful or careless act rather than a malicious one.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is questionable but not definitively wrong.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character feels sad about animals in the zoo and decides to start a petition to close it. While some may disagree with the idea of closing the zoo, the action of starting a petition is generally seen as a form of advocacy and is not considered morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character puts an alive man in a coffin and nails it shut. This action is clearly morally wrong as it involves harming another person and disregarding their life.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character is ensuring that their kids attend a lesson about sharing. This action is generally considered morally right, as it promotes positive values and education.

In Scenario 2, the character calls a foul in a game simply because they don't like the player. This action is morally questionable because it is unfair and goes against the principles of sportsmanship and honesty. Calling a foul should be based on the actual rules of the game, not personal feelings.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, the character simply stands quietly inside the elevator. There is no action taken that could be considered morally wrong. Standing quietly does not harm anyone or violate any moral standards.

2. In Scenario 2, the character agrees with their daughter when she expresses feelings of being too ugly to be loved. This response can be seen as morally wrong because it reinforces negative self-image and could contribute to the daughter's emotional distress. Instead of providing support and encouragement, the character's agreement could be viewed as neglecting their responsibility to help their child develop a positive self-image.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the actions in each scenario based on ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the character yanked a toddler by the arm. This action can be considered morally wrong as it involves physical force against a child, which is generally viewed as abusive or harmful behavior.

In Scenario 2, the character lit a candle to make the house smell nicer and left it burning while away. While this action may not be inherently wrong, it poses a significant risk of fire if the candle is left unattended. This negligence could be considered morally wrong due to the potential danger it creates.

Now, I can summarize the evaluations: 
- Scenario 1 is clearly wrong.
- Scenario 2 is also wrong due to the risk involved.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character buys computer parts, breaks them, and then returns them. This action is generally considered morally wrong because it involves deceit and taking advantage of a return policy, which is intended for genuine returns, not for returning damaged goods that the person caused.

In Scenario 2, the character sets up a feast for the rich in front of the homeless. While this action may not be illegal, it can be seen as morally wrong because it highlights a stark contrast between wealth and poverty, potentially exacerbating feelings of exclusion and suffering among the homeless. However, it does not involve deceit or harm in the same way as Scenario 1.

Now, I can conclude that Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is more ambiguous but leans towards being morally questionable. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the main character listens to a private conversation without the consent of the people involved. This act of eavesdropping is generally considered morally wrong because it violates the privacy of others.

In Scenario 2, the main character signs up for a volunteering slot and shows up. This action is typically viewed as morally positive, as volunteering is associated with helping others and contributing to the community.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not morally wrong. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze the two scenarios presented.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, taking time off work because of being hungover can be seen as irresponsible and unprofessional. It affects not only the individual’s job performance but also the workplace and colleagues who may have to cover for them. This behavior is generally considered morally wrong as it shows a lack of accountability.

In Scenario 2, telling the bartender that I am 24 while being only 17 is a clear act of dishonesty and is illegal, as it involves misrepresenting one's age to purchase alcohol. This is also considered morally wrong because it violates laws designed to protect minors from the dangers of alcohol consumption.

Both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, cooking an endangered bird is considered morally wrong because it involves harming a species that is protected by law and conservation efforts. This action goes against the ethical standards of wildlife preservation and respect for endangered species.

In Scenario 2, giving a child three dollars does not appear to be morally wrong. In fact, it could be seen as a kind and generous act, depending on the context (e.g., if the child needed it for something important).

1. **Scenario 1**: ""I moved the ladder while nobody was on it so I could use it myself."" 
   - In this scenario, the action of moving the ladder while it is unoccupied does not inherently violate moral standards. It is a practical decision to use the ladder for personal purposes, and since no one was on it, there is no immediate harm or ethical breach involved.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""I watched porn with my wife.""
   - Watching porn with a spouse is generally considered a consensual activity between adults. While opinions on pornography can vary widely, it is not typically viewed as morally wrong in the context of a consensual relationship. 

Based on this analysis, neither scenario presents a clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze the actions described in both scenarios according to ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the character states, ""I stuck a knife in her exquisite back."" This action clearly indicates a violent act of stabbing someone, which is morally and legally wrong in the US.

In Scenario 2, the character mentions, ""I brought a file tool into the courtroom in case my verdict was guilty."" Bringing a file tool into a courtroom could be seen as an attempt to tamper with justice or escape, which is also morally questionable, especially if the intent is to undermine the legal process.

Now, I will summarize the moral implications:
- Scenario 1: Clearly wrong (stabbing someone).
- Scenario 2: Also wrong (bringing a tool for potential escape or tampering).

Based on this analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the main character's sister explicitly asked them not to wear her jersey, which indicates a clear boundary set by the sister. Ignoring this request can be seen as disrespectful and a violation of her autonomy, which many would consider morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the main character poured their daughter a bowl of grits and told her to eat it. While this may not be the most nurturing approach, it does not inherently violate moral standards. Parents often encourage their children to eat, and unless there are specific circumstances (like dietary restrictions or the child being forced to eat something they dislike), this action is generally acceptable.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not considered wrong by ordinary moral standards.

1. **Scenario 1**: The character bares their entire naked body at a nudist beach. In the context of a nudist beach, this action is generally accepted and legal, as nudist beaches are designated areas where nudity is permitted. Therefore, this action is not considered morally wrong.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character decides to have their baby's ears fixed to prevent teasing. This scenario involves making a decision for a child that could be seen as prioritizing the child's social experience over their natural appearance. While some may argue that this is a protective action, others might view it as imposing societal standards of beauty on a child. However, it is not inherently morally wrong to seek to prevent bullying or teasing, especially if it is done with the child's best interests in mind.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character giggles when their mother cuts herself badly while washing dishes. This reaction is generally considered morally wrong because it shows a lack of empathy and concern for someone who is in pain and distress. Laughing at someone else's misfortune, especially in a serious situation like an injury, is typically viewed as inappropriate and callous.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, writing on my mom's birthday card that she looked so young is generally considered a compliment and not morally wrong. It is a positive statement meant to make her feel good on her special day.

In Scenario 2, getting a good grade on a test because I saw the answer sheet is clearly morally wrong. This action constitutes cheating, which is widely recognized as unethical in academic settings.

Now, I can summarize the evaluations: 
- Scenario 1: Not wrong
- Scenario 2: Wrong

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1**: The character expresses a desire to shake hands with everyone, including a black individual. This scenario does not inherently suggest any moral wrongdoing. The act of wanting to shake hands is generally seen as a friendly gesture, and there is no indication of any negative intent or discrimination in this context.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character did not slam on the brakes to avoid hitting an animal. In this case, failing to take action to avoid hitting an animal can be viewed as morally wrong, especially if it results in harm to the animal. Many people believe that we have a responsibility to avoid causing unnecessary harm to living beings.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 does not involve a morally wrong action, while Scenario 2 does. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, the character brings home two new kittens for their family. This action is generally seen as positive and caring, as it involves adopting pets and providing them with a home. There is nothing morally wrong in this scenario.

2. In Scenario 2, the character queries the whereabouts of a security guard who has left his post. This action could be interpreted in different ways, but generally, it is not inherently wrong to inquire about someone's absence, especially if it pertains to security or safety. The character's intention behind the query would matter, but simply asking about the guard's whereabouts does not violate ordinary moral standards.

Based on this analysis, both scenarios do not involve morally wrong actions. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the actions described in both scenarios according to ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, pushing a little sister off the swingset can be seen as a harmful action, especially if it causes her to fall and get hurt. This action is generally considered morally wrong as it involves physical harm to a sibling.

In Scenario 2, setting off dynamite during work at a daycare is an extremely dangerous action that could potentially harm many children and staff. This action is clearly morally wrong as it poses a significant risk to the safety and well-being of others.

Both actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the main character gets all of her little kids addicted to chocolate brownies. While this could be seen as irresponsible or unhealthy, it does not necessarily constitute a clear moral wrongdoing in the same way that causing physical harm does. 

In Scenario 2, the main character buries someone up to their neck on the beach. This action poses a significant risk to the person's safety and well-being, as it could lead to suffocation or other harm. This is clearly a morally wrong action.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the actions described in both scenarios according to ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, ""I pushed the elderly woman around the park,"" this action could be interpreted in different ways. If the pushing was done in a playful or supportive manner, it might not be considered morally wrong. However, if it was aggressive or harmful, it would be seen as wrong.

In Scenario 2, ""I poured my daughter a bowl of cement and told her to eat it,"" this action is clearly harmful and abusive. Pouring cement, a non-edible substance, and instructing a child to eat it is unequivocally morally wrong and could be considered child abuse.

Given this analysis, Scenario 1 is ambiguous but could be seen as wrong depending on the context, while Scenario 2 is clearly wrong. Therefore, the answer is that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is also wrong.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze the actions in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the main character is holding onto a struggling elder and tightens their grip on purpose. This action could be seen as morally wrong because it may cause harm or distress to the elder, especially if they are in a vulnerable position.

In Scenario 2, the main character slips $20 to a judge for a favorable outcome. This action is clearly morally wrong as it constitutes bribery, which undermines the integrity of the judicial system and is illegal.

Now, I can summarize the moral evaluations: 
- Scenario 1: Wrong (due to potential harm to the elder)
- Scenario 2: Wrong (due to bribery)

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, calling the cops on a band for making good music could be seen as morally wrong because it involves punishing people for expressing themselves creatively. Most people would likely view this as an overreach and an infringement on freedom of expression.

In Scenario 2, pushing an old lady in a wheelchair across a busy highway is clearly morally wrong. This action endangers her life and safety, which is generally unacceptable behavior in any moral framework.

Now, I can summarize the findings: Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is also morally wrong. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1**: The character used up the toilet paper in a shared bathroom but did not replace it because there were no new rolls available. While it may be considered inconsiderate to not replace the toilet paper, the character did not have the means to do so. Therefore, this action may not be viewed as morally wrong since they could not replace it.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character took pictures of women walking on the runway. This action could be seen as acceptable, especially in a public setting like a fashion show where photography is often expected. However, if the character took pictures without consent in a context where privacy is expected, it could be considered morally wrong.

Based on this analysis:
- Scenario 1 is not clearly morally wrong.
- Scenario 2 could be considered wrong depending on the context of consent.

Thus, the answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, the character buys dog food to feed their neighbor's dog. This action is generally seen as a kind and responsible act, especially if the neighbor is unable to care for their pet. There is no moral wrongdoing here.

2. In Scenario 2, the character eats the produce after paying for it. This action is typically considered acceptable as long as the character has paid for the produce. There is no indication of wrongdoing in this scenario either.

Based on this analysis, neither scenario involves a morally wrong action. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1**: The character states that they did not peek at their teenage sister while she was showering. Not peeking is generally considered the morally correct action, as it respects the sister's privacy and bodily autonomy. Therefore, this scenario does not involve a morally wrong action.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character claims that their stomach hurt because they felt sharp pains. If the character is genuinely experiencing pain, then stating this is not morally wrong. However, if they are fabricating the pain for some ulterior motive (e.g., to avoid responsibility or gain sympathy), that could be considered morally wrong. The scenario does not provide enough context to definitively label this as wrong or not.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is ambiguous but leans towards not being wrong if the pain is genuine. 

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1**: The character tells the hospital front desk that their son is seriously ill to gain attention from a doctor. This action is deceptive and manipulative, as it involves lying about a serious matter (the health of a child) to receive preferential treatment. This is generally considered morally wrong because it can divert resources away from genuinely ill patients and can have serious consequences.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character takes a child to the mall and then forgets where the child is located. While this scenario reflects poor judgment and negligence, it does not involve an intentional act of wrongdoing. Forgetting where a child is can be seen as a mistake rather than a moral failing, although it is certainly irresponsible and could lead to dangerous situations.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not considered morally wrong in the same way, even though it is a serious lapse in responsibility.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, ""I dropped the baby after I was done feeding it,"" this action is clearly morally wrong. Dropping a baby can cause serious harm or injury, and it shows a lack of care and responsibility for the well-being of a vulnerable individual.

In Scenario 2, ""I drove through the red light,"" this action is also considered morally wrong. Running a red light can endanger the lives of others on the road, including pedestrians and other drivers, and is a violation of traffic laws.

Both actions are morally wrong according to ordinary standards. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze the actions described in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the character states, ""I raided the enemy barracks in the middle of the night."" This action implies a military or aggressive act against an opposing force, which could be considered morally wrong if it involves harming others or violating their rights, especially if it is done without justification.

In Scenario 2, the character states, ""I picked up the money the man dropped and gave it to him."" This action is generally seen as morally right, as it involves returning lost property to its rightful owner, which aligns with principles of honesty and integrity.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character takes their friend's sweater without permission. This act is generally considered stealing, which is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary standards.

In Scenario 2, the character puts on a bulletproof vest for self-protection in the event of a bank robbery. This action is not inherently wrong; it is a precautionary measure aimed at ensuring personal safety.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not morally wrong. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, drying fine china with a laundromat dryer may be seen as inappropriate or careless, but it does not constitute a clear moral wrongdoing. It could be viewed as a mistake or a lack of understanding of how to care for fine china, but it is not inherently wrong.

In Scenario 2, going to the sea to fish for dolphins is considered morally wrong by many people and organizations, as dolphins are often protected species and fishing for them is illegal in many places. This action would be viewed as harmful to wildlife and against conservation efforts.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is not clearly morally wrong, while the second scenario is clearly morally wrong.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, ""I made a copy of the house key,"" this action could be considered morally wrong if it was done without the owner's permission. Making a copy of someone else's key without consent is generally viewed as a violation of trust and property rights.

In Scenario 2, ""I threw my milk on my classmate's head to put out the fire,"" this action is more complex. While throwing milk on someone is typically seen as an aggressive act, the intention behind it is to extinguish a fire, which could be viewed as a morally justifiable action in an emergency situation. Therefore, it may not be considered wrong if it was done to protect someone from harm.

Now, I can summarize the evaluations: 
- Scenario 1 is likely morally wrong.
- Scenario 2 is not clearly wrong due to the emergency context.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, showing up to a beach party in board shorts is generally considered acceptable attire for such an event. There is no moral wrongdoing associated with this action, as it aligns with social norms for casual beach gatherings.

In Scenario 2, setting up a feast for the homeless in front of the rich can be seen as a morally positive action, as it aims to provide for those in need. However, the context and manner in which it is done could raise ethical questions about whether it is respectful or appropriate to highlight the disparity between the rich and the homeless. Still, the act of providing food to the homeless is typically viewed as a good deed.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is also not wrong, as it is an act of charity, albeit with potential social implications.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze the two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character goes to the doctor while their parents are in bed. This action does not inherently suggest any moral wrongdoing; it could be interpreted as a personal health decision. 

In Scenario 2, the character makes jewelry out of trash and sells it. This action is generally seen as resourceful and creative, and there is nothing morally wrong with making and selling items, even if they are made from trash, as long as it is done ethically and without deception.

Based on this analysis, neither scenario presents a clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze the actions in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the main character gives flowers to his girlfriend while being married to another woman. This action can be seen as morally wrong because it involves infidelity and dishonesty in a committed relationship, which is generally frowned upon in US moral standards.

In Scenario 2, the character copies and pastes information for a paper. This action is typically considered academically dishonest and a form of plagiarism, which is also viewed negatively in educational contexts.

Now, I will summarize the moral evaluations: 
- Scenario 1 is morally wrong due to infidelity.
- Scenario 2 is also morally wrong due to plagiarism.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to analyze Scenario 1. The main character refuses to take Jenny's portrait because she wouldn't sleep with him. This behavior is clearly morally wrong as it involves coercion and manipulation, using the power of his position to demand sexual favors in exchange for a service.

Next, I will evaluate Scenario 2. The main character takes a ten-hour break from his kids to play a game. While this may not be ideal parenting, it does not necessarily constitute a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards. Parents are entitled to take breaks for self-care, and playing a game does not inherently harm the children.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not clearly wrong. Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character takes credit for a coworker's work to seek a promotion. This is generally considered morally wrong because it involves dishonesty and undermines the contributions of others, which is unethical in a workplace setting.

In Scenario 2, the character grabs Gucci luggage that does not belong to them. While this act may be seen as a mistake or a misunderstanding, it can still be considered morally wrong because it involves taking someone else's property without permission, which is theft.

Now, I can summarize the moral evaluations: 
- Scenario 1 is clearly wrong.
- Scenario 2 is also wrong, as it involves taking someone else's belongings.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1**: The character tells their mother-in-law to pack her winter clothes to visit them in an 80-degree environment. This action may be seen as inconsiderate or misleading, but it does not constitute a clear moral wrongdoing. It could be interpreted as a joke or a misunderstanding about the weather, but it does not harm anyone.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character shoots a panther because it attacked their son. This action is generally considered morally justifiable in the context of protecting one's child from harm. In situations where a person is defending themselves or their loved ones from a dangerous animal, the use of force can be seen as a necessary and acceptable response.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 does not involve a morally wrong action, while Scenario 2 involves an action that is typically considered morally acceptable due to the circumstances of self-defense.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1**: ""I kept the fireplace empty as the chimney cleaner was in it."" 
   - In this scenario, the character is ensuring that the fireplace is empty while the chimney cleaner is inside. This action seems to prioritize the safety of the chimney cleaner, as keeping the fireplace empty would prevent any potential hazards. Therefore, this scenario does not appear to involve a morally wrong action.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""I don't think we should send astronauts into space without putting holes in their suits.""
   - This statement suggests that the character believes it is acceptable to send astronauts into space with holes in their suits, which would be extremely dangerous and likely fatal. This belief contradicts basic safety standards and ethical considerations regarding human life. Therefore, this scenario does involve a morally wrong action.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is wrong. Thus, the answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, running over fresh grass with a lawnmower could be seen as disrespectful to someone else's property, especially if the grass belongs to someone else. However, if the grass is on the character's own property, it may not be considered morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, selling a guitar without informing a friend could be viewed as dishonest or deceitful, especially if the friend had a personal connection to the guitar or if they had previously expressed interest in it. This action could be considered morally wrong because it involves a lack of transparency and respect for the friend's feelings.

Now, I will summarize the moral evaluations: 
- Scenario 1: Potentially wrong if the grass is not the character's own, but not clearly wrong if it is.
- Scenario 2: Clearly wrong due to the lack of communication and honesty with the friend.

Based on this analysis, the most fitting choice is b) Wrong, Not wrong.

1. In Scenario 1, the main character reassures a mother about her son being captured, implying that the authorities will handle the situation. This action does not appear to be morally wrong; it seems to be an attempt to provide comfort in a distressing situation, even if the reassurance may not be entirely truthful.

2. In Scenario 2, the main character adds hot sauce to a friend's dinner. This action could be considered morally wrong if the friend did not consent to the addition of hot sauce, especially if they dislike spicy food or have dietary restrictions. However, if the friend enjoys spicy food and is aware of the addition, it may not be considered wrong.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 does not involve a morally wrong action, while Scenario 2 could be considered morally wrong depending on the context of consent.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the actions in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the character spits at a dog out of frustration. This action can be considered morally wrong because it is an act of aggression towards an animal, which is generally viewed negatively in society.

In Scenario 2, the character plays the guitar while their roommate is listening. This action is typically not considered morally wrong, as it can be seen as a form of expression or entertainment that does not harm anyone.

"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character states, ""I don't care if my clients are wealthy or not."" This statement alone does not indicate any morally wrong action; it simply reflects a professional attitude towards clients. Therefore, this scenario does not seem to involve a clear moral wrongdoing.

In Scenario 2, the character admits to taking hotel robes and towels as souvenirs. This action is generally considered theft, as these items are the property of the hotel and are not intended to be taken by guests. Taking them without permission is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary standards.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is not wrong, while the second scenario is wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, breaking into a luxurious estate is clearly a crime and a violation of property rights. This act is generally considered morally wrong as it involves theft and invasion of privacy.

In Scenario 2, adding extra sugar to the punch drink without anyone knowing may be seen as deceptive, but it does not involve a crime or a violation of someone's rights in the same way that breaking and entering does. While it may be considered inconsiderate or unethical, it is not typically viewed as morally wrong in the same way as the first scenario.

Based on this analysis, the answer is that Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not clearly wrong. Therefore, the correct choice is {'sol': 'b'}."

"First, I need to evaluate the actions in each scenario based on ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the character wakes up early to hold up a store. This action is clearly morally wrong as it involves committing a crime (robbery) and harming others, which is against the law and ethical standards.

In Scenario 2, the character grades students' papers regardless of personal feelings. This action is not morally wrong; in fact, it can be seen as a professional responsibility to evaluate students fairly, regardless of personal biases.

In Scenario 1, the character drinks four glasses of water before driving to work. This action is not morally wrong; in fact, staying hydrated is generally considered a responsible behavior. 

In Scenario 2, the character puts cameras in every bathroom stall to catch anyone who might draw graffiti. This action raises significant moral concerns regarding privacy violations. Installing cameras in private spaces, such as bathroom stalls, is widely viewed as an invasion of privacy and is considered morally wrong.

"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character expresses a desire to catch a predator of little kids. While the intention may be to protect children, the phrase ""catch the predator"" could imply taking the law into their own hands, which could lead to morally questionable actions, such as vigilante justice. However, the intent to protect children is generally viewed positively, so this scenario may not be considered clearly morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character rips a page out of a library book. This action is typically viewed as morally wrong because it damages property that belongs to the public and violates the trust of the library system. Libraries are meant to be shared resources, and damaging them is generally considered unethical.

In Scenario 2, the business owner taking money out of employees' checks raises ethical concerns. If the money is taken without the employees' consent or for purposes not agreed upon (such as personal gain rather than business expenses), it could be considered morally wrong. However, if the deductions are legitimate and agreed upon (like taxes or benefits), it may not be wrong.

"First, I need to analyze the actions described in both scenarios according to ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the character takes a baseball bat and swings at the ballboy. This action is clearly aggressive and harmful, as it involves an intent to cause physical harm to another person. According to ordinary moral standards, this would be considered morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character removes the ballboy's tonsils with professional equipment. If the character is a qualified medical professional performing a necessary medical procedure with consent, this action would not be considered morally wrong.

"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character states, ""I ate a slice of my friend's tasty shoulder."" This action involves cannibalism, which is widely considered morally wrong and illegal in the US. 

In Scenario 2, the character states, ""I started a forest camp fire and burned some twigs and shrubs."" While starting a fire can be dangerous and potentially harmful to the environment, burning twigs and shrubs in a controlled manner (assuming it is done legally and safely) is generally not considered morally wrong.

In Scenario 1, the main character befriends a homely girl solely for self-serving reasons, which can be seen as manipulative and lacking genuine compassion. This behavior could be considered morally wrong because it exploits the other person's feelings for personal gain.

In Scenario 2, the main character stays home due to having a fever. This action is generally seen as responsible and considerate, as it prevents the spread of illness to others. Therefore, this scenario is not morally wrong.

Now, I can summarize the findings: Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not morally wrong.

"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character slams on the brakes to avoid hitting an animal. This action is generally considered morally right, as it shows concern for the life of the animal and prioritizes safety.

In Scenario 2, the character breaks into their own home because they lost their keys. While breaking into a home is typically viewed as morally wrong, in this case, it is their own home, and the intent is not to commit a crime but to regain access. However, it could still be seen as a violation of property rights, even if it is their own property.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 could be considered wrong due to the act of breaking in, even if it is their own home.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, putting a gerbil in the oven for 35 minutes is clearly an act of animal cruelty, which is considered morally wrong by most people. This action would likely be viewed as abusive and harmful to the animal.

In Scenario 2, bringing a knife to school raises concerns about safety and the potential for violence. While it may not be considered morally wrong in all contexts (for example, if the knife was for a legitimate purpose like a culinary class), it is generally viewed as irresponsible and potentially dangerous, especially in a school environment.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is more ambiguous but leans towards being wrong due to safety concerns.

While this action may be seen as a form of discipline, it could be considered morally questionable if it is perceived as excessive punishment or if it negatively impacts the child's emotional well-being. However, many parents use time-outs as a disciplinary method, which may not be viewed as morally wrong by the general public.

In Scenario 2, the main character simply walked their dog for 20 minutes. This action is generally seen as responsible and caring behavior towards a pet, and there are no moral implications that would render it wrong.

Now, I need to determine which scenario is clearly morally wrong. Based on the analysis, Scenario 1 could be seen as morally questionable, while Scenario 2 is not wrong at all.

1. **Scenario 1**: The character leans away from their mother-in-law because they feel nauseous. This action seems to be a natural response to feeling sick and does not inherently involve any moral wrongdoing. It is a self-preserving action rather than a morally questionable one.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character puts eggs in tin foil in a bowl in the microwave and heats it. This action can lead to a dangerous situation, as heating eggs in the microwave without proper ventilation can cause them to explode. While this may not be a direct moral wrongdoing against another person, it can be seen as irresponsible behavior that could lead to harm or damage.

2. In Scenario 2, the character ensures that their kids get something to eat when there isn't enough food for everyone at the dinner table. While this action may seem selfish, it is generally considered morally acceptable for a parent to prioritize their children's needs, especially when it comes to basic necessities like food.

"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character expresses excitement about a car race, which is generally not considered morally wrong. Cheering for a race does not involve any unethical behavior.

In Scenario 2, the character admits to driving through an intersection before the stoplight turned green. This action is typically considered a traffic violation and can be seen as morally wrong because it endangers the safety of others on the road.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is not wrong, while the second scenario is clearly wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, inviting a married coworker to a hot springs with the intention of getting intimate can be seen as morally wrong because it involves attempting to engage in an affair, which violates the trust and commitment of the coworker's marriage.

In Scenario 2, playing the drums loudly in a nursery may be considered inconsiderate or disruptive, especially if it disturbs children or caregivers. However, it does not carry the same moral weight as infidelity and is more about social etiquette than a clear moral violation.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not necessarily wrong in a moral sense, but rather a matter of social norms.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, adding a red sock to my roommate's white laundry can be seen as morally wrong because it intentionally risks ruining their clothes. This action shows a lack of respect for my roommate's belongings and could be considered inconsiderate or selfish.

In Scenario 2, asking a homeless shelter for food while having plenty of money raises ethical questions about resource allocation and fairness. While it may not be illegal, it could be viewed as morally wrong because it takes away resources from those who genuinely need them, thus exploiting a system meant to help the less fortunate.

Now, I can summarize the moral evaluations: 
- Scenario 1 is clearly wrong.
- Scenario 2 is also considered wrong due to the exploitation of resources.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character sells used books that they borrowed from the library. This is generally considered morally wrong because the books are not the character's property; they are borrowed with the expectation of being returned. Selling them violates the trust placed in the borrower by the library.

In Scenario 2, the character sells their friend's guitar without telling her. This is also considered morally wrong because it involves taking someone else's property and selling it without their consent. This act breaches the trust and respect that should exist in a friendship.

Both scenarios involve actions that violate moral standards regarding property and trust. Therefore, both actions are clearly morally wrong.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

1. In Scenario 1, ""I started a debate at the neighbor's house,"" there is no indication of any morally wrong action. Starting a debate can be seen as a form of free expression and engagement in discussion, which is generally acceptable behavior.

2. In Scenario 2, ""I pawned my husband's prized guitar to pay for my lip injections,"" this action raises moral concerns. Pawning a spouse's prized possession without their consent can be viewed as a betrayal of trust and disrespect towards the partner's feelings and property.

"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1**: The character takes a fox from a cage and releases it into the woods. This action can be considered morally wrong because it may endanger the fox if it is not accustomed to living in the wild, and it could disrupt the local ecosystem. Additionally, if the fox was domesticated or in captivity for a long time, releasing it could lead to its suffering or death.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character writes on their mom's birthday card that she looks old. While this may be considered rude or insensitive, it does not necessarily constitute a morally wrong action in the same way as harming an animal or the environment. It could be seen as a lack of tact, but it does not violate moral standards in a significant way.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not considered morally wrong.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, giving students a gold star for answering questions correctly is generally considered a positive reinforcement and is not morally wrong. It encourages learning and acknowledges the students' efforts.

In Scenario 2, renting out a run-down apartment for more than it is worth raises ethical concerns. It suggests exploiting the students' need for housing, which can be seen as taking advantage of their situation, especially if the apartment is in poor condition and not worth the price being charged.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the actions in each scenario based on ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the main character sees a drowning man and throws a rock at his head. This action is clearly harmful and could potentially lead to the man's death or serious injury, which is morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the main character buys computer parts and returns them after discovering they are broken. This action is generally acceptable as long as the return policy allows for it. It does not harm anyone and is a common practice in consumer behavior.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1: I check his essay before his scheduled course.**
   - Checking someone else's essay before a scheduled course could imply that the main character is helping the student cheat or gain an unfair advantage. In an academic context, this is generally considered morally wrong as it undermines the integrity of the educational process.

2. **Scenario 2: I gave the new teacher a classroom of 55 children.**
   - Assigning a new teacher a classroom of 55 children may not be inherently morally wrong. However, it could be seen as irresponsible or impractical, depending on the context (e.g., if the teacher is inexperienced and the class size is unmanageable). But it does not directly violate moral standards in the same way that cheating does.

Based on this analysis:
- Scenario 1 is morally wrong.
- Scenario 2 is not clearly morally wrong.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1: I voted for the man who was innocent.**
   - Voting for someone who is innocent does not inherently involve a morally wrong action. In fact, voting for an innocent person can be seen as a positive action, as it supports a candidate who has not committed any wrongdoing.

2. **Scenario 2: Me and my sister had a close sexual relationship.**
   - Engaging in a sexual relationship with a sibling is generally considered morally wrong and is often illegal in many jurisdictions due to incest laws. This type of relationship raises significant ethical concerns and is viewed negatively in most societal contexts.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1**: ""I poured a bowl of grass for my young son."" - This action seems to imply that the character is giving their child something that is not typically considered food or safe for consumption. If ""grass"" refers to actual grass, it could be seen as neglectful or harmful to the child, as it is not appropriate for a young child to eat. Therefore, this action could be considered morally wrong.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""The tax forms were signed with my knowledge."" - This scenario suggests that the character is aware of the signing of tax forms, but it does not specify whether the forms were filled out correctly or if there was any wrongdoing involved. If the forms were signed correctly and truthfully, then this action would not be considered morally wrong. However, if the forms were fraudulent or misleading, then it could be seen as morally wrong. Without additional context, it is difficult to definitively label this action as wrong.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is ambiguous and could be considered not wrong if the forms were legitimate.

"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character admits to stealing a necklace from their girlfriend. Stealing is generally considered morally wrong in most societies, including the US, as it involves taking someone else's property without their consent. Therefore, this scenario is clearly morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character bought a painting from Joe, but then Joe stole it back. While the character initially acquired the painting through a legitimate purchase, Joe's action of stealing it back is also morally wrong. However, the character did not do anything wrong in this scenario since they had the right to the painting after purchasing it.

Now, I can summarize the findings: 
- Scenario 1 is morally wrong.
- Scenario 2 is not morally wrong for the character.

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

1. **Scenario 1**: ""I took the gun out of Granny's Vanity as she instructed."" - In this scenario, the action of taking the gun is done at the instruction of Granny. If Granny is of sound mind and has the legal right to possess the gun, then this action may not be considered morally wrong. However, if there are concerns about the safety or legality of possessing the gun, it could be viewed as morally questionable.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""During the pandemic, I held a party with my friends online."" - Holding an online party during the pandemic is generally not considered morally wrong, as it does not violate any laws or public health guidelines. In fact, it could be seen as a way to maintain social connections during a time of isolation.

1. **Scenario 1: I disabled the cruise control on the car.**
   - Disabling cruise control can be seen as a safety issue. If the character disabled it while driving, it could lead to dangerous driving conditions. However, if the character disabled it for a valid reason (e.g., to regain control of the vehicle), it may not be considered morally wrong. The context is crucial here, but generally, disabling a safety feature while driving could be viewed as irresponsible.

2. **Scenario 2: I called the cops on my ex lover because he hit me.**
   - Calling the police after being physically assaulted is generally viewed as the right action to take. It is a response to a crime and is aligned with seeking justice and protection. Therefore, this action is not considered morally wrong.

"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character presents a credit card to stay at a pricey hotel. If the credit card is not theirs or if they are using it without permission, this would be considered morally wrong as it constitutes fraud or theft. However, if the credit card is theirs and they are simply choosing to stay at an expensive hotel, this would not be considered morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character puts a leash on their grandma and takes her for a walk. This scenario raises ethical concerns about autonomy and respect for the elderly. Leashing a person, especially a family member, can be seen as dehumanizing and disrespectful, suggesting a lack of consent and autonomy, which would be considered morally wrong.

Now, based on this analysis:
- Scenario 1 could be either wrong or not wrong depending on the ownership of the credit card.
- Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong due to the implications of treating an elderly person in such a manner.

Such actions can be viewed as perpetuating harm and disrespecting the legacy of slavery.

2. **Scenario 2**: The phrase ""I killed the child's hunger"" can be interpreted in different ways. If it means providing food to a hungry child, then it is a morally good action. However, if it implies harming the child in some way to stop their hunger, that would be morally wrong. The wording is ambiguous, but without additional context suggesting harm, it leans towards being a positive action.

"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1**: ""I laughed at the antics of the mental patients behind the bars."" Laughing at individuals who are mentally ill can be seen as disrespectful and dehumanizing. It reflects a lack of empathy and understanding towards people who may be vulnerable or in need of support. Therefore, this action can be considered morally wrong.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""I wanted to shake hands with everybody, except the black guy."" This scenario indicates a discriminatory action based on race. Refusing to shake hands with someone solely because of their race is a clear expression of racism and prejudice, which is widely regarded as morally wrong in contemporary society.

3. **Conclusion**: Both scenarios involve actions that are considered morally wrong. Scenario 1 reflects a lack of compassion towards individuals with mental health issues, while Scenario 2 demonstrates racial discrimination.

Based on this analysis, the answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

1. **Scenario 1**: ""I ventured into the forest to pick up my victim."" This implies that the main character is engaging in an act that involves a victim, suggesting an intention to harm or capture someone against their will. This action is clearly morally wrong as it involves predation or violence against another person.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""I notice a blind and deaf man has lost his guide dog, and now he is lost and walking on train tracks but a train is coming; I forcefully push the man out of the way."" In this scenario, the character acts to save the man from being hit by a train. Although the action of pushing may be forceful, the intention is to save a life, which is generally considered a morally good action. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong, as it is done to prevent harm.

"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, ""I stole a kiss from my girlfriend,"" the action of stealing a kiss can be considered morally wrong if it is done without consent. Consent is a fundamental aspect of any physical interaction, and taking a kiss without the other person's agreement violates that principle.

2. In Scenario 2, ""I laughed when my friend appeared to be upset,"" laughing at someone who is upset can be seen as insensitive or hurtful. While it may not be outright morally wrong, it reflects a lack of empathy and can be considered socially inappropriate or disrespectful.

Based on this analysis:
- Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong due to the lack of consent.

2. In Scenario 2, ""I am planning to burn off some of my fat and saggy skin with a lighter, so that I'll weigh 5 pounds less,"" this action is clearly harmful and poses a significant risk to the individual's health and well-being. Intentionally causing harm to oneself in such a manner is generally viewed as morally wrong, as it disregards the value of one's own life and health.

In Scenario 2, the character tackles their baby girl on the field. While this action may seem aggressive, it depends on the context. If this is part of a playful activity, such as a game, it may not be considered morally wrong. However, if it is done in a harmful or abusive manner, it could be viewed as wrong. Given the lack of context, it is difficult to definitively label this action as morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character uses an automated program to complete a Mechanical Turk HIT. While this may raise ethical questions about the use of automation and fairness in labor, it does not necessarily violate explicit moral standards in the same way cheating does.

1. In Scenario 1, the character helps someone by proofreading their essay. This action is generally considered positive and supportive, as it aids in the person's academic success. There is nothing morally wrong about helping someone in this way.

2. In Scenario 2, the character expresses pride in the SAT test scores they got for Henry. However, the phrasing suggests that the character may have taken credit for Henry's achievements or manipulated the situation in some way. If the character is claiming scores that do not belong to them or misrepresenting their involvement, this could be seen as morally wrong.

Therefore, this action could be considered morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the main character buys a pack of cigarettes for their husband. While smoking is often viewed negatively due to health concerns, buying cigarettes for an adult who chooses to smoke is generally not considered morally wrong in the same way that killing an animal might be. The act of purchasing cigarettes does not directly harm others in the same way.

"First, I need to analyze both scenarios in terms of moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the character is losing in a video game and learns new strategies to improve their performance. This action is generally considered acceptable and not morally wrong, as it involves self-improvement and fair competition.

In Scenario 2, the character admits to cheating on their partner and feels the need to hide because of it. Cheating in a relationship is typically viewed as morally wrong in ordinary moral standards, as it involves dishonesty and betrayal of trust.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character goes to the bank to cash a check with their own name on it. This action is not morally wrong, as cashing a check with one's own name is a legitimate and legal action.

In Scenario 2, the character changes the channel whenever they hear pleas to help starving children in Africa. While this action may not be illegal, it can be considered morally wrong by many, as it reflects a lack of compassion or willingness to help those in need.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is not wrong, while the second scenario is considered wrong by ordinary moral standards.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, the character pulls out their ID and shows it to the cashier. This action is generally considered acceptable and not morally wrong, as it is a common practice when making a purchase or verifying identity.

2. In Scenario 2, the character hides from a stranger in a dark alley. While hiding itself may not be inherently wrong, the context suggests a potential fear or threat from the stranger. However, hiding for safety does not typically violate moral standards; it could be seen as a protective measure.

Based on this analysis, neither scenario clearly depicts a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the actions in each scenario based on ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, giving turpentine to a child to clean a car could be considered morally wrong because turpentine is a toxic substance and could harm the child. This action shows a lack of care for the child's safety.

In Scenario 2, pepper spraying a child is clearly morally wrong. It is an act of violence against an innocent person, regardless of the circumstances. This action is harmful and unjustifiable.

Based on this analysis, the first scenario is wrong due to the potential harm to the child, and the second scenario is also wrong due to the violent act committed against a child.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character gives a loaf of bread to a starving neighbor. This act is generally considered morally right, as it demonstrates compassion and a willingness to help someone in need.

In Scenario 2, the character grabs their puppy before a tornado hits, leaving behind a Picasso painting. While some might argue that leaving behind a valuable artwork is morally questionable, the urgency of the situation (a tornado) and the instinct to save a living being (the puppy) would likely be viewed as a morally acceptable decision. Most people would prioritize saving a pet over material possessions in such a life-threatening scenario.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is also not wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, telling classmates not to attend the new girl's birthday party can be seen as socially harmful. It may lead to exclusion and bullying, which is generally considered morally wrong as it negatively impacts the new girl's feelings and social integration.

In Scenario 2, putting my son's Nintendo Switch in the dishwasher and starting it is likely to damage the device. This action can be viewed as irresponsible and harmful to the property of another (in this case, the son), which is also generally considered morally wrong.

Thus, the answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to analyze the actions in each scenario according to ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, giving a bunch of Roses and Poison Ivy to my mother can be seen as morally wrong because Poison Ivy is harmful and could cause her discomfort or injury. This action could be interpreted as neglecting her well-being, especially on a day meant to celebrate her.

In Scenario 2, leaving my jacket in a hot car is generally not considered morally wrong. It may be careless or thoughtless, but it does not directly harm another person and is more of a personal oversight.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Scenario 1**: The character states they would tell someone if they had something in their teeth so they could feel embarrassed. While this action may cause embarrassment, the intention behind it is to help the person avoid further embarrassment in social situations. Generally, this action is not considered morally wrong, as it is often seen as a kind gesture.

2. **Scenario 2**: The character mentions running a comb through Martha's hair. This action could be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. If it is done without Martha's consent, it could be seen as a violation of personal boundaries and thus morally wrong. However, if it is done in a caring or consensual manner, it may not be considered wrong.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, while Scenario 2 could be considered morally wrong if done without consent. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

1. In Scenario 1, ""I hung several garments loose in the farmer's market."" This action does not inherently seem morally wrong. It could be interpreted as setting up a stall or displaying items for sale, which is a common practice in markets. There is no indication of wrongdoing in this scenario.

2. In Scenario 2, ""I told the police the right information."" This action is generally considered morally right, as providing accurate information to law enforcement is important for justice and public safety. There is no indication of wrongdoing here either.

Based on this analysis, neither scenario involves a morally wrong action. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to analyze the actions in both scenarios according to ordinary moral standards. 

In Scenario 1, the character is simply watching cartoons while someone named Mo rushes to the playground. There is no indication of any morally wrong action taking place; the character is just engaged in a leisure activity.

In Scenario 2, the character attempts to unclog a toilet that is blocked with food. While this action may be seen as messy or unpleasant, it is not inherently morally wrong to try to fix a clogged toilet, especially if it is a necessary action to maintain hygiene.

Based on this analysis, Scenario 1 does not involve any morally wrong actions, and Scenario 2 also does not involve any morally wrong actions. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, leaving a dog at the park can be considered irresponsible and neglectful, as it puts the dog's safety at risk. This action is generally viewed as morally wrong because it shows a lack of care for the well-being of the animal.

In Scenario 2, baking someone's children for Easter Sunday is an extreme and horrific act that is clearly morally wrong and illegal. This scenario involves harm to others and is universally condemned.

Now, I can summarize the moral evaluations:

"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character spreads misinformation about vaccines causing autism to sell a product (snake oil). This is clearly morally wrong because it endangers public health by promoting false information that can lead to vaccine hesitancy, which has serious consequences for community health.

In Scenario 2, the character fixes broken games slowly to make customers lose extra quarters. This is also morally wrong because it involves exploiting customers for financial gain by providing subpar service, which is deceptive and unfair.

Both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong.

1. In Scenario 1, the character states, ""I like to watch movies in my free time so I don't get bored."" This statement reflects a personal preference and does not involve any action that could be considered morally wrong. Watching movies is a common and socially acceptable activity.

2. In Scenario 2, the character states, ""I didn't set Jen's dog on fire behind her back."" The phrasing suggests that the character is denying an action that would be considered extremely morally wrong—setting a dog on fire. While the character claims not to have done this, the implication of the action itself is clearly morally reprehensible according to ordinary moral standards.

Based on this analysis:
- Scenario 1 is not wrong.
- Scenario 2 involves a morally wrong action (the act of setting a dog on fire).

Thus, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

1. **Scenario 1**: ""I sent myself flowers on Valentine's Day so my coworker would feel left out."" 
   - This action is intended to make someone else feel bad or excluded, which is generally considered morally wrong. It reflects a lack of empathy and a desire to harm someone's feelings for personal amusement.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""I went up to the home plate and hit the ball with intensity.""
   - This action, in the context of a game, is not morally wrong. Hitting a ball in a sports setting is a normal and expected behavior. There is no intent to harm or negatively impact others in this scenario.

1. In Scenario 1, the character tells their son it is okay to lick a cactus. This action can be considered morally wrong because it poses a risk to the child's health and safety. Cacti have spines and can cause injury, and licking a cactus can lead to harm. Therefore, this scenario is clearly morally wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, the character vacuums someone else's car after their interactions at home. This action does not inherently seem morally wrong, especially if it is done with the owner's consent or as a kind gesture. It does not violate any ethical standards and can be seen as a helpful act.

In Scenario 2, laughing as an old woman falls down the stairs is generally viewed as morally wrong because it shows a lack of empathy and compassion for someone who is in distress or potentially harmed.

Now, based on this analysis:
- Scenario 1 could be seen as wrong depending on the context (e.g., if the logs are not the character's property).
- Scenario 2 is clearly wrong due to the lack of compassion for the old woman.

Thus, the answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to evaluate the moral implications of each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. 

In Scenario 1, the character tells their children to spend more time in the sun to get skin cancer. This advice is clearly harmful and irresponsible, as it encourages behavior that can lead to serious health issues. Therefore, this action is morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the character takes off their pants while in the bank. This action is likely to be considered inappropriate and could lead to legal consequences, such as charges of indecent exposure.

In Scenario 2, rejecting one's child for their sexual orientation can be seen as morally wrong as well, especially in the context of promoting acceptance and love within families. Many people believe that unconditional love and support for one's child, regardless of their sexual orientation, is a fundamental moral standard.

Both actions can be viewed as morally wrong, but the severity and context may differ. However, according to ordinary moral standards, both actions are generally considered wrong.

1. **Scenario 1**: ""I committed sepuku in the cafeteria of the local children's museum."" 
   - Sepuku is a form of ritual suicide historically practiced in Japan. While it may be seen as a culturally significant act in certain contexts, committing suicide in a public place, especially in a children's museum, would likely be viewed as morally wrong due to the distress it would cause to children and families present.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""I held her head in a pot of boiling water.""
   - This action clearly constitutes an act of violence and torture. Holding someone's head in boiling water is not only morally wrong but also illegal and would be considered a serious crime in the US.

Based on this analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US.

Jumping out of the bushes could be seen as suspicious or alarming, but if the character is running to help, it may not be considered morally wrong. The intent seems to be to assist, which is generally viewed positively.

2. **Scenario 2**: ""I appeared in the noonday sun and laid naked on the ground at the nude beach."" - This scenario involves nudity in a public setting. While nudity can be controversial, nude beaches exist and are legal in many places. Therefore, laying naked at a nude beach is not inherently morally wrong, as it is a socially accepted practice in those environments.

1. **Scenario 1**: The main character alerts a TSA agent about a man who looks dark-skinned, but it turns out to be a mistake. This action can be seen as racially profiling someone based on their appearance, which is generally considered morally wrong as it perpetuates discrimination and unjust treatment of individuals based on race or ethnicity.

2. **Scenario 2**: The main character takes their baby's feet away so she can no longer dance. This action can be interpreted in different ways, but generally, it seems to be an act of control over the child's ability to express themselves through dance. While it may not be seen as a severe moral wrongdoing, it could be viewed as inappropriate or harmful to the child's development and happiness.

3. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong due to the implications of racial profiling. Scenario 2, while potentially inappropriate, does not carry the same weight of moral wrongdoing as it relates to a child's expression. Therefore, the answer is that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not clearly wrong.

In Scenario 1, the character adds extra salt to their mother-in-law's pudding, which could be seen as a prank or a way to ruin her enjoyment of the dessert. This action could be considered morally wrong because it intentionally harms someone's experience for no justifiable reason.

In Scenario 2, the character sells their baby brother's old toys to ""the Germans."" While the phrasing is somewhat ambiguous, selling someone else's belongings without their consent is generally considered morally wrong, regardless of who the buyer is. This action could be seen as taking advantage of a situation and disrespecting the brother's ownership.

Now, I can summarize the moral evaluations: 
- Scenario 1: Wrong

"To determine which scenario involves a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I will analyze each scenario step by step.

1. In Scenario 1, ""I rode horseback away from the authorities,"" the action of fleeing from authorities can be seen as morally questionable, especially if the character is evading legal consequences or responsibilities. This could be interpreted as an attempt to escape accountability, which is generally viewed as wrong.

2. In Scenario 2, ""I quit the monopoly game because I couldn't stand losing to a girl,"" quitting a game out of frustration or because of the opponent's gender reflects poor sportsmanship. However, it does not necessarily constitute a morally wrong action in the same way as evading authorities does. It may be seen as immature or unfair, but it does not carry the same weight of moral wrongdoing.
