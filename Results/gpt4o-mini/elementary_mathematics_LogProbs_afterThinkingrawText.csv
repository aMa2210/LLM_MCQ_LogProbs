"First, I need to determine how many soccer balls the team can buy with their budget of $90.00. To do this, I will divide the total amount of money by the cost of one soccer ball.

The cost of one soccer ball is $15.60. So, I calculate:

90.00 ÷ 15.60 = 5.7692 (approximately).

Since the team cannot buy a fraction of a soccer ball, I will round down to the nearest whole number. This means the team can buy a maximum of 5 soccer balls.

Now, I will check if buying 5 soccer balls is within the budget:

5 soccer balls × $15.60 = $78.00.

This amount is less than $90.00, confirming that the team can afford 5 soccer balls.

Next, I will check if they can buy 6 soccer balls:

6 soccer balls × $15.60 = $93.60.

This amount exceeds the budget of $90.00, so they cannot buy 6 soccer balls.

Therefore, the greatest number of soccer balls the team can buy is 5.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to set up the equation based on the information given. The total cost for four tickets is $112, so I can express this as 4 times the cost of one ticket (t): 

4t = 112.

"First, I need to convert the mixed number ""1 and 1 over 11"" into an improper fraction. The whole number 1 can be expressed as 11 over 11 (since 1 = 11/11). 

Next, I add the fraction part (1 over 11) to this improper fraction: 
11 over 11 + 1 over 11 = (11 + 1) over 11 = 12 over 11.

Now, I check if 12 over 11 is in its simplest form. Since 12 and 11 have no common factors other than 1, it is already in simplest form.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

```

Next, I subtract starting from the rightmost digit:
- In the hundredths place: 6 - 0 = 6
- In the tenths place: 7 - 5 = 2
- In the units place: 2 - 6 requires borrowing, so I take 1 from the 4 (making it 3), and the 2 becomes 12. Thus, 12 - 6 = 6.
- In the tens place: 3 - 1 = 2
- In the hundreds place: 1 - 0 = 1

Putting it all together, the result is 126.26.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

"First, I need to calculate the mean and median of the original list of numbers: 1, 3, 3. 

To find the mean, I add the numbers together: 1 + 3 + 3 = 7. Then, I divide by the number of values, which is 3: 7 ÷ 3 = 2.33 (approximately).

Next, to find the median, I arrange the numbers in order (which they already are) and find the middle value. Since there are three numbers, the median is the second number, which is 3.

Now, I will add the number 6 to the list, making it: 1, 3, 3, 6. 

To find the new mean, I add the numbers: 1 + 3 + 3 + 6 = 13. Then, I divide by the new number of values, which is 4: 13 ÷ 4 = 3.25. The mean has increased from approximately 2.33 to 3.25.

Next, I will find the new median. The new list is 1, 3, 3, 6. Since there are now four numbers, the median is the average of the two middle numbers (the second and third values): (3 + 3) ÷ 2 = 3. The median remains the same.

In conclusion, the mean increases, but the median does not change. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

"First, I need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: 1, 5, 9, 13. 

Next, I can observe the differences between consecutive terms:
- The difference between 1 and 5 is 4.
- The difference between 5 and 9 is also 4.
- The difference between 9 and 13 is again 4.

This indicates that the pattern increases by 4 each time. 

Now, I can find the next two terms by adding 4 to the last term (13):
- The next term after 13 is 13 + 4 = 17.
- The term after that is 17 + 4 = 21.

Thus, the next two terms in the pattern are 17 and 21. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to determine the cost of one can of pears. Since 3 cans cost $2.37, I can find the cost of one can by dividing the total cost by the number of cans: 

Cost per can = $2.37 / 3 = $0.79.

Next, I need to find out how many cans I can buy for $9.48. To do this, I divide the total amount of money I have by the cost of one can:

Number of cans = $9.48 / $0.79 ≈ 12 cans.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to convert all the numbers into a comparable format, preferably decimals. 

1. The number 3 is already in decimal form: 3.0.
2. The fraction 3 and 1 over 8 can be converted to decimal: 3 + 1/8 = 3 + 0.125 = 3.125.
3. The number 3.8 is already in decimal form: 3.8.

"First, let's define the number of birds Keiko counted in the afternoon as \( x \). According to the problem, she counted 34 more birds in the morning than in the afternoon, which means she counted \( x + 34 \) birds in the morning.

Next, we know that the total number of birds counted is 76. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
x + (x + 34) = 76
\]

Now, let's simplify the equation:

\[
2x + 34 = 76
\]

Next, we will subtract 34 from both sides:

\[
2x = 76 - 34
\]
\[
2x = 42
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to find \( x \):

\[
x = 21
\]

Thus, Keiko counted 21 birds in the afternoon. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

4. Finally, I will add these values together: 5 + 30 = 35, and then 35 + 48 = 83.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"To determine which situation can be represented by the fraction 20/8, I will analyze each option step by step.

a) Leslie spent 20 dollars and 8 cents at a store. This situation does not represent a fraction because it involves a monetary amount rather than a ratio of two quantities.

b) Mr. Kramer’s 8 grandchildren shared 20 crackers equally. In this case, the fraction 20/8 represents the number of crackers each grandchild would get when 20 crackers are divided among 8 grandchildren. This is a valid representation of the situation.

c) Mitch bought 20 containers of flowers at a plant store. Each container had 8 flowers in it. Here, the total number of flowers would be calculated as 20 containers * 8 flowers/container = 160 flowers. This situation does not represent the fraction 20/8.

d) Stamps are sold in booklets of 20 stamps. Donna used 8 stamps to send invitations for a party. This situation does not represent a fraction because it does not involve dividing or sharing a quantity.

"First, I need to identify the pairs of whole numbers that have a least common multiple (LCM) of 60 and are both less than or equal to 12. The pairs must also have a greatest common factor (GCF) of 2.

1. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^1. For two numbers to have an LCM of 60, their prime factors must combine to include these factors.
2. The GCF of the two numbers is 2, which means both numbers must be even, and they can be expressed as 2a and 2b, where a and b are whole numbers.
3. The possible pairs of numbers that are less than or equal to 12 and have a GCF of 2 are:
   - (2, 6)
   - (2, 10)
   - (4, 6)
   - (4, 10)
   - (6, 10)
   - (6, 12)

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to find the prime factors of 77. I can start by dividing 77 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 77 is odd, it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, I try dividing by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. The sum of the digits of 77 (7 + 7 = 14) is not divisible by 3, so 77 is not divisible by 3 either.

Now, I will try dividing by 5. Since 77 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Next, I try dividing by 7. When I divide 77 by 7, I get 11 (77 ÷ 7 = 11). Both 7 and 11 are prime numbers.

Thus, the prime factorization of 77 is 7 and 11, which can be expressed as 7^1 • 11^1. However, since we are not using exponents for 1, the prime factorization can simply be written as 7 • 11.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

"First, I need to identify the pattern in the sequence. The numbers given are 20, 40, 60, 80. To find the common difference, I can subtract the first number from the second number: 40 - 20 = 20. 

Next, I can confirm that this difference is consistent by checking the next pairs: 60 - 40 = 20 and 80 - 60 = 20. This shows that the pattern increases by 20 each time.

Now, to find the eighth number in the pattern, I can start from the first number (20) and add the common difference (20) a total of 7 times (since the first number is the first in the sequence). 

Calculating this:
- 1st number: 20
- 2nd number: 20 + 20 = 40
- 3rd number: 40 + 20 = 60
- 4th number: 60 + 20 = 80
- 5th number: 80 + 20 = 100
- 6th number: 100 + 20 = 120
- 7th number: 120 + 20 = 140
- 8th number: 140 + 20 = 160

"First, I need to calculate the total cost of the uniforms. Each uniform costs $46, and the school is buying 12 uniforms. 

To find the total cost, I can express it as:
Total Cost = Cost per Uniform × Number of Uniforms
Total Cost = 46 × 12

Next, I can break down the cost of $46 into two parts: $40 and $6. This gives me:
Total Cost = (40 + 6) × 12 = (40 × 12) + (6 × 12)

Now, I can calculate each part:
- (40 × 12) = 480
- (6 × 12) = 72

So, the total cost can be expressed as:
Total Cost = 480 + 72

Looking at the options provided, the equation that matches this calculation is:
c) (40 × 12) + (6 × 12) = 480 + 72

3. The common factors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The greatest common factor is 12.

Next, I will divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD (12):

- 60 ÷ 12 = 5
- 72 ÷ 12 = 6

So, 60 over 72 simplifies to 5 over 6.

Now, I will check the answer choices to find the correct one. The simplified form 5 over 6 matches choice d.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to convert both measurements to the same unit. Since 1 quart (qt) is equal to 4 cups, I can convert 3 qt to cups: 

3 qt = 3 * 4 cups = 12 cups.

Now, I have 2 cups and 12 cups. The ratio of 2 cups to 12 cups can be expressed as a fraction:

Ratio = 2 cups / 12 cups = 2/12.

Therefore, the estimate of Kerri's total time for all four races is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to isolate the variable x in the equation \( \frac{3}{4} x = 24 \). To do this, I can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \), which is \( \frac{4}{3} \).

So, I multiply both sides by \( \frac{4}{3} \):
\[
x = 24 \times \frac{4}{3}
\]

Next, I calculate \( 24 \times \frac{4}{3} \). First, I can simplify \( 24 \div 3 = 8 \), and then multiply by 4:

"First, I need to understand the relationship between the number of girls and boys at West Elementary School. The problem states that there are 20 more girls than boys. 

Next, I know that there are 180 girls. To find the number of boys, I can set up the equation based on the information given: 

Let the number of boys be represented as B. According to the problem, the number of girls (180) is equal to the number of boys (B) plus 20. This can be expressed as:
180 = B + 20.

Now, to find the number of boys, I need to isolate B. I can do this by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:
B = 180 - 20.

Calculating this gives me:
B = 160.

- The first 4 (in the hundreds place) represents 400.
- The second 4 (in the tens place) represents 40.
- The third 4 (in the ones place) represents 4.
- The first 4 after the decimal (in the tenths place) represents 0.4.
- The second 4 (in the hundredths place) represents 0.04.

Now, let's evaluate each statement:

a) The value of the 4 in the tenths place (0.4) is not 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place (40). In fact, 0.4 is 1/100 of 40.

b) The value of the 4 in the hundredths place (0.04) is indeed 1/10 the value of the 4 in the ones place (4). This is true because 0.04 is 1/10 of 0.4, which is 1/10 of 4.

c) The value of the 4 in the hundreds place (400) is 100 times greater than the value of the 4 in the ones place (4), not 10 times greater.

d) The value of the 4 in the tenths place (0.4) is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the hundredths place (0.04). This is true because 0.4 is indeed 10 times 0.04.

After evaluating all statements, the true statements are b) and d). However, since we need to select one, we can choose the first true statement we found, which is b).

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to calculate the unit rate by dividing the total distance by the total time. The total distance is 308 kilometers and the total time is 4 hours.

Next, I perform the division: 308 km ÷ 4 h = 77 km/h.

Since 77 km/h is already a whole number, there is no need to round.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to consider the typical sizes of swimming pools in cities. Most public swimming pools are designed for recreational use and competitive swimming, which usually range from about 25 meters to 50 meters in length.

Next, I can eliminate the extremes. A 1 meter pool would be too small for any practical swimming use, and a 25 kilometer pool would be impractically large for a city swimming pool.

Now, between the remaining options, 25 meters is a common length for many public swimming pools, especially for lap swimming, while 1 kilometer is more typical for larger aquatic facilities or competitive venues, which are less common.

Given these considerations, the most reasonable estimate for the length of a city’s swimming pool is 25 meters.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to calculate the total time for the 3 sets that are 20 minutes each. This is 3 sets * 20 minutes/set = 60 minutes.

Next, I need to account for the 10-minute breaks between the sets. There are 3 breaks (one after each of the first 3 sets), so the total break time is 3 breaks * 10 minutes/break = 30 minutes.

Now, I add the time for the 1 set that is 40 minutes. 

So, the total length of the music showcase is:
60 minutes (for the 3 sets) + 30 minutes (for the breaks) + 40 minutes (for the 1 set) = 130 minutes.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To find the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 24 and 36, I will follow these steps:

1. First, I will find the prime factorization of both numbers:
   - The prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 * 3^1.
   - The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2.

2. Next, I will identify the highest power of each prime factor present in both factorizations:
   - For the prime factor 2, the highest power is 2^3 (from 24).
   - For the prime factor 3, the highest power is 3^2 (from 36).

3. Now, I will multiply these highest powers together to find the LCM:
   LCM = 2^3 * 3^2 = 8 * 9 = 72.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to determine how many one-cup servings of soup Chesa will make this year. Since she is making two times the amount she made last year, I calculate: 32 servings * 2 = 64 servings.

Next, I need to convert the total number of one-cup servings into gallons. There are 16 cups in a gallon, so I divide the total number of servings by 16: 64 servings ÷ 16 cups/gallon = 4 gallons.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To determine the most popular football team at a game, I need to consider which method would yield the most representative sample of the fans present at the game.

1. **Surveying the cheerleaders for the home team (Choice a)**: This method would likely yield biased results, as cheerleaders are typically supporters of the home team and may not represent the overall fan base.

2. **Surveying people wearing hats for the visiting team (Choice b)**: This could provide some insight into the visiting team's popularity, but it may not capture the full picture of the overall fan base at the game, especially if the number of visiting fans is small.

3. **Surveying a group of people standing in line for tickets (Choice c)**: This method is likely the most effective, as it includes a mix of fans who are attending the game, regardless of which team they support. It provides a more balanced view of the popularity of both teams.

4. **Surveying people who do not live in the home team’s city (Choice d)**: This method may not be effective, as it could exclude many local fans who are likely to support the home team.

Based on this analysis, the best method for Emil to find out the most popular football team at the game is to survey a group of people standing in line for tickets. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to determine the ratio of blue cars to white cars. The company makes 5 blue cars for every 3 white cars, which gives a ratio of 5:3.

Next, if the company makes 15 white cars in one day, I can find out how many sets of 3 white cars are in 15. This is calculated as 15 ÷ 3 = 5 sets.

Since each set of 3 white cars corresponds to 5 blue cars, I can now calculate the total number of blue cars made by multiplying the number of sets by the number of blue cars per set: 5 sets × 5 blue cars/set = 25 blue cars.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to calculate the volume of one baseball card case using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length × width × height.

1. The length of the case is 12 centimeters.
2. The width of the case is 6.5 centimeters.
3. The height of the case is 1.25 centimeters.

Now, I will multiply these dimensions together:

Volume = 12 cm × 6.5 cm × 1.25 cm.

Calculating this step-by-step:

- First, calculate the area of the base: 12 cm × 6.5 cm = 78 cm².
- Next, multiply the area of the base by the height: 78 cm² × 1.25 cm = 97.5 cm³.

Therefore, the volume of one baseball card case is 97.5 cubic centimeters.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to determine how many bunches of roses Chris sold by dividing the total amount collected by the price per bunch. The total amount collected is $339.80, and the price per bunch is $16.99.

Next, I perform the division: 
339.80 ÷ 16.99 ≈ 20.00.

This calculation indicates that Chris sold approximately 20 bunches of roses.

Finally, I check the options provided to confirm that 20 is one of the choices. The correct answer is therefore {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to understand that the 48 vanilla milkshakes represent 40% of the total number of milkshakes sold. To find the total number of milkshakes, I can set up the equation where 48 is 40% of the total.

Next, I can express this mathematically as:
\[ 0.40 \times \text{Total Milkshakes} = 48 \]

To find the total number of milkshakes, I can rearrange the equation:
\[ \text{Total Milkshakes} = \frac{48}{0.40} \]

Now, I will calculate:
\[ \text{Total Milkshakes} = \frac{48}{0.40} = 120 \]

Therefore, the total number of milkshakes sold that day is 120. 

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I will substitute the values of a, b, and c into the expression (c^2 − b^2)^2 + a^2.

1. Calculate c^2 and b^2:
   - c^2 = 2^2 = 4
   - b^2 = 3^2 = 9

2. Now, calculate (c^2 − b^2):
   - c^2 − b^2 = 4 − 9 = -5

3. Next, calculate (c^2 − b^2)^2:
   - (-5)^2 = 25

4. Now, calculate a^2:
   - a^2 = 5^2 = 25

5. Finally, add the two results together:
   - (c^2 − b^2)^2 + a^2 = 25 + 25 = 50

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to isolate the variable x in the equation x − 3 = 6. To do this, I will add 3 to both sides of the equation.

So, x − 3 + 3 = 6 + 3 simplifies to x = 9.

Now, I can check the value of x by substituting it back into the original equation: 9 − 3 = 6, which is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to determine the time Mike finished the race, which is given as 4:02 p.m. 

Next, since Joe finished the race 4 minutes before Mike, I will subtract 4 minutes from Mike's finishing time. 

4:02 p.m. minus 4 minutes is 3:58 p.m. 

Therefore, Joe finished the race at 3:58 p.m. The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"First, I need to convert the fractions to a common denominator to add them easily. The widths of the strips are 5/6 ft and 2/3 ft. The common denominator for 6 and 3 is 6.

Next, I convert 2/3 to sixths: 
2/3 = (2 * 2)/(3 * 2) = 4/6 ft.

Now, I can add the two widths together:
5/6 + 4/6 = (5 + 4)/6 = 9/6 ft.

Next, I simplify 9/6:
9/6 = 1 and 1/2 ft.

Now, I can compare this result with the provided options. The closest estimate for the combined width of the cardboard strips is 1 and 1/2 ft.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to calculate the area of one right triangle. The formula for the area of a right triangle is given by:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

For this triangle, the base is 4 cm and the height is 5 cm. So, the area of one triangle is:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 5 = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ cm}^2
\]

Next, since there are 12 right triangles of equal size, I need to multiply the area of one triangle by the number of triangles to find the total area:

\[
\text{Total Area} = 10 \text{ cm}^2 \times 12 = 120 \text{ cm}^2
\]

Therefore, the total area of the shape is 120 square centimeters. The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to identify the quantities of low-fat milk and chocolate milk. The order includes 40 gallons of low-fat milk and 15 gallons of chocolate milk.

Next, I will express the ratio of low-fat milk to chocolate milk. The ratio can be written as 40 (low-fat) to 15 (chocolate), which can be expressed as 40:15.

Now, I will simplify this ratio. To do this, I can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 40 and 15 is 5. 

Dividing both sides by 5 gives:
40 ÷ 5 = 8
15 ÷ 5 = 3

Thus, the simplified ratio of low-fat milk to chocolate milk is 8:3.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to understand the relationship between the number of students in Mr. Clark's class and the total number of students in the entire fourth grade. Mr. Clark's class has 20 students, and the problem states that there are 5 times as many students in the entire fourth grade as there are in Mr. Clark's class.

Next, I can express the total number of students in the entire fourth grade, n, in terms of the number of students in Mr. Clark's class. Since there are 5 times as many students in the entire fourth grade, I can write the equation as n = 5 * 20.

Now, I can simplify this equation to find the correct form. The equation can be rewritten as 20 * 5 = n, which matches option c.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"To restate the expression 4(3 + 2) using the Distributive Property, I will apply the property which states that a(b + c) = ab + ac.

First, I identify the components of the expression: here, a = 4, b = 3, and c = 2.

Next, I will distribute 4 to both 3 and 2. This means I will multiply 4 by 3 and 4 by 2.

So, applying the Distributive Property, I get: 4(3 + 2) = 4(3) + 4(2).

Now, I can compare this result with the provided choices.

The correct restatement using the Distributive Property is b) 4(3) + 4(2).

Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to determine how many pennies are in the original stack. Since 7 pennies have a height of 1 centimeter, the height of each penny is 1 cm / 7 = 1/7 cm per penny.

Next, I need to find out how many pennies are in Nick's stack, which has a height of 4 centimeters. To find the number of pennies, I can use the height of Nick's stack divided by the height of one penny: 

n = height of Nick's stack / height of one penny = 4 cm / (1/7 cm) = 4 * 7 = 28 pennies.

Now, I can see that the equation that represents this calculation is not directly listed in the options, but I can deduce that the correct approach involves multiplication, as I multiplied the height of Nick's stack by the number of pennies per centimeter.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I will round the numbers to make the multiplication easier. The number 4,286 can be rounded to 4,300, and 390 can be rounded to 400.

Next, I will multiply the rounded numbers: 
4,300 × 400 = 1,720,000.

Now, I will compare this estimate with the provided options to find the closest one. The closest estimate to 1,720,000 is 1,600,000.

Therefore, the best estimate for 4,286 × 390 is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I will substitute the given dimensions into the surface area formula S = 2(lw + wh + hl). The dimensions provided are length l = 12 inches, width w = 9 inches, and height h = 2 inches.

Next, I will calculate each of the products inside the parentheses:
1. lw = 12 * 9 = 108
2. wh = 9 * 2 = 18
3. hl = 2 * 12 = 24

Now, I will add these three results together:
lw + wh + hl = 108 + 18 + 24 = 150.

Finally, I will multiply this sum by 2 to find the surface area:
S = 2 * 150 = 300 square inches.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"To determine the most representative sample for the survey, I need to evaluate each option based on how well it captures the diversity of shoppers at the mall.

First, option (a) conducting the survey at one shoe store would likely only reflect the opinions of customers who shop specifically at that store, which may not represent the entire mall's customer base.

Next, option (b) conducting the survey at all shoe stores would provide a broader perspective than just one store, but it still focuses only on shoe shoppers and may miss out on other types of shoppers in the mall.

Then, option (c) conducting the survey at the entrance to the mall would likely capture a diverse range of shoppers as they enter, representing various stores and shopping preferences within the mall.

Finally, option (d) conducting the survey a mile away from the mall would likely yield responses from individuals who may not even shop at the mall, making it the least representative of the actual mall shoppers.

Considering these evaluations, the most representative sample would be option (c) conducting the survey at the entrance to the mall.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"First, I need to determine the elevation of Salt Flats, which is at -55 feet, and the elevation of Talon Bluff, which is at 620 feet. 

Next, I calculate the difference in elevation by subtracting the elevation of Salt Flats from the elevation of Talon Bluff: 

620 feet (Talon Bluff) - (-55 feet (Salt Flats)) = 620 + 55 = 675 feet.

Therefore, the difference in elevation between Talon Bluff and Salt Flats is 675 feet.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"First, I need to determine how many students were left after the first half went to the library. If there are 8 students remaining after half of the students went to the library, that means the number of students before going to the library was double that amount. 

So, if 8 students are left, then before going to the library, there were 8 * 2 = 16 students.

Next, I need to consider the second part of the problem where half of the remaining students (after the library) go to the computer lab. Since we already calculated that there were 16 students before any left, half of those students would go to the computer lab, which is 16 / 2 = 8 students.

After these 8 students go to the computer lab, the remaining students would be 16 - 8 = 8 students, which matches the information given in the problem.

Thus, the original number of students in the class is 16.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to identify the skip-counting rule in the given pattern: 5, 20, 35, 50, 65. 

To find the difference between consecutive numbers:
- 20 - 5 = 15
- 35 - 20 = 15
- 50 - 35 = 15
- 65 - 50 = 15

The pattern is skip-counting by 15.

Next, I will check each option to see if it follows the same skip-counting rule of adding 15:

a) 5, 20, 25, 30, 35...
- 20 - 5 = 15
- 25 - 20 = 5 (not 15)
This does not follow the rule.

b) 13, 18, 23, 28, 33...
- 18 - 13 = 5 (not 15)
This does not follow the rule.

c) 12, 27, 42, 57, 72...
- 27 - 12 = 15
- 42 - 27 = 15
- 57 - 42 = 15
- 72 - 57 = 15
This follows the rule.

d) 15, 30, 40, 55, 65...
- 30 - 15 = 15
- 40 - 30 = 10 (not 15)
This does not follow the rule.

After checking all options, the only sequence that follows the same skip-counting rule of adding 15 is option c.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

a) For 8 over 12, I can simplify it by dividing both by 4, which gives me 2 over 3. 

b) For 9 over 6, I can simplify it by dividing both by 3, which gives me 3 over 2. 

c) For 2 over 6, I can simplify it by dividing both by 2, which gives me 1 over 3. 

d) For 24 over 27, I can simplify it by dividing both by 3, which gives me 8 over 9. 

Now, I compare the simplified ratios:
- 2 over 3 (from 6 over 9) can form a proportion with 2 over 3 (from 8 over 12).
- 3 over 2 (from 9 over 6) does not match.
- 1 over 3 (from 2 over 6) does not match.
- 8 over 9 (from 24 over 27) does not match.

Thus, the only ratio that can form a proportion with 6 over 9 is 8 over 12.

"First, I need to convert the given rates into a common unit to compare them. The first rate is 18.5 dollars per m gallon, and the second rate is 3.60 dollars per 7.5 gallons. 

To find the equivalent rate for the second option, I will calculate the cost per gallon:
3.60 dollars / 7.5 gallons = 0.48 dollars per gallon.

Next, I need to convert the first rate into dollars per gallon. Since ""m gal"" is not defined, I will assume it is a typo and should be ""gallons."" Therefore, I will calculate:
18.5 dollars / 1 gallon = 18.5 dollars per gallon.

Now, I can compare the two rates:
- The first rate is 18.5 dollars per gallon.
- The second rate is 0.48 dollars per gallon.

Since 18.5 is much higher than 0.48, I will now check the options provided to see if any of them match the calculated rates or if they represent a different calculation.

Next, I will check the options to see if they represent a different calculation or if they are related to the rates provided. 

After reviewing the options, I realize that I need to find a value that could represent a ratio or a different calculation based on the rates provided. 

To find the ratio of the two rates:

Next, I will perform the division using these rounded numbers: 120 ÷ 6. 

Calculating this gives me 120 ÷ 6 = 20. 

Now, I can compare this estimate with the provided choices. The closest estimate to my calculation is about 20. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I need to understand the implications of Marguerite's scores. She has previously scored between 75 and 89 on all her tests, and now she has scored 100 on her next test. 

Next, I will analyze how this new score affects the mean. The mean is calculated by adding all the scores and dividing by the number of scores. Since 100 is higher than her previous maximum score of 89, adding this score will increase the total sum of the scores, and since the number of tests increases by one, the mean will also increase.

Now, I will consider the mode and median. The mode is the most frequently occurring score, and since Marguerite's previous scores were all between 75 and 89, the mode may or may not change depending on the frequency of those scores. The median, which is the middle score when arranged in order, will also likely increase because the new score of 100 is significantly higher than the previous scores.

Based on this analysis, the only statement that is definitively true is that the mean will increase.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"First, I will round the numbers to make the estimation easier. I can round 153 to 150 and 44 to 40.

"First, I need to add the two fractions: \( \frac{13}{14} + \frac{7}{14} \). Since they have the same denominator, I can simply add the numerators: 

\( 13 + 7 = 20 \). 

So, \( \frac{20}{14} \) is the result of the addition. 

Next, I can simplify \( \frac{20}{14} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2: 

\( \frac{20 \div 2}{14 \div 2} = \frac{10}{7} \). 

Now, I can convert \( \frac{10}{7} \) into a mixed number. Since 10 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 3, I can express this as \( 1 \frac{3}{7} \).

"First, I need to isolate the variable \( m \) in the equation \( \frac{5}{8} m = 6 \). To do this, I will multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{5}{8} \), which is \( \frac{8}{5} \).

So, I calculate:
\[
m = 6 \times \frac{8}{5}
\]

Next, I perform the multiplication:
\[
m = \frac{6 \times 8}{5} = \frac{48}{5}
\]

Now, I need to convert \( \frac{48}{5} \) into a mixed number. Dividing 48 by 5 gives 9 with a remainder of 3, so:
\[
\frac{48}{5} = 9 \frac{3}{5}
\]

Now, I can compare this result with the provided choices:
a) 3 and 5 over 9 
b) 3 and 3 over 4

"First, I will evaluate each pair of expressions to determine if they are equivalent.

a) For 7(2x), I calculate: 
   7(2x) = 14x. 
   The expression 9x is not equal to 14x, so they are not equivalent.

b) For 3x + 5x, I combine like terms: 
   3x + 5x = 8x. 
   The expression 15x is not equal to 8x, so they are not equivalent.

c) For 4(2x - 6), I distribute the 4: 
   4(2x) - 4(6) = 8x - 24. 
   The expression 8x - 24 is equal to 8x - 24, so they are equivalent.

d) For x + x + x + x, I combine like terms: 
   x + x + x + x = 4x. 
   The expression x^4 is not equal to 4x, so they are not equivalent.

After evaluating all pairs, the only equivalent expressions are in option c.

"First, I will calculate the changes in the stock price over the week. The initial price of the stock is $24.75.

1. On Monday, the stock gained $2.50:
   New price = $24.75 + $2.50 = $27.25

2. On Tuesday, the stock lost $3.25:
   New price = $27.25 - $3.25 = $24.00

3. On Wednesday, the stock lost $0.75:
   New price = $24.00 - $0.75 = $23.25

4. On Thursday, the stock gained $1.25:
   New price = $23.25 + $1.25 = $24.50

5. On Friday, the stock gained $4.75:
   New price = $24.50 + $4.75 = $29.25

Now, I have calculated the final price of the stock at the end of Friday to be $29.25.

"First, I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 96 and 216 to simplify the ratio. 

1. The prime factorization of 96 is: 
   - 96 = 2^5 * 3^1.
   
2. The prime factorization of 216 is: 
   - 216 = 2^3 * 3^3.

3. The GCD is found by taking the lowest power of each prime factor present in both factorizations:
   - For 2, the lowest power is 2^3.
   - For 3, the lowest power is 3^1.
   - Therefore, GCD = 2^3 * 3^1 = 8 * 3 = 24.

Now, I can simplify the ratio 96:216 by dividing both numbers by their GCD (24):

- 96 ÷ 24 = 4
- 216 ÷ 24 = 9

Thus, the simplified ratio of runners to swimmers is 4:9.

\]

where \( b_1 \) is the length of the shorter base, \( b_2 \) is the length of the longer base, and \( h \) is the height (the distance between the two bases).

1. First, I will identify the values:
   - \( b_1 = 130 \) yards (shorter base)
   - \( b_2 = 390 \) yards (longer base)
   - \( h = 75 \) yards (height)

2. Next, I will substitute these values into the area formula:

   \]

3. Now, I will calculate the sum of the bases:
   \[
   130 + 390 = 520
   \]

4. Then, I will calculate the area:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 520 \times 75 = 260 \times 75 = 19,500 \text{ yards}^2
   \]

Therefore, the area of the field is {'sol': 'b'}."
