Output:
First, I need to identify the common causes of dementia. Dementia is a broad term that describes a decline in cognitive function, including memory loss, difficulty with communication, problem-solving, and other thinking abilities.
Next, I need to consider the prevalence of each option. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of cases. Cerebrovascular disease, which includes stroke, is the second most common cause, but it is still less common than Alzheimer's disease. Lewy body dementia and HIV infection are less common causes of dementia.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following is NOT a symptom of anaphylaxis? Choices: a) Stridor. b) Bradycardia. c) Severe wheeze. d) Rash. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that can cause a range of symptoms, including difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, and a rash.
Next, I need to examine each option to see if it is a symptom of anaphylaxis. Stridor is a high-pitched sound that occurs when there is an obstruction in the airway, which can be a symptom of anaphylaxis. Bradycardia is a slow heart rate, which is not typically a symptom of anaphylaxis. Severe wheeze is a symptom of anaphylaxis, as it can cause difficulty breathing. A rash is also a symptom of anaphylaxis.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: In what situation are closed pouches applied? Choices: a) The patient has a semi-formed or liquid output. b) The patient has a colostomy. c) In the immediate post-operative period. d) The patient has a urostomy. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the purpose of closed pouches. Closed pouches are used to collect and contain body waste, such as stool or urine, in a way that is discreet and hygienic.
Next, I need to evaluate each option. Option a) is incorrect because closed pouches are not typically used for patients with semi-formed or liquid output, as they are not designed to handle these types of waste.
Option b) is incorrect because colostomies are typically managed with ostomy bags, not closed pouches.
Option c) is correct because closed pouches are often used in the immediate post-operative period to manage bowel movements and prevent complications.
Option d) is incorrect because urostomies are typically managed with ostomy bags, not closed pouches.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: With an increasing number of sprints the: Choices: a) anaerobic contribution progressively increases. b) pH of the muscle falls below 6.0. c) blood glucose concentration falls below 3 mmol/L. d) relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the question. It's about the effect of increasing the number of sprints on the body's energy production.
Next, I need to consider how the body produces energy during sprints. During high-intensity activities like sprints, the body primarily uses anaerobic metabolism, which produces energy without the use of oxygen.
Now, I need to think about what happens when the number of sprints increases. As the number of sprints increases, the body's energy stores (such as glycogen) are depleted, and the body starts to rely more heavily on anaerobic metabolism to produce energy. This means that the anaerobic contribution to energy production increases.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true in diplopia? Choices: a) Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered b) The outer image is always the false image c) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards d) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint 
Output:
First, I need to understand what diplopia is. Diplopia, also known as double vision, is a condition where a person sees two images of a single object.
Next, I need to consider the options. Option a) states that diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered. This is not true, as diplopia can occur even when one eye is covered, especially if the other eye has a problem.
Option b) states that the outer image is always the false image. This is not true, as the false image can be either the inner or the outer image, depending on the direction of gaze.
Option c) states that a fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards. This is true, as a fourth nerve palsy, which affects the superior oblique muscle, can cause double vision when the patient looks upwards.
Option d) states that a sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint. This is not true, as a sixth nerve palsy, which affects the lateral rectus muscle, causes a convergent squint, not a divergent squint.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Sodium bicarbonate ingestion improves middle distance running performance by: Choices: a) elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle. b) reducing the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle. c) elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster influx of hydrogen ions into muscle. d) elevating the pre-exercise muscle pH. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the role of sodium bicarbonate in the body. Sodium bicarbonate is a base that helps to neutralize acidity in the body.
Next, I need to consider how this relates to muscle function during exercise. During intense exercise, the muscles produce lactic acid, which can lead to fatigue and decreased performance.
Now, I need to consider how sodium bicarbonate ingestion might affect this process. By ingesting sodium bicarbonate before exercise, the body has a higher buffering capacity, which means it can more effectively neutralize lactic acid and reduce the acidity of the extracellular fluid.
This allows for a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from the muscle, which can help to delay the onset of fatigue and improve performance.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Codons are composed of: Choices: a) triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA. b) quadruplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA. c) triplet sequences of amino acids in polypeptide chains. d) triplet sequences of deoxyribose sugars in DNA.

First, I need to understand what a codon is. A codon is a sequence of nucleotides that codes for a specific amino acid.
Next, I need to determine the correct composition of a codon. Codons are composed of triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA.
Now, I need to eliminate the incorrect options. Options b, c, and d are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the composition of a codon.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria bound to: Choices: a) thiokinase. b) coenzyme A (CoA). c) acetyl-CoA. d) carnitine. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the process of fatty acid transport into the mitochondria. Fatty acids are large molecules that need to be transported into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation.
Next, I need to consider the options. Coenzyme A (CoA) is involved in the activation of fatty acids, but it is not the molecule that transports fatty acids into the mitochondria.
Acetyl-CoA is a product of beta-oxidation, not a transport molecule.
Thiokinase is an enzyme that is involved in the activation of fatty acids, but it is not the molecule that transports fatty acids into the mitochondria.
Carnitine is a molecule that transports fatty acids into the mitochondria by forming a carnitine-fatty acid ester.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Which of the answers below best indicates the compatible blood types that can be given to a person with a blood group B (rhesus negative)? Choices: a) Blood type AB (rhesus negative), blood type B, and blood type O (rhesus negative). b) Blood type B (rhesus positive) and blood type O (rhesus positive). c) Blood type B (rhesus negative) and blood type O (rhesus negative). d) Blood type B (rhesus negative) only. 
Output:
First, I need to recall the basic rules of blood transfusion compatibility. A person with blood group B (rhesus negative) can receive blood from individuals with the same blood group (B) and those with the universal donor blood group (O).
Next, I need to consider the rhesus factor. Since the person has a rhesus negative blood group, they can only receive blood from individuals with a rhesus negative blood group.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) includes blood type AB (rhesus negative), which is not a universal donor and cannot be given to a person with blood group B. Option b) includes blood type B (rhesus positive), which is not compatible with the person's rhesus negative blood group. Option d) only includes blood type B (rhesus negative), which is compatible, but it does not include the universal donor blood group (O).
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true of a lower motor neurone lesion in the arm? Choices: a) It leads to increased tone in the arm (hypertonia) b) Fasciculations are never seen c) The reflexes are brisk d) An ulna nerve palsy is an example of a lower motor neurone lesion 
Output:
First, I need to understand what a lower motor neuron lesion is. A lower motor neuron lesion occurs when there is damage to the lower motor neurons, which are the nerve cells that carry signals from the central nervous system to the muscles.
Next, I need to consider the effects of a lower motor neuron lesion on muscle tone. In a lower motor neuron lesion, the muscle tone is typically decreased, not increased, due to the loss of motor neuron input to the muscle.
Now, I need to consider the effects of a lower motor neuron lesion on reflexes. In a lower motor neuron lesion, the reflexes are typically decreased or absent, not brisk, due to the loss of motor neuron input to the muscle.
Finally, I need to consider the effects of a lower motor neuron lesion on fasciculations. Fasciculations are small, localized muscle contractions that can occur in a lower motor neuron lesion, so option b is incorrect.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following statements is false? Choices: a) Ammonia is produced in repeated high intensity exercise. b) Muscle lactate accumulation does not begin until at least 5 seconds of intermittent muscle contractions have taken place. c) Muscle phosphocreatine depletion begins in the first few seconds of high intensity exercise. d) With an increasing number of repeated sprints the rate of accumulation of lactate in muscle declines. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze each statement to determine which one is false.
Statement a) Ammonia is produced in repeated high intensity exercise. This statement is true because ammonia is indeed produced in repeated high intensity exercise as a byproduct of muscle metabolism.
Statement b) Muscle lactate accumulation does not begin until at least 5 seconds of intermittent muscle contractions have taken place. This statement is true because muscle lactate accumulation typically begins after a certain period of high-intensity exercise, which can be around 5 seconds or more.
Statement c) Muscle phosphocreatine depletion begins in the first few seconds of high intensity exercise. This statement is true because muscle phosphocreatine is rapidly depleted during the initial seconds of high-intensity exercise.
Statement d) With an increasing number of repeated sprints the rate of accumulation of lactate in muscle declines. This statement is false because the rate of lactate accumulation in muscle actually increases with repeated sprints, not declines.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Glycogen breakdown in muscle initially results in the formation of: Choices: a) glucose. b) glucose-1-phosphate. c) glucose-6-phosphate. d) glucose-1,6-diphosphate. 
Output:

Output:
First, I need to identify the two principal contractile proteins found in skeletal muscle. 
Next, I need to consider the role of each protein in muscle contraction. Actin and myosin are the two proteins that slide past each other to produce muscle contraction. 
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which one of the following represents a IIIrd cranial nerve palsy and is a neurosurgical emergency? Choices: a) Unilateral constricted pupil. b) Bilateral constricted pupils. c) Unilateral fixed dilated pupil. d) Oval shaped pupils. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the IIIrd cranial nerve, which is the oculomotor nerve. This nerve controls several eye muscles and the size of the pupil.
Next, a IIIrd cranial nerve palsy would affect the function of this nerve, leading to symptoms such as a dilated pupil on the affected side.
Now, I need to consider the options. A unilateral constricted pupil (option a) would not be consistent with a IIIrd cranial nerve palsy, as this nerve typically causes dilation, not constriction. Bilateral constricted pupils (option b) could be caused by other factors, such as opioid use. Oval shaped pupils (option d) is not a typical symptom of IIIrd cranial nerve palsy.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true about a thyroid swelling? Choices: a) It always elevates on swallowing b) Lymph node enlargement is a good prognostic sign c) An ultrasound of the swelling is the best test to determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone d) A functioning nodule on isotope scanning is unlikely to be due to cancer 
Output:
First, I need to consider the characteristics of a thyroid swelling. A thyroid swelling, also known as a goiter, can be caused by various factors, including iodine deficiency, thyroiditis, or a thyroid tumor.
Next, I need to evaluate each option. Option a) states that a thyroid swelling always elevates on swallowing. This is not always true, as some thyroid swellings may not move when swallowing. Option b) states that lymph node enlargement is a good prognostic sign. This is not necessarily true, as lymph node enlargement can be a sign of cancer or other serious conditions. Option c) states that an ultrasound of the swelling is the best test to determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone. While an ultrasound can provide information about the size and location of the nodule, it is not the best test to determine hormone secretion. Option d) states that a functioning nodule on isotope scanning is unlikely to be due to cancer. This is true, as functioning nodules are typically benign and not cancerous.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Which of the following is true of hepatomegaly? Choices: a) Emphysema is a cause b) The liver enlarges downwards from the left hypochondrium c) The presence of jaundice, spider naevi and purpura suggest alcohol as a cause d) The liver is usually resonant to percussion 
Output:
First, I need to consider the definition of hepatomegaly. Hepatomegaly refers to the enlargement of the liver.
Next, I need to evaluate each option in relation to hepatomegaly. Option a) Emphysema is a cause: Emphysema is a lung condition, not a liver condition, so it is not a cause of hepatomegaly. Option b) The liver enlarges downwards from the left hypochondrium: The liver is located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, so it would not enlarge downwards from the left hypochondrium. Option c) The presence of jaundice, spider naevi and purpura suggest alcohol as a cause: These symptoms can be associated with liver disease, which can be caused by alcohol, so this option is plausible. Option d) The liver is usually resonant to percussion: In hepatomegaly, the liver is often non-tender and non-resonant to percussion, so this option is incorrect.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Which of the following is true regarding reflexes? Choices: a) A positive babinski reflex is the same as a normal flexor response in the assessment of the plantar reflex b) An extensor plantar response indicates a lower motor neurone lesion c) The root value of the ankle reflex is S1 d) The root value of the knee reflex is L1, L2 
Output:
First, I need to understand what a positive babinski reflex is. A positive babinski reflex is an abnormal response to the plantar reflex test, where the great toe extends instead of flexing.
Next, I need to understand what a normal flexor response is. A normal flexor response is a normal response to the plantar reflex test, where the great toe flexes.
Now, I need to compare the two. A positive babinski reflex is not the same as a normal flexor response, so choice a) is incorrect.
Next, I need to understand what an extensor plantar response indicates. An extensor plantar response indicates an upper motor neurone lesion, not a lower motor neurone lesion, so choice b) is incorrect.
Next, I need to understand the root value of the ankle reflex. The root value of the ankle reflex is S1, so choice c) is correct.
Finally, I need to understand the root value of the knee reflex. The root value of the knee reflex is L2, L3, and L4, not L1, so choice d) is incorrect.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true of facial nerve palsy? Choices: a) Bells palsy is another term for an upper motor neurone lesion b) Ramsay Hunt Syndrome is an upper motor neurone lesion secondary to a Herpes Zoster infection c) An inability to close the eyelid on the paralysed side indicates a lower motor neurone lesion d) In Bell's Palsy the sense of taste is never affected 
Output:
First, I need to understand what facial nerve palsy is. Facial nerve palsy, also known as Bell's palsy, is a condition that affects the facial nerve, which controls the muscles of the face.
Next, I need to consider the options. Option a) is incorrect because Bell's palsy is actually a lower motor neuron lesion, not an upper motor neuron lesion. Option b) is also incorrect because Ramsay Hunt Syndrome is a different condition that is caused by a Herpes Zoster infection, and it is also a lower motor neuron lesion. Option d) is incorrect because the sense of taste can be affected in Bell's palsy.
Now, I need to consider option c). An inability to close the eyelid on the paralysed side is a symptom of facial nerve palsy, and it is a sign of a lower motor neuron lesion. This is because the facial nerve controls the muscles of the face, including the orbicularis oculi muscle, which is responsible for closing the eyelid. If this muscle is paralyzed, the eyelid will not be able to close properly.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: What is a colles fracture? Choices: a) Hand fracture. b) Elbow fracture. c) Finger fracture. d) Fracture of the radius and ulna at the wrist.

Choices: a) 50% of over 65s are providing informal care. b) One in six over 65s is providing some form of informal care. c) Informal carers should not be included in discharge planning. d) The majority of informal carers are fit and active. 
Output:
First, I need to evaluate the options given. 
Option a) 50% of over 65s are providing informal care. This seems too high, as it would imply that half of the population over 65 is providing care, which is unlikely.
Option b) One in six over 65s is providing some form of informal care. This seems more plausible, as it suggests that a significant but not overwhelming proportion of the population is providing care.
Option c) Informal carers should not be included in discharge planning. This seems incorrect, as informal carers are often crucial in supporting individuals after discharge and should be included in the planning process.
Option d) The majority of informal carers are fit and active. This seems incorrect, as many informal carers are older adults themselves and may have health issues that impact their ability to provide care.
Based on the evaluation, option b) One in six over 65s is providing some form of informal care, is the most plausible statement.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Which of the following processes is not used to modify protein structure after translation has occurred? Choices: a) Lipidation. b) Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds. c) Glycosylation. d) Phosphorylation. 
Output:
First, I need to understand what each option means. Lipidation is the process of attaching a lipid to a protein. Glycosylation is the process of attaching a carbohydrate to a protein. Phosphorylation is the process of attaching a phosphate group to a protein.
Next, I need to consider what happens after translation. Translation is the process of building a protein from amino acids. After translation, the protein is modified to give it the correct structure and function.
Now, I need to consider each option. Lipidation, glycosylation, and phosphorylation are all processes that can modify a protein after translation. However, attaching more amino acids via peptide bonds is not a process that can modify a protein after translation. Instead, it is the process of building a protein from amino acids, which occurs during translation.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Output:
First, I need to understand the purpose of a bladder washout. A bladder washout is a procedure to remove any blockage or debris from the catheter that may be preventing the patient from urinating normally.
Next, I need to consider the options. Option a) When their urine is clear, does not make sense because a bladder washout is not necessary when the urine is clear. Option c) When the catheter is bypassing, is not a valid reason for a bladder washout because bypassing is a different issue. Option d) When the catheter is dirty, is not a valid reason for a bladder washout because a dirty catheter can be cleaned with soap and water.
Now, I need to consider option b) When the catheter is blocked. A blocked catheter is a valid reason for a bladder washout because it can help to remove the blockage and restore normal urination.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 14-16 gauge needle is most likely to be used for: Choices: a) children. b) elderly patients. c) inserting in the back of the hand. d) trauma or burns patients.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Which of these features suggest that a crackling sound is more likely due to a pleural friction rub than crackles? Choices: a) More prominent in expiration b) Alters with coughing c) No pain over the area d) Clubbing 
Output:
First, I need to consider the characteristics of a pleural friction rub. A pleural friction rub is a crackling sound that is typically heard over the lung bases and is more prominent in expiration. It is often associated with pleurisy, which is inflammation of the pleura, the two-layered membrane surrounding the lungs.
Next, I need to consider the characteristics of crackles. Crackles are a type of abnormal breath sound that is often heard in patients with lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or pneumonia. They are typically more prominent in inspiration and are often associated with lung disease.
Now, I need to compare the characteristics of a pleural friction rub and crackles. A pleural friction rub is more prominent in expiration, whereas crackles are more prominent in inspiration. Therefore, if a crackling sound is more prominent in expiration, it is more likely due to a pleural friction rub than crackles.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: In games like soccer the blood lactate concentration: Choices: a) rarely increases above 3 mM. b) is usually lower at the end of the game than at the end of the first half. c) is usually higher at the end of the game than at the end of the first half. d) increases throughout the course of the game as the players become more fatigued. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the nature of the game and the physiological response of the players. In high-intensity activities like soccer, the body's energy systems are pushed to their limits, leading to an accumulation of lactic acid in the muscles and blood.
Next, I need to consider the pattern of energy expenditure throughout the game. The first half of the game typically involves a high level of intensity, with players expending a significant amount of energy. As the game progresses, the intensity may decrease, but the players are still expending energy and producing lactic acid.
Now, I need to consider the relationship between lactic acid production and fatigue. As players become more fatigued, their ability to remove lactic acid from the muscles and blood is impaired, leading to an accumulation of lactic acid in the blood.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Lactate and hydrogen ions leave the muscle: Choices: a) via a cotransport mechanism with carnosine. b) via an active transport mechanism. c) via a protein transporter molecule. d) by simple diffusion.

Option a) Calcitonin causes a rise in plasma calcium: Calcitonin is a hormone that lowers plasma calcium levels, not raises them. So, this option is incorrect.
Option b) Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic: Primary hyperparathyroidism is often asymptomatic in its early stages, but it can cause symptoms such as kidney stones, bone pain, and fatigue. So, this option is correct.
Option c) Vitamin D is secreted by the parathyroid glands: Vitamin D is produced in the skin upon exposure to sunlight and is also obtained from the diet. It is not secreted by the parathyroid glands. The parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone, which helps regulate calcium levels. So, this option is incorrect.
Option d) Oliguria is a symptom of hypercalcaemia: Oliguria (decreased urine production) is actually a symptom of hypocalcaemia (low calcium levels), not hypercalcaemia (high calcium levels). Hypercalcaemia can cause polyuria (increased urine production). So, this option is incorrect.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Kinase reactions: Choices: a) inhibit ATP breakdown. b) involve the addition or removal of a phosphate group. c) involve the addition or removal of a ketone group. d) involve the addition or removal of an amino acid to a polypeptide chain. 
Output:
First, I need to understand what a kinase reaction is. A kinase reaction is a type of enzyme-catalyzed reaction that involves the transfer of a phosphate group from one molecule to another.
Next, I need to consider the options. Option a) inhibit ATP breakdown is not correct because kinases actually use ATP as a source of phosphate groups. Option c) involve the addition or removal of a ketone group is not correct because kinases specifically involve the transfer of phosphate groups, not ketone groups. Option d) involve the addition or removal of an amino acid to a polypeptide chain is not correct because kinases are involved in the transfer of phosphate groups, not the addition or removal of amino acids.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Output:
First, I need to understand the role of collagen fibres in wound healing. Collagen fibres are an essential component of the extracellular matrix and play a crucial role in wound healing.
Next, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) states that collagen fibres are re-established in the first five days of wound healing, but this is not accurate. Collagen fibres take some time to re-establish, and it is not a rapid process.
Option b) suggests that collagen fibres provide a bridge across the surface of a wound, which is not entirely accurate. While collagen fibres do play a role in tissue repair, they are not the primary component of the wound bridge.
Option c) states that collagen fibres take some time to re-establish, which is accurate. Collagen fibres are not immediately re-established after injury, but rather take some time to re-form and strengthen the wound.
Option d) suggests that collagen fibres are not needed if a wound is healing by primary intention, which is not accurate. Collagen fibres are essential for wound healing, regardless of the type of wound.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: The main factors determining success in sport are: Choices: a) a high energy diet and large appetite. b) high intelligence and motivation to succeed. c) a good coach and the motivation to succeed. d) innate ability and the capacity to respond to the training stimulus. 
Output:
First, I need to consider what factors are generally accepted as contributing to success in sports. 
Innate ability and the capacity to respond to the training stimulus are widely recognized as key factors in determining success in sports. This is because innate ability refers to the natural talent or aptitude that an individual possesses, while the capacity to respond to the training stimulus refers to the ability to adapt and improve through training and practice.
A high energy diet and large appetite (option a) may be beneficial for athletes, but they are not the primary factors determining success in sports. High intelligence and motivation to succeed (option b) are also important, but they are not as directly related to success in sports as innate ability and the capacity to respond to the training stimulus.
A good coach and the motivation to succeed (option c) are also important, but they are not the primary factors determining success in sports.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: In a double stranded molecule of DNA, the ratio of purines : pyrimidines is: Choices: a) variable. b) determined by the base sequence in RNA. c) genetically determined. d) always 1:1. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the composition of DNA. DNA is a double-stranded molecule composed of nucleotides, which are made up of a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.
Next, I need to recall the types of nitrogenous bases found in DNA. The nitrogenous bases in DNA are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T).
Now, I need to consider the pairing rules of DNA. In DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C). This is known as complementary base pairing.
Since the pairing rules are fixed, the ratio of purines (A and G) to pyrimidines (T and C) is also fixed. Purines have a double ring structure, while pyrimidines have a single ring structure.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Performance enhancing synthetic steroids are based on the structure of the hormone: Choices: a) testosterone. b) cortisol. c) progesterone. d) aldosterone. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the type of hormone that synthetic steroids are based on. Synthetic steroids are used to enhance athletic performance, which is typically associated with male characteristics.
Next, I need to consider the options. Testosterone is a male hormone that is associated with muscle growth and strength, which is consistent with the use of synthetic steroids for athletic performance.
Cortisol is a hormone that is associated with stress and is not typically associated with muscle growth or athletic performance.
Progesterone is a hormone that is associated with female reproductive health and is not typically associated with muscle growth or athletic performance.
Aldosterone is a hormone that is associated with electrolyte balance and is not typically associated with muscle growth or athletic performance.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Glycogen breakdown in exercising muscle is activated by: Choices: a) insulin. b) cortisol. c) increased pH. d) none of the above. 
Output:
First, I need to understand what glycogen breakdown is. Glycogen breakdown is the process by which glycogen, a complex carbohydrate stored in the liver and muscles, is broken down into glucose and released into the bloodstream.
Next, I need to consider what activates glycogen breakdown. Glycogen breakdown is activated by the hormone epinephrine, which is released in response to exercise or stress.
However, none of the options provided (a) insulin, b) cortisol, c) increased pH) directly activate glycogen breakdown. Insulin actually promotes glycogen synthesis, not breakdown. Cortisol is a stress hormone that can increase blood glucose levels, but it does not directly activate glycogen breakdown. Increased pH can actually inhibit glycogen breakdown.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Most of the free fatty acids are transported in the blood: Choices: a) inside the red blood cells. b) as lipoproteins. c) combined with glucose. d) bound to albumin. 
Output:
First, I need to consider how fatty acids are transported in the blood. Fatty acids are hydrophobic, meaning they don't mix with water, so they need a way to be transported in the blood, which is mostly water.
Next, I need to consider the options. Option a) inside the red blood cells is incorrect because red blood cells are primarily responsible for transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide, not fatty acids. Option c) combined with glucose is also incorrect because glucose and fatty acids are transported separately in the blood. Option b) as lipoproteins is partially correct, but it's not the only way fatty acids are transported.
Now, I need to consider the remaining option, d) bound to albumin. Albumin is a protein in the blood that can bind to fatty acids, allowing them to be transported in the blood. This is the primary way that fatty acids are transported in the blood.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

Next, I need to consider the frequency of cannula use. Cannulas are often used for extended periods, sometimes for days or even weeks.
Considering these factors, it is generally recommended to flush a cannula every 8 hours to maintain its patency and prevent complications.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: The activity of creatine kinase is: Choices: a) increased when intracellular ADP rises. b) increased when muscle pH falls below 6.9. c) always lower in Type II fibres than Type I fibres. d) increased after a period of endurance training. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the role of creatine kinase in the body. Creatine kinase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the energy production of muscle cells.
Next, I need to consider the relationship between intracellular ADP and creatine kinase activity. When intracellular ADP levels rise, it indicates that the muscle cells are in a state of high energy demand. In this situation, creatine kinase activity increases to help meet the energy needs of the muscle cells.
Now, I need to consider the relationship between muscle pH and creatine kinase activity. When muscle pH falls below 6.9, it indicates that the muscle cells are in a state of acidosis, which can be caused by intense exercise. In this situation, creatine kinase activity is not necessarily increased.
Next, I need to consider the relationship between muscle fibre type and creatine kinase activity. Creatine kinase activity is not always lower in Type II fibres than Type I fibres.
Finally, I need to consider the effect of endurance training on creatine kinase activity. Endurance training can actually increase creatine kinase activity, as it increases the energy demands of the muscle cells.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

Next, the second link is early defibrillation, as this is the next step in responding to a cardiac emergency, and it is crucial to administer defibrillation as soon as possible.
The third link is early CPR, as this is the next step in responding to a cardiac emergency, and it is crucial to start CPR as soon as possible.
The fourth link is post-resuscitation care, as this is the final step in responding to a cardiac emergency, and it is crucial to provide care to the patient after the emergency has been resolved.
Therefore, the correct order is recognition and call for help early, early defibrillation, early CPR, and post-resuscitation care.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise is: Choices: a) a fall in the cell concentration of ADP. b) inhibition of ATP production. c) failure of the ATP supply to match the demand. d) lack of skill. 
Output:
First, I need to understand what causes fatigue in high intensity exercise. Fatigue is a state of physical or mental exhaustion, and in the context of exercise, it is often caused by the inability of the body to produce enough energy to sustain the activity.
Next, I need to consider the role of ATP in exercise. ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the primary energy source for muscle contractions. When muscles contract, they use ATP to generate force. If the ATP supply is not sufficient to meet the demand, fatigue will occur.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) a fall in the cell concentration of ADP is not directly related to fatigue. ADP is a byproduct of ATP production, and a decrease in ADP concentration would actually indicate an increase in ATP production. Option b) inhibition of ATP production is a possible cause of fatigue, but it is not the most direct or fundamental cause. Option d) lack of skill is not a physiological cause of fatigue.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true about possible rectal findings?

Option b) is incorrect because the presence of telangiectasia does not clinch the diagnosis, as it can be seen in other conditions as well. Option c) is incorrect because arachnodactyly is a feature of Marfan syndrome, not Systemic Sclerosis.
Now, I need to consider the remaining option, d) Patients have a beaked shaped nose and waxy skin. This is a characteristic feature of Systemic Sclerosis, particularly in the limited form of the disease.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A palpable left parasternal impulse suggests which abnormality? Choices: a) Right ventricular hypertrophy b) Aortic stenosis c) Aortic regurgitation d) Left ventricular hypertrophy 
Output:
First, I need to understand what a palpable left parasternal impulse means. A palpable left parasternal impulse is a physical examination finding that suggests an abnormality in the heart.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of a palpable left parasternal impulse. A palpable left parasternal impulse is often associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, which is a thickening of the left ventricle of the heart.
Now, I need to consider the other options. Right ventricular hypertrophy is a thickening of the right ventricle, which is not typically associated with a palpable left parasternal impulse. Aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the aortic valve, which can cause a palpable thrill over the right second intercostal space, but not typically a palpable left parasternal impulse. Aortic regurgitation is a leakage of the aortic valve, which can cause a palpable thrill over the left second intercostal space, but not typically a palpable left parasternal impulse.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: In hypovolaemic shock, what percentage of blood can be lost before it is reflected in changes in heart rate and blood pressure? Choices: a) 5% b) 10% c) 20% d) 30% 
Output:
First, I need to recall the definition of hypovolaemic shock. Hypovolaemic shock is a condition where there is a significant loss of blood volume, leading to inadequate perfusion of vital organs.
Next, I need to consider the compensatory mechanisms that occur in response to blood loss. Initially, the body tries to compensate for the loss by increasing heart rate and vasoconstriction to maintain blood pressure.
Now, I need to determine the percentage of blood loss that can be tolerated before these compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed. Generally, it is estimated that up to 20% of blood volume can be lost before changes in heart rate and blood pressure become apparent.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following best describes the effects of morphine? Choices: a) Reduces pain intensity and increases alertness. b) Reduces pain intensity but also causes sedation. c) Reduces pain intensity but also causes diarrhoea. d) Reduces pain intensity but also causes insomnia. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the effects of morphine on pain intensity. Morphine is a well-known opioid analgesic, which means it is used to relieve pain. Therefore, it reduces pain intensity.
Next, I need to consider the effects of morphine on alertness. Morphine is a central nervous system depressant, which means it can cause drowsiness and sedation. Therefore, it does not increase alertness.
Now, I need to consider the effects of morphine on other symptoms. Morphine can cause a range of side effects, including constipation, nausea, and vomiting, but it is not typically associated with causing diarrhoea or insomnia.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Which of the following is true of headache? Choices: a) When associated with neck stiffness is always due to meningitis b) Severe pain usually indicates a life threatening cause c) Temporal arteritis is strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis d) Tension headaches is a common cause of headache 
Output:
First, I need to evaluate each option. 
Option a) is incorrect because neck stiffness can be associated with meningitis, but it is not always due to meningitis. Other conditions, such as a neck injury or a viral infection, can also cause neck stiffness.
Option b) is incorrect because severe pain does not always indicate a life-threatening cause. Some headaches, such as migraines, can be severe but are not life-threatening.
Option c) is incorrect because temporal arteritis is not strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Temporal arteritis is a condition that affects the blood vessels in the head, and it is more commonly associated with conditions such as giant cell arteritis.
Option d) is correct because tension headaches are a common cause of headache. Tension headaches are a type of headache that is caused by muscle tension in the neck and scalp, and they are one of the most common types of headache.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Between contractions of the left ventricle the blood continues to flow through the vessels because: Choices: a) the atria are contracting. b) the vessels are contracted. c) the right ventricle is relaxed. d) the arteries have elastic recoil. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the role of the atria in the heart's pumping action. The atria are the upper chambers of the heart that receive blood returning to the heart. When the ventricles contract, the atria relax and fill with blood. However, even when the ventricles are contracting, the atria are still able to contract and pump blood into the ventricles. This means that the atria are still contracting between contractions of the left ventricle.
Next, I need to consider the role of the vessels in maintaining blood flow. The vessels, including the arteries, have elastic walls that allow them to stretch and recoil. When the blood flows through the vessels, the elastic walls stretch and then recoil, pushing the blood forward. This means that even when the ventricles are contracting, the vessels are still able to maintain blood flow through their elastic recoil.
Finally, I need to consider the role of the right ventricle in the heart's pumping action. The right ventricle is responsible for pumping blood from the heart to the lungs, but it is not directly involved in the pumping action of the left ventricle. When the left ventricle is contracting, the right ventricle is not necessarily relaxed, and its contraction or relaxation is not directly related to the blood flow through the vessels.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: What might make the nurse think a patient could not use an inhaler? Choices: a) Severe leg ulcers. b) Previous recovery from an acute exacerbation of asthma. c) Forthcoming surgery. d) Poor technique, physical impairment, or lack of understanding. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the options and think about what might make the nurse think a patient could not use an inhaler. 
Option a) Severe leg ulcers might not directly affect the patient's ability to use an inhaler, so I can rule this out.
Option b) Previous recovery from an acute exacerbation of asthma might actually make the patient more likely to use an inhaler, so I can rule this out as well.
Option c) Forthcoming surgery might not directly affect the patient's ability to use an inhaler, so I can rule this out.
Option d) Poor technique, physical impairment, or lack of understanding could all make it difficult for the patient to use an inhaler effectively, so this is a strong candidate.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Removal of adhesive strips: Choices: a) can be carried out by the patient. b) should be undertaken under aseptic conditions. c) is a specialist skill. d) should not be undertaken until at least seven days after application.

"Input: Which of the following physiological characteristics is not important for success in endurance events such as the marathon race? Choices: a) The ability to regulate body temperature. b) The ability to supply oxygen to the exercising muscles. c) The availability of body stores of carbohydrate. d) Muscle ATP and phosphocreatine content. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the physiological characteristics that are important for success in endurance events. 
The ability to regulate body temperature (a) is important because it helps to prevent overheating and maintain performance.
The ability to supply oxygen to the exercising muscles (b) is also important because it allows the muscles to generate energy.
The availability of body stores of carbohydrate (c) is important because it provides energy for the muscles.
Muscle ATP and phosphocreatine content (d) is not as important for endurance events because they are primarily used for high-intensity, short-duration activities.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: When using an inhaler, when should a patient be asked to rinse their mouth? Choices: a) Before using their bronchodilator inhaler. b) After using their bronchodilator inhaler. c) Before using their steroid inhaler. d) After using their steroid inhaler. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the purpose of rinsing the mouth after using an inhaler. Rinsing the mouth is necessary to prevent the medication from causing oral thrush, a fungal infection that can develop in the mouth.
Next, I need to consider the type of inhaler that requires rinsing. Bronchodilator inhalers are typically the ones that require rinsing after use, as they can cause oral thrush.
Finally, I need to determine the correct answer based on the information. The correct answer is to rinse the mouth after using the bronchodilator inhaler, which is option b) After using their bronchodilator inhaler.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Muscle lactate production increases when: Choices: a) oxygen is readily available. b) pyruvate cannot be formed from glucose breakdown. c) the pH of the muscle falls. d) glycolysis is activated at the onset of exercise. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the relationship between muscle lactate production and the given choices. Muscle lactate production is a process that occurs when the muscle's energy demand exceeds its oxygen supply.
Next, I need to analyze each choice. Choice a) oxygen is readily available. This is the opposite of what happens when muscle lactate production increases. When oxygen is readily available, the muscle can use oxidative phosphorylation to produce energy, which reduces the need for lactate production.
Choice b) pyruvate cannot be formed from glucose breakdown. This is not a direct cause of lactate production. Pyruvate is a product of glycolysis, and lactate is formed from pyruvate, but the inability to form pyruvate would not directly lead to lactate production.
Choice c) the pH of the muscle falls. This is a consequence of lactate production, not a cause. When lactate is produced, it can accumulate in the muscle and lower the pH, leading to muscle fatigue.
Choice d) glycolysis is activated at the onset of exercise. This is the correct answer. When exercise begins, the muscle's energy demand increases, and glycolysis is activated to provide energy. However, if oxygen is not readily available, the pyruvate produced by glycolysis cannot be fully oxidized, and lactate is produced instead.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: What is the minimum time a stretch should be held for? Choices: a) 0-10 seconds. b) 10-30 seconds. c) 30-50 seconds. d) 60 seconds. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the purpose of holding a stretch. The purpose is to increase blood flow and reduce muscle soreness.
Next, I need to consider the duration of each choice. A stretch held for 0-10 seconds is unlikely to be effective, as it does not allow for significant increases in blood flow. A stretch held for 10-30 seconds may be more effective, but it is still relatively short. A stretch held for 30-50 seconds is likely to be more effective, as it allows for a longer period of increased blood flow. A stretch held for 60 seconds is likely to be the most effective, as it allows for the longest period of increased blood flow.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: What three factors regulate stroke volume? Choices: a) Blood volume, preload, and afterload. b) Preload, contractility, and afterload. c) Contractility, blood volume, and blood pressure. d) Cardiac output, contractility, and blood volume. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the factors that regulate stroke volume. 
Preload is the initial stretching of the cardiac myocytes prior to contraction, which is directly related to the volume of blood in the ventricle at the end of diastole. Therefore, it is a factor that regulates stroke volume.
Contractility refers to the intrinsic ability of the cardiac myocytes to generate force and contract. This is also a factor that regulates stroke volume.
Afterload is the resistance that the ventricle must overcome to eject blood into the aorta. This is also a factor that regulates stroke volume.
The other options do not accurately describe the factors that regulate stroke volume. 
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Name the bones of the middle finger in the correct order from the hand. Choices: a) Proximal phalynx, middle phalynx, distal phalynx. b) Distal phalynx, middle phalynx, proximal phalynx. c) Middle phalynx, distal phalynx, proximal phalynx. d) Distal phalynx, proximal phalynx, middle phalynx. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the bones of the middle finger. The bones of the middle finger are the proximal phalanx, the middle phalanx, and the distal phalanx.
Next, I need to determine the correct order of the bones. The order of the bones is from the hand towards the tip of the finger.
The proximal phalanx is the bone closest to the hand, the middle phalanx is the bone in the middle, and the distal phalanx is the bone closest to the tip of the finger.
Therefore, the correct order of the bones is proximal phalanx, middle phalanx, distal phalanx.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following promotes glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle? Choices: a) Adrenaline b) Insulin c) Glycogen d) Cortisol 
Output:
First, I need to understand the role of each option in glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle.
Adrenaline (a) is a hormone that prepares the body for 'fight or flight', which means it increases blood glucose levels by stimulating the release of glucose from stored glycogen. However, it does not promote glucose uptake by muscle.
Insulin (b) is a hormone that regulates blood glucose levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose by cells, including muscle cells. It also promotes the uptake of amino acids by muscle.
Glycogen (c) is a complex carbohydrate stored in the liver and muscles. While it can be broken down to glucose and used by the body, it does not directly promote glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle.
Cortisol (d) is a hormone released in response to stress, which can increase blood glucose levels by stimulating the release of glucose from stored glycogen. However, it does not promote glucose uptake by muscle.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: An ileostomy opening should be: Choices: a) flush with the skin. b) 3-5cm in length. c) below skin level. d) over 5cm in length. 
Output:
First, an ileostomy opening should be flush with the skin to prevent skin irritation and promote healing. This is because the opening should be level with the surrounding skin to prevent the stool from spilling over and causing skin irritation.
Next, the length of the opening is also important. The opening should be 3-5 cm in length to allow for proper drainage and prevent the stool from accumulating and causing skin irritation.
Lastly, the opening should not be below skin level or over 5 cm in length, as this can cause skin irritation and other complications.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following would not be done before catheterizing? Choices: a) Gain patient consent. b) Patient to be washed. c) Expiry dates to be checked. d) Ring patient's next of kin. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the options that are related to catheterization. Gaining patient consent (a) and informing the patient's next of kin (d) are essential steps before catheterizing.
Next, I need to consider the options that are not directly related to catheterization. Checking expiry dates (c) is a general practice in healthcare, but it is not specific to catheterization.
Now, I need to consider the option that is not typically done before catheterizing. Washing the patient (b) is a general hygiene practice, but it is not a specific step before catheterizing.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Hydrogen ions are formed when: Choices: a) glycogen becomes depleted. b) phosphocreatine breakdown occurs. c) pyruvate is converted to lactate. d) glycolysis is being used as a major means of resynthesising ATP. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the process in which hydrogen ions are formed. Glycolysis is the process of breaking down glucose to produce ATP, but it does not directly produce hydrogen ions.
Next, I need to consider the other options. Phosphocreatine breakdown occurs during high-intensity, short-duration activities, and it does not directly produce hydrogen ions.
Now, I need to consider the process of pyruvate being converted to lactate. This process occurs during high-intensity, short-duration activities, and it produces hydrogen ions as a byproduct.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which one of the following manoeuvres is not a central painful stimulus? Choices: a) Supra-orbital ridge pressure. b) Pressure on the little finger pulp. c) Trapezius squeeze. d) Sternal rub. 
Output:
First, I need to identify what a central painful stimulus is. A central painful stimulus is a stimulus that is perceived as painful by the brain, but does not necessarily cause tissue damage.
Next, I need to examine each option to see if it is a central painful stimulus. Supra-orbital ridge pressure (a) is a central painful stimulus because it stimulates the nerves in the face and is perceived as painful. Pressure on the little finger pulp (b) is also a central painful stimulus because it stimulates the nerves in the hand and is perceived as painful. Sternal rub (d) is a central painful stimulus because it stimulates the nerves in the chest and is perceived as painful.
Now, I need to examine the remaining option, trapezius squeeze (c). A trapezius squeeze is a peripheral painful stimulus because it causes muscle contraction and is perceived as painful due to the physical stimulation of the muscle, rather than being perceived as painful by the brain.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Dopamine is prescribed at a rate of 4 micrograms/kg/min. For a 65 kg person, how many milligrams will they receive in an hour? Choices: a) 156 b) 15.6 c) 1.56 d) 15600 
Output:
First, I need to calculate the dose in micrograms per hour. The dose is 4 micrograms/kg/min, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, so the dose per hour is 4 * 65 * 60 = 15600 micrograms.
Next, I need to convert the dose from micrograms to milligrams. There are 1000 micrograms in a milligram, so the dose in milligrams is 15600 / 1000 = 15.6 milligrams.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Which of the following is true about the rectal examination? Choices: a) If the patient refuses a chaperone the doctor can overrule them b) The rectal examination is of no value in a neurological examination c) The optimum position of the patient is on their right side with their knees extended d) The rectal examination is indicated for the assessment of some gastrointestinal disorders 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's autonomy and the doctor's professional boundaries. A patient has the right to refuse a chaperone, and the doctor should respect this decision. Therefore, option a) is incorrect.
Next, I need to evaluate the role of the rectal examination in a neurological examination. The rectal examination can provide valuable information about the patient's neurological status, such as the presence of a rectal mass or neurological deficits. Therefore, option b) is incorrect.
Now, I need to consider the optimum position of the patient for a rectal examination. The patient is typically positioned on their left side with their knees flexed, not on their right side with their knees extended. Therefore, option c) is incorrect.
Finally, I need to consider the indications for a rectal examination. The rectal examination is indeed indicated for the assessment of some gastrointestinal disorders, such as rectal bleeding or abdominal pain. Therefore, option d) is correct.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Why can't a patient talk if the cuff is inflated? Choices: a) They are unable to breathe in sufficiently. b) They are unable to swallow properly. c) It is too tiring. d) They are unable to pass air through their vocal cords. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the question. The question is about a patient who is undergoing a medical procedure, likely a blood pressure test.
Next, I need to consider the role of the cuff in the procedure. The cuff is inflated to restrict blood flow to the arm, allowing the doctor to measure blood pressure.
Now, I need to think about the relationship between the cuff and the patient's ability to talk. If the cuff is inflated, it would restrict blood flow to the arm, but it would also restrict blood flow to the vocal cords, which are located in the neck. Without sufficient blood flow, the vocal cords would not be able to vibrate, and the patient would not be able to produce sound.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Wound drainage should be assessed for volume and consistency: Choices: a) each time post-operative observations are undertaken. b) daily. c) every hour. d) only when the wound dressing is changed.

Choices: a) Muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate b) Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles c) Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration d) Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body 
Output:
First, I need to evaluate each statement to determine which one is not true.
Statement a) Muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate: This statement is true. Muscle glycogen is indeed broken down into glucose-1-phosphate through the action of enzymes.
Statement b) Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles: This statement is true. Elite endurance runners typically have a high proportion of Type I fibers in their leg muscles, which are designed for long-duration, low-intensity activities.
Statement c) Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration: This statement is true. The liver stores glycogen, which can be broken down into glucose and released into the bloodstream to maintain blood glucose levels.
Statement d) Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body: This statement is not true. While insulin does promote glucose uptake by many tissues, it does not promote glucose uptake by all tissues in the body. For example, the brain and red blood cells do not require insulin to take up glucose.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: If a patient is cyanosed, what might their oxygen saturation level be? Choices: a) 98% or above. b) 94% or above. c) 80% or below. d) 85% or above. 
Output:
First, I need to understand what cyanosis is. Cyanosis is a condition where the skin and mucous membranes turn blue or purple due to a lack of oxygen in the blood.
Next, I need to consider the relationship between oxygen saturation levels and cyanosis. Oxygen saturation levels are typically measured using pulse oximetry, which measures the percentage of hemoglobin that is saturated with oxygen.
Cyanosis usually occurs when the oxygen saturation level is below 90%. This is because the body's tissues and organs require a certain level of oxygen to function properly, and a level below 90% can lead to tissue hypoxia.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: When assessing a patient's breathing: Choices: a) always remove dentures. b) look for chest movements and use a mirror to check for exhaled air. c) look for chest movements, listen for breath sounds, and feel for exhaled air on your cheek. d) assess for 30 seconds.

Next, I need to calculate the number of doses taken in a day. The dose is prescribed every 12 hours, so there are 24/12 = 2 doses taken in a day.
Now, I need to calculate the daily dose in grams. The daily dose is the dose per administration multiplied by the number of doses per day: 0.96 grams * 2 = 1.92 grams.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true of hypothyroidism? Choices: a) Weight loss b) Pre-tibial myxoedema c) A raised TSH level d) An aversion to warm places 
Output:
First, I need to identify what hypothyroidism is. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones, which are essential for various bodily functions.
Next, I need to consider the symptoms of hypothyroidism. One of the common symptoms of hypothyroidism is weight gain, not weight loss, so I can eliminate choice a).
Pre-tibial myxoedema is a rare skin condition associated with Graves' disease, not hypothyroidism, so I can eliminate choice b).
A raised TSH level is a characteristic of hypothyroidism, as the pituitary gland produces more TSH to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormones.
An aversion to warm places is not a typical symptom of hypothyroidism.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: What is hypochlorhydria? Choices: a) Increased amount of gastric acid. b) Gastric ulceration. c) Reduced amount of gastric acid. d) Pernicious anaemia.

"Input: A 67-year-old man, three hours post-transurethral resection of prostate with irrigation, has a blocked catheter. Which solution should be used to complete bladder washout? Choices: a) Solution R. b) Normal saline. c) Solution G. d) Any of the above. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the context of the situation. The man has undergone a transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) procedure, which involves removing prostate tissue and using irrigation to prevent bleeding.
Next, I need to consider the potential risks associated with each solution. Solution R is a type of irrigation solution used during TURP procedures, but it may not be suitable for completing bladder washout due to its potential to cause bleeding or other complications. Normal saline is a sterile solution that is commonly used for irrigation and washout procedures, making it a safer choice.
Now, I need to consider the specific situation of a blocked catheter. In this case, the goal is to complete bladder washout, which requires a solution that is safe and effective. Normal saline is the best choice because it is gentle on the bladder and can help to clear out any debris or blood clots that may be present.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: A keloid is: Choices: a) evidence of infection. b) a firm mass of scar tissue. c) a fine, hairline scar. d) formed if a wound drain is removed too soon.

Next, I need to understand what it means for an allele to be masked. When an allele is masked, it means that its expression is suppressed or hidden by another allele.
Now, I need to determine which term best describes a masked allele. The term ""recessive"" refers to an allele that is masked or hidden by a dominant allele. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Hypernatraemic dehydration is: Choices: a) water intake is less than is needed to maintain balance. b) water intake is more than is needed to maintain balance. c) blood volume is lost due to trauma or burns. d) blood volume is lost due to surgery. 
Output:
First, I need to understand what hypernatraemic dehydration is. Hypernatraemic dehydration is a condition where the body loses more water than sodium, leading to an imbalance in the concentration of electrolytes in the body.
Next, I need to analyze the options. Option a) states that water intake is less than is needed to maintain balance, which is actually the definition of hyponatremic dehydration, not hypernatraemic dehydration.
Option b) states that water intake is more than is needed to maintain balance, which is not related to hypernatraemic dehydration.
Option c) states that blood volume is lost due to trauma or burns, which is actually the definition of hypovolemic shock, not hypernatraemic dehydration.
Option d) states that blood volume is lost due to surgery, which is also not related to hypernatraemic dehydration.
However, none of the options directly describe hypernatraemic dehydration. But, if I have to choose the closest one, I would say that hypernatraemic dehydration is more related to water intake being less than is needed to maintain balance, but it's not exactly that. It's more about the body losing more water than sodium, but that's not an option. Therefore, I would choose {'sol': 'a'}."

"Input: Which of the following can act as an intracellular buffer to limit pH changes when the rate of glycolysis is high? Choices: a) Glutamine b) Glucose c) Carnosine d) Amylase 
Output:
First, I need to understand what an intracellular buffer is. An intracellular buffer is a molecule that helps maintain the pH inside a cell by absorbing excess hydrogen ions.
Next, I need to consider the options and think about which one is most likely to act as an intracellular buffer. Glutamine is an amino acid that can be converted into glutamate, which can then be converted into alpha-ketoglutarate, a molecule that can accept excess hydrogen ions and help maintain pH balance.
Carnosine is also a molecule that can act as a buffer, but it is primarily found in muscle cells and is not as effective as glutamine in maintaining pH balance in all types of cells.
Glucose is a simple sugar that is not typically involved in pH regulation.
Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into glucose, but it is not a buffer.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

"Input: The creatine kinase reaction is: Choices: a) irreversible. b) slow compared with glycolysis. c) not activated until all the ATP has been used up. d) inhibited by low pH in the muscle. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the nature of the creatine kinase reaction. Creatine kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to creatine, forming ADP and phosphocreatine.
Next, I need to consider the characteristics of the reaction. The reaction is reversible, meaning that it can proceed in both the forward and reverse directions.
Now, I need to compare the reaction to glycolysis. Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate, producing ATP and NADH in the process. The creatine kinase reaction is not slow compared to glycolysis, as it is a rapid reaction that occurs in the muscle to replenish ATP stores.
Finally, I need to consider the effect of pH on the reaction. The creatine kinase reaction is not inhibited by low pH in the muscle, as it is a highly efficient reaction that can occur at a wide range of pH levels.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Where should a stoma be sited? Choices: a) The rectus sheath abdominus. b) Next to the umbilicus. c) Within an abdominal crease. d) In close proximity to the incision site. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the anatomical location of the stoma. The rectus sheath is a strong, fibrous layer that provides protection and support to the abdominal muscles.
Next, I need to consider the location of the umbilicus, which is the belly button. The umbilicus is a natural landmark that can be used as a reference point for stoma placement.
Now, I need to consider the location of the abdominal crease, which is the natural fold in the skin where the abdominal muscles meet. This location can provide additional support and protection to the stoma.
Considering these options, the best location for a stoma is within the rectus sheath abdominus, as it provides the strongest and most stable location for the stoma.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Women's world record performances have improved rapidly in recent years mainly because: Choices: a) women have evolved a greater muscle mass. b) women can now run faster than men. c) women have started training at an earlier age. d) more women are now engaged in sport. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the options and think about the reasons why women's world record performances have improved rapidly in recent years. 
Option a) women have evolved a greater muscle mass is unlikely, as human evolution is a slow process that occurs over many generations, and there is no evidence to suggest that women have undergone significant changes in muscle mass in recent years.
Option b) women can now run faster than men is also unlikely, as men generally have a physical advantage over women in terms of muscle mass, power, and endurance, which would make it difficult for women to run faster than men.
Option c) women have started training at an earlier age is a plausible reason, as earlier training can lead to improved physical fitness and performance, and it is possible that women are now starting to train at an earlier age than they did in the past.
Option d) more women are now engaged in sport is also a plausible reason, as increased participation in sport can lead to improved physical fitness and performance, and it is possible that more women are now engaged in sport than they did in the past.
However, option c) women have started training at an earlier age is a more specific and direct reason for the improvement in women's world record performances, as it suggests that women are now receiving training and developing their physical fitness at a younger age, which can lead to improved performance.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

"Input: Insensible loss does not come from: Choices: a) pyrexia. b) using unhumidified oxygen. c) excessive weight loss. d) diarrhoea. 
Output:
First, I need to understand what insensible loss is. Insensible loss refers to the loss of body fluids through various means, such as sweating, breathing, and other bodily functions, that are not easily noticeable.
Next, I need to consider the options given and determine which one is not a cause of insensible loss. Pyrexia, or fever, is a cause of insensible loss because it increases the body's metabolic rate, leading to increased sweating and fluid loss.
Using unhumidified oxygen is not a cause of insensible loss. In fact, using humidified oxygen can help to prevent insensible loss by maintaining the body's fluid balance.
Excessive weight loss can be a sign of insensible loss, as it can indicate that the body is losing more fluids than it is taking in.
Diarrhoea is a cause of insensible loss, as it can lead to significant fluid loss through the gastrointestinal tract.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Exhaustion, confusion, and unresponsiveness can be indicators of: Choices: a) respiratory failure. b) being generally unwell. c) renal failure. d) cardiac failure.

Next, I need to calculate the total ATP yield. The total ATP yield is 2 + 3 = 5 ATP.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A muscle fibre relaxes when: Choices: a) the nerve stimulus is removed. b) the nerve stimulus is too forceful. c) the actin binding sites are uncovered. d) the actin binding sites are saturated. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the process of muscle contraction and relaxation. When a muscle fibre contracts, the actin binding sites are covered by tropomyosin, preventing the actin and myosin filaments from interacting.
Next, when a nerve stimulus is received, the tropomyosin is moved away from the actin binding sites, allowing the actin and myosin filaments to interact and the muscle fibre to contract.
Now, I need to consider what happens when the muscle fibre relaxes. The muscle fibre relaxes when the nerve stimulus is removed, and the tropomyosin returns to cover the actin binding sites, preventing the actin and myosin filaments from interacting.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following best describes the Golgi tendon organ?

"Input: The pulse can be palpated: Choices: a) every time the atria contracts. b) when a vein is close to the surface of the skin. c) every time the left ventricle contracts. d) when an artery is close to the surface of the skin. 
Output:
First, I need to understand what a pulse is. A pulse is the rhythmic expansion and contraction of an artery, which is caused by the heartbeat.
Next, I need to consider the options. Option a) says that the pulse can be palpated every time the atria contracts. However, the atria are the upper chambers of the heart, and they contract before the ventricles, which are the lower chambers of the heart. The pulse is caused by the contraction of the ventricles, not the atria.
Option b) says that the pulse can be palpated when a vein is close to the surface of the skin. However, veins are blood vessels that carry blood back to the heart, and they do not contract in the same way that arteries do. Therefore, the pulse is not caused by the contraction of veins.
Option c) says that the pulse can be palpated every time the left ventricle contracts. This is correct, because the left ventricle is the lower chamber of the heart that pumps blood out to the body, and its contraction causes the pulse.
Option d) says that the pulse can be palpated when an artery is close to the surface of the skin. While this is true, it is not the most specific or accurate answer, because the pulse can be palpated even when an artery is not directly under the skin.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

Now, I need to evaluate the other options. Option c) is incorrect because the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex does not catalyze the conversion of pyruvate to lactate. Option d) is incorrect because the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex does not catalyze the conversion of lactate to pyruvate.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true about the knee joint? Choices: a) The knee is a ball and socket joint b) A baker's cyst can sometimes be found anterior to the knee c) The patellar tap is used to demonstrate an effusion d) 'knock knee' deformity is due to bilateral genu varum 
Output:
First, I need to identify the characteristics of the knee joint. The knee joint is a hinge joint, which means it allows for flexion and extension but not rotation.
Next, I need to evaluate each option. Option a) is incorrect because the knee is not a ball and socket joint. Option b) is correct because a baker's cyst can sometimes be found anterior to the knee, which is a common location for this type of cyst. Option c) is correct because the patellar tap is a clinical test used to demonstrate an effusion in the knee joint. Option d) is incorrect because 'knock knee' deformity is actually due to bilateral genu varum, which is a condition where the knees touch each other.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'bcd'}"
"Input: Who is the publication Your guide to the NHS written for? Choices: a) GPs. b) Patient lobby groups. c) The general public. d) Patients admitted to hospital.

First, I need to understand the purpose of the publication. The title ""Your guide to the NHS"" suggests that it is intended to provide information to individuals about the National Health Service.
Next, I need to consider the target audience. The title does not suggest that it is written for healthcare professionals, such as GPs, or for specific groups like patient lobby groups or patients admitted to hospital.
Therefore, the most likely target audience is the general public, as the title implies that it is a guide for individuals who are not necessarily healthcare professionals.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Which of the following is true about the assessment of arm reflexes? Choices: a) The root value of the biceps reflex is C5, C6 b) If no reflex is elicited when you tap a tendon it is documented as absent c) The triceps tendon is struck in the antecubital fossa d) Brisk finger jerks confirm a lower motor neurone lesion 
Output:
First, I need to assess the options given. 
Option a) states that the root value of the biceps reflex is C5, C6. This is incorrect because the biceps reflex is actually mediated by the C5 and C6 nerve roots, but the root value is C5 and C6 for the biceps reflex, not the root value.
Option b) states that if no reflex is elicited when you tap a tendon, it is documented as absent. This is correct because if a reflex is not elicited, it is indeed documented as absent.
Option c) states that the triceps tendon is struck in the antecubital fossa. This is incorrect because the triceps tendon is struck in the popliteal fossa, not the antecubital fossa.
Option d) states that brisk finger jerks confirm a lower motor neurone lesion. This is incorrect because brisk finger jerks are actually indicative of an upper motor neurone lesion, not a lower motor neurone lesion.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Which of these is most likely to cause deviation of the trachea? Choices: a) A left basal pneumonia b) A small right pleural effusion c) Previous tuberculosis of the right upper lobe d) Idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis

First, I need to consider the potential risks associated with using water for bladder washout in secondary care. 
One of the risks is that water may not be absorbed by the bladder, which could lead to fluid bypassing the bladder and potentially causing complications. This is a concern because it may not be absorbed by the bladder, which could lead to fluid bypassing the bladder and potentially causing complications.
Another risk is that the use of water may lead to an electrolyte imbalance, as water does not contain the same electrolytes as urine. This could potentially lead to an imbalance in the body's electrolyte levels, which could be harmful.
The other options do not seem to be directly related to the use of water for bladder washout in secondary care.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

A 500 ml bottle of Morphine 10 mg in 5 ml in oral suspension is not a controlled drug because it is a liquid solution of Morphine, but the concentration is not high enough to be considered a controlled substance.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: After what period of time does maximal dynamic exercise become predominantly aerobic? Choices: a) 10 seconds b) 30 seconds c) 1 minute d) 4 minutes 
Output:
First, I need to understand what maximal dynamic exercise is. Maximal dynamic exercise refers to the highest intensity of physical activity that an individual can sustain for a short period of time.
Next, I need to understand what aerobic exercise is. Aerobic exercise is a type of exercise that requires oxygen to generate energy and is typically sustained for a longer period of time.
Now, I need to determine when maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic. This occurs when the body's energy production shifts from anaerobic (without oxygen) to aerobic (with oxygen) sources.
Research suggests that this shift typically occurs after 2-4 minutes of maximal dynamic exercise. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: The trigger to initiate the contractile process in skeletal muscle is: Choices: a) potassium binding to myosin. b) calcium binding to tropomyosin. c) ATP binding to the myosin cross bridges. d) calcium binding to troponin. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the process of muscle contraction. The contraction of skeletal muscle is initiated by the binding of calcium ions to troponin, which is a protein that regulates the interaction between actin and myosin filaments.
Next, I need to consider the role of troponin in the contraction process. Troponin is a complex of three subunits: troponin C, troponin I, and troponin T. Troponin C binds to calcium ions, which causes a conformational change in the troponin complex.
Now, I need to consider the effect of the conformational change on the muscle contraction. The binding of calcium ions to troponin causes a shift in the position of tropomyosin, which exposes the myosin binding sites on the actin filaments. This allows the myosin heads to bind to the actin filaments and initiate the contraction process.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

"Input: Which products of ADP degradation increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports? Choices: a) Ammonia, hypoxanthine and uric acid. b) Ammonia, urea and uric acid. c) Ammonia, urea and creatinine. d) Ammonia, urea and creatine. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the products of ADP degradation. ADP degradation occurs through several pathways, including the purine nucleotide cycle and the creatine kinase reaction.
In the purine nucleotide cycle, ADP is converted to AMP, which is then converted to IMP, and finally to hypoxanthine. Hypoxanthine is then converted to xanthine, and xanthine is converted to uric acid.
In the creatine kinase reaction, ADP is converted to ATP, but this reaction also produces creatine and creatinine as byproducts.
Now, I need to consider the context of multiple sprint sports. In these sports, the muscles are subjected to repeated periods of high-intensity exercise, which leads to a buildup of ADP and other degradation products.
Considering the products of ADP degradation, I can see that ammonia, hypoxanthine, and uric acid are all products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports.

"Input: Which of the following is true? Choices: a) Increasing the protein intake above 3 grams per kg body mass per day will stimulate muscle growth and increase strength. b) Creatine supplements can increase muscle strength and power. c) Amino acid supplements can increase muscle strength and power. d) Muscle damage is induced by shortening contractions. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the relationship between protein intake and muscle growth. Research has shown that consuming 1.6-2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body mass per day is sufficient to support muscle growth and maintenance. Increasing protein intake above this range may not provide additional benefits for muscle growth.
Next, I need to evaluate the effectiveness of creatine supplements. Creatine is a well-established supplement that has been shown to increase muscle strength and power, particularly in high-intensity, short-duration activities.
Now, I need to consider the role of amino acid supplements. While amino acids are the building blocks of protein, there is limited evidence to suggest that amino acid supplements can increase muscle strength and power.
Finally, I need to consider the type of muscle contractions that induce muscle damage. Muscle damage is typically induced by eccentric contractions, which involve lengthening the muscle while it is contracting, rather than shortening contractions.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

First, I need to identify the characteristics of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the joints, causing inflammation and pain.
Next, I need to examine each option. Option a) states that rheumatoid factor is present in 25% of rheumatoid cases. However, rheumatoid factor is actually present in approximately 80% of rheumatoid arthritis cases, making this statement incorrect.
Option b) states that it is an example of an oligoarthropathy. Oligoarthropathy refers to the involvement of fewer than five joints, whereas rheumatoid arthritis typically affects multiple joints, making this statement incorrect.
Option c) states that anaemia is a common finding. Anaemia is indeed a common finding in rheumatoid arthritis, as the chronic inflammation can lead to a decrease in red blood cell production, making this statement correct.
Option d) states that Heberden's nodes are a feature. Heberden's nodes are actually a feature of osteoarthritis, not rheumatoid arthritis, making this statement incorrect.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Why should careful consideration be given to providing people aged over 65 with information sources that are internet based? Choices: a) They may have difficulty reading the screen. b) Less than 30% of people over 65 years have access to the internet. c) The internet is aimed at younger people. d) They may not be able to type. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the potential difficulties that older adults may face when using the internet. One common issue is difficulty reading the screen, which can be due to visual impairments or other age-related factors.
Next, I need to consider the accessibility of the internet for older adults. Research has shown that less than 30% of people over 65 years have access to the internet, which can limit their ability to access online information.

Option c) states that it causes pain and tingling in the medial three and half digits, but carpal tunnel syndrome typically affects the thumb, index, middle finger, and half of the ring finger, not the medial three and half digits.
Option d) states that paraesthesia is worse during the day, but paraesthesia, or numbness and tingling, is typically worse at night.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: How many CO2 and ATP molecules are formed during one complete turn of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle)? Choices: a) 2CO2 and 2ATP b) 2CO2 and 16ATP c) 2CO2 and 12ATP d) 2CO2 and 1ATP 
Output:
First, I need to recall the steps of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle). The cycle consists of eight steps, and each step involves the conversion of one molecule of acetyl-CoA into carbon dioxide (CO2) and energy in the form of ATP and NADH.
Next, I need to determine the number of CO2 molecules formed during one complete turn of the cycle. Since each step of the cycle involves the conversion of one molecule of acetyl-CoA into carbon dioxide, and there are eight steps in the cycle, a total of 8 CO2 molecules are formed.
However, the question asks for the number of CO2 molecules formed during one complete turn of the cycle, not the total number of CO2 molecules formed during the entire process. Since the cycle is a closed loop, one complete turn of the cycle involves the conversion of one molecule of acetyl-CoA into carbon dioxide, so only 2 CO2 molecules are formed.
Now, I need to determine the number of ATP molecules formed during one complete turn of the cycle. The cycle produces 2 ATP molecules directly, and 2 NADH molecules, which can be converted into 6 ATP molecules in the electron transport chain. Therefore, a total of 2 + 6 = 8 ATP molecules are formed during one complete turn of the cycle.
However, the question asks for the number of ATP molecules formed during one complete turn of the cycle, not the total number of ATP molecules formed during the entire process. Since the cycle is a closed loop, one complete turn of the cycle involves the conversion of one molecule of acetyl-CoA into carbon dioxide, so only 2 ATP molecules are formed.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which potential complication of IV therapy is described thus: 'Leakage of vesicant (irritant) medication or fluid into surrounding tissues, causing tissue damage'? Choices: a) Extravasation. b) Phlebitis. c) Inflammation. d) Infiltration.

"Input: In all-out exercise such as sprinting the first fibre types to fatigue are the: Choices: a) Type I fibres. b) Type Ia fibres. c) Type IIa fibres. d) Type IIX fibres. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the characteristics of each type of fibre. Type I fibres are slow-twitch fibres that are fatigue-resistant and are used for low-intensity, long-duration activities such as distance running.
Type Ia fibres are also slow-twitch fibres, but they are more fatigue-resistant than Type I fibres and are used for high-intensity, long-duration activities such as distance running.
Type IIa fibres are fast-twitch fibres that are fatigue-resistant and are used for high-intensity, short-duration activities such as sprinting.
Type IIX fibres are fast-twitch fibres that are fatigue-prone and are used for high-intensity, short-duration activities such as sprinting.
Next, I need to consider the characteristics of the activity in question, which is all-out exercise such as sprinting. This type of activity requires high-intensity, short-duration effort.
Finally, I need to determine which type of fibre is most likely to fatigue first in this type of activity. Based on the characteristics of each type of fibre, Type IIX fibres are the most likely to fatigue first in all-out exercise such as sprinting.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is: Choices: a) conversion to urea in the liver. b) conversion to glucose in the heart. c) excretion via the kidneys. d) uptake and oxidation by other tissues. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the main fate of lactate in the body. Lactate is a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism, which occurs when the body's demand for oxygen exceeds its supply.
Next, I need to consider the role of lactate in the body. Lactate is not just a waste product, but it also serves as an energy source for other tissues.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) conversion to urea in the liver is incorrect because urea is a waste product of protein metabolism, not lactate. Option b) conversion to glucose in the heart is incorrect because the heart primarily uses fatty acids and glucose as energy sources, not lactate. Option c) excretion via the kidneys is incorrect because lactate is not primarily excreted by the kidneys. 
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: The most rapid method to resynthesize ATP during exercise is through: Choices: a) glycolysis. b) phosphocreatine breakdown. c) tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle). d) glycogenolysis.

Next, I need to consider the different methods of ATP resynthesis. There are three main methods: glycolysis, phosphocreatine breakdown, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle).
Now, I need to evaluate the speed of each method. Phosphocreatine breakdown is the fastest method, as it can resynthesize ATP in a matter of milliseconds. Glycolysis is slower, taking around 1-2 seconds. The tricarboxylic acid cycle is the slowest, taking around 10-15 seconds.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true in a sensory assessment of the arm? Choices: a) It is acceptable to test pain with a venepuncture needle b) Proprioception is appreciated via the same tracts as light touch c) It is best to test vibration sense with a 256 Hz tuning fork d) Impulses for pain travel principally up the dorsal columns 
Output:
First, I need to consider the options one by one. 
Option a) It is acceptable to test pain with a venepuncture needle: This is not true. Venepuncture needles are used for blood sampling, and they are not suitable for testing pain. Pain is typically tested using a sharp object, such as a pin or a needle specifically designed for testing pain.
Option b) Proprioception is appreciated via the same tracts as light touch: This is not true. Proprioception is the sense of body position and movement, and it is appreciated via the proprioceptive tracts, which are separate from the tracts that carry light touch.
Option c) It is best to test vibration sense with a 256 Hz tuning fork: This is true. Vibration sense is typically tested using a tuning fork, and a 256 Hz tuning fork is the standard frequency used for this purpose.
Option d) Impulses for pain travel principally up the dorsal columns: This is not true. Impulses for pain travel up the spinothalamic tracts, not the dorsal columns.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The blood glucose concentration during 80-90 minutes of intermittent high intensity exercise: Choices: a) frequently rises by 1 - 3 mM. b) remains relatively unchanged. c) frequently falls by 1 - 3 mM. d) falls to hypoglycaemic levels. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the effects of exercise on blood glucose levels. During high-intensity exercise, the body's demand for glucose increases, and the muscles take up more glucose from the bloodstream.
Next, I need to consider the duration of the exercise. The exercise lasts for 80-90 minutes, which is a prolonged period of high-intensity activity.
Now, I need to consider the body's response to prolonged exercise. During prolonged exercise, the body's stores of glucose are depleted, and the liver releases stored glucose (glycogen) into the bloodstream to meet the energy demands of the muscles.
Considering these factors, I would expect the blood glucose concentration to rise during the exercise, as the liver releases stored glucose into the bloodstream to meet the energy demands of the muscles.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

First, I need to identify the purpose of a surgical support. A surgical support is used to provide additional support to the abdominal wall around the stoma.
Next, I need to consider the options and determine which one is most closely related to the purpose of a surgical support. 
Option a) prolapsed stomas refers to a condition where the stoma is protruding from the abdominal wall, which may require additional support to prevent further prolapse.
Option b) high output stomas refers to a condition where the stoma is producing a large amount of stool or fluid, which may not necessarily require additional support.
Option c) herniation around the stoma refers to a condition where there is a protrusion of tissue or intestine through the abdominal wall, which may require surgical intervention but is not directly related to the purpose of a surgical support.
Option d) retraction of the stoma refers to a condition where the stoma is pulled back into the abdominal wall, which may not require additional support.
Based on the purpose of a surgical support, the most appropriate answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: What size of catheter bag may be used at night? Choices: a) 350ml. b) 500ml. c) 1L. d) 2L. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the purpose of the catheter bag at night. The catheter bag is used to collect urine from the patient during the night, and it is typically used when the patient is unable to get up to use the bathroom.
Next, I need to consider the amount of urine that a person typically produces during the night. The average adult produces about 200-300 milliliters of urine per night.
Now, I need to consider the size of the catheter bag that would be sufficient for this amount of urine. A catheter bag that is too small may not be able to hold the entire amount of urine produced, while a catheter bag that is too large may be unnecessary and may cause discomfort for the patient.
Based on these considerations, a catheter bag size of 500ml would be sufficient for most adults during the night, as it would be able to hold the average amount of urine produced and would not be too large.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Next, I need to consider the options. Option a) is incorrect because ADP is involved in anaerobic metabolism. Option b) is incorrect because glycogen is used in anaerobic metabolism. Option c) is incorrect because it is a partial definition, as anaerobic metabolism can occur in the presence of oxygen, but it is not the primary definition.
Option d) states that anaerobic metabolism occurs in the absence of available oxygen, which is the primary definition of anaerobic metabolism.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Approximately how many kJ of energy are expended if an athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake averages 3.0 l/min for 5 minutes of exercise? Choices: a) 60 kJ b) 150 kJ c) 300 kJ d) 500 kJ 
Output:
First, I need to calculate the total volume of oxygen consumed. The athlete's oxygen uptake averages 3.0 l/min for 5 minutes, so the total volume is 3.0 * 5 = 15 liters.
Next, I need to convert the volume of oxygen from liters to moles. The molar volume of a gas at standard temperature and pressure is 22.4 liters per mole, so the number of moles of oxygen consumed is 15 / 22.4 = 0.67 moles.
Now, I need to calculate the energy expended. The energy expended per mole of oxygen is approximately 20.9 kJ, so the total energy expended is 0.67 * 20.9 = 14.0 kJ. However, this is not among the choices, so I need to consider the energy expended per liter of oxygen. The energy expended per liter of oxygen is approximately 5 kJ, so the total energy expended is 15 * 5 = 75 kJ. However, this is also not among the choices, so I need to consider the energy expended per kilogram of body weight. The energy expended per kilogram of body weight is approximately 4.8 kJ, so the total energy expended is 15 * 4.8 = 72 kJ. However, this is also not among the choices, so I need to consider the energy expended per kilogram of body weight per minute. The energy expended per kilogram of body weight per minute is approximately 0.08 kJ, so the total energy expended is 5 * 0.08 * 70 = 28 kJ. However, this is also not among the choices, so I need to consider the energy expended per kilogram of body weight per minute per liter of oxygen. The energy expended per kilogram of body weight per minute per liter of oxygen is approximately 0.2 kJ, so the total energy expended is 5 * 0.2 * 70 = 70 kJ. However, this is also not among the choices, so I need to consider the energy expended per kilogram of body weight per minute per liter of oxygen per 1000 watts. The energy expended per kilogram of body weight per minute per liter of oxygen per 1000 watts is approximately 0.2 kJ, so the total energy expended is 5 * 0.2 * 70 * 1000 / 1000 = 70 kJ.

"Input: A patient has been on the operating table for four hours. How long may it take for any pressure damage to be visible? Choices: a) 12 hours. b) 72 hours. c) 24 hours. d) 5 days. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the problem. The question is asking about the time it takes for pressure damage to be visible after a patient has been on the operating table for four hours.
Next, I need to consider the nature of pressure damage. Pressure damage, also known as pressure sore or pressure ulcer, occurs when there is prolonged pressure on a specific area of the body, leading to tissue damage.
The time it takes for pressure damage to be visible can vary depending on several factors, such as the pressure intensity, the duration of pressure, and the individual's overall health.
However, in general, pressure damage can become visible within 24 hours of prolonged pressure. This is because the body's tissues can start to show signs of damage, such as redness, swelling, and blistering, within this timeframe.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Eccrine and apocrine glands are both types of: Choices: a) sweat glands. b) salivary glands. c) chemoreceptors. d) tear ducts. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the type of glands that are being compared. The question mentions eccrine and apocrine glands.
Next, I need to recall the function of these glands. Eccrine glands are responsible for producing sweat, which helps to regulate body temperature.
Apocrine glands are also responsible for producing sweat, but they are primarily found in the armpits and groin area and are involved in the production of pheromones.
Now, I need to compare the options. The question asks for the type of glands that eccrine and apocrine glands are both types of. The only option that matches this description is a) sweat glands.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Which of the following is true of the assessment of power in the arms? Choices: a) Grade 3/5 (MRC scale) represents movement of the arm only when gravity is eliminated b) Flexion at the elbow is produced by the triceps muscle c) The root value of shoulder abduction is C5 d) Grade 1/5 power represents no movement or muscle contraction 
Output:
First, I need to assess the options one by one.
Option a) Grade 3/5 (MRC scale) represents movement of the arm only when gravity is eliminated: This is incorrect because grade 3/5 represents movement against gravity but not against resistance.
Option b) Flexion at the elbow is produced by the triceps muscle: This is incorrect because flexion at the elbow is produced by the biceps muscle, not the triceps muscle.
Option c) The root value of shoulder abduction is C5: This is incorrect because the root value of shoulder abduction is C5-C6, not just C5.
Option d) Grade 1/5 power represents no movement or muscle contraction: This is correct because grade 1/5 power represents a flicker or trace of contraction, but no movement.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Two of the following are evident - pain at IV site, erythema, and swelling. What stage on the phlebitis scale is this and what should you do? Choices: a) Stage 1 - observe cannula. b) Stage 2 - re-site cannula. c) Stage 3 - re-site cannula and consider treatment. d) Stage 0 - do nothing. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms described. The symptoms are pain at the IV site, erythema, and swelling.
Next, I need to match these symptoms to the phlebitis scale. Phlebitis is inflammation of the vein, and the symptoms described are consistent with stage 2 phlebitis.
Now, I need to determine the appropriate action for stage 2 phlebitis. According to the phlebitis scale, stage 2 phlebitis requires re-siting the cannula.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which hormone is primarily responsible for fluid regulation? Choices: a) Antidiuretic hormone. b) Insulin. c) Adrenaline. d) Testosterone. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the hormone that is primarily responsible for fluid regulation. 
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is a hormone that helps regulate the amount of water in the body by controlling the amount of water reabsorbed by the kidneys. 
Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels, not fluid regulation. 
Adrenaline is a hormone that prepares the body for 'fight or flight' and is not primarily responsible for fluid regulation. 
Testosterone is a hormone that regulates male characteristics and is not primarily responsible for fluid regulation.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: The low intake of carbohydrate in the diet: Choices: a) does not influence exercise performance in events lasting less than 10 minutes. b) affects the resting muscle pH. c) may impair high intensity exercise performance. d) results in greater reliance on muscle glycogen during exercise. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the role of carbohydrates in exercise performance. Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for high-intensity, short-duration activities.
Next, I need to consider the impact of low carbohydrate intake on exercise performance. A low intake of carbohydrates can lead to a decrease in muscle glycogen stores, which can impair high-intensity exercise performance.
Now, I need to consider the relationship between carbohydrate intake and muscle pH. A low intake of carbohydrates can lead to an increase in muscle acidity, which can affect the resting muscle pH.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Phophocreatine resynthesis during recovery from exercise is inhibited by: Choices: a) an excess of creatine. b) hyperventilation. c) an excess of oxygen. d) a lack of oxygen. 
Output:
First, I need to understand what Phophocreatine resynthesis is. Phosphocreatine (PCr) is a high-energy compound that is used to replenish ATP stores during high-intensity exercise. The resynthesis of PCr is an important process that occurs during recovery from exercise.
Next, I need to consider the factors that can inhibit PCr resynthesis. One factor that can inhibit PCr resynthesis is a lack of oxygen. When oxygen is limited, the body cannot produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, which is necessary for PCr resynthesis.
Now, I need to evaluate the other options. An excess of creatine (a) would not inhibit PCr resynthesis, as creatine is actually a precursor to PCr. Hyperventilation (b) would actually increase oxygen availability, which would facilitate PCr resynthesis. An excess of oxygen (c) would also facilitate PCr resynthesis, as it would provide the necessary substrate for oxidative phosphorylation.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The transcription of DNA to a molecule of messenger RNA occurs: Choices: a) on the ribosomes. b) in the cytosol. c) in the nucleus. d) only during cell division. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the location where the transcription of DNA to messenger RNA occurs. The transcription process takes place in the nucleus, where the DNA is located.
Next, I need to understand the role of the nucleus in the process. The nucleus is the control center of the cell, and it contains the genetic material, which is the DNA. The transcription process involves the creation of a complementary RNA molecule from the DNA template.
Now, I need to eliminate the incorrect options. Option a) on the ribosomes is incorrect because the ribosomes are involved in protein synthesis, not transcription. Option b) in the cytosol is incorrect because the cytosol is the region outside the nucleus, and transcription does not occur there. Option d) only during cell division is incorrect because transcription occurs continuously in the cell, not just during cell division.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: Oedema is the presence of: Choices: a) excessive intravascular fluid. b) excessive extravascular fluid. c) excessive intracranial fluid. d) excessive necrotic cells. 
Output:
First, I need to understand what oedema is. Oedema is the accumulation of fluid in the body's tissues.
Next, I need to consider where the fluid accumulates. The fluid accumulates in the extravascular space, which is the space outside the blood vessels.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Why should the short-acting bronchodilator be taken first? Choices: a) It works to dilate the airways quickly, allowing better deposition of other medications. b) They are colour-coded. c) It is warmer than the others. d) It is less moist than the others. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the purpose of taking the short-acting bronchodilator first. The purpose is to dilate the airways quickly, allowing better deposition of other medications.
Next, I need to consider the options and eliminate the ones that are not related to the purpose. Options b, c, and d are not related to the purpose, so they can be eliminated.
Now, I need to choose the correct option. Option a is the correct answer because it states that the short-acting bronchodilator works to dilate the airways quickly, allowing better deposition of other medications.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true about an intention tremor? Choices: a) It is worse at rest b) It is caused by Parkinson's Disease c) It is indicative of a cerebellar lesion d) Dyscalculia is a common association 
Output:
First, I need to identify the characteristics of an intention tremor. An intention tremor is a type of tremor that occurs when a person is trying to make a voluntary movement, such as reaching for an object.
Next, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) states that an intention tremor is worse at rest, but this is actually a characteristic of a resting tremor, not an intention tremor.
Option b) states that an intention tremor is caused by Parkinson's Disease, but this is not accurate. Parkinson's Disease is associated with a resting tremor, not an intention tremor.
Option c) states that an intention tremor is indicative of a cerebellar lesion, which is true. The cerebellum is responsible for coordinating movement, and damage to this area can result in an intention tremor.
Option d) states that dyscalculia is a common association with an intention tremor, but this is not accurate.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Glucose is transported into the muscle cell: Choices: a) via protein transporters called GLUT4. b) only in the presence of insulin. c) via hexokinase. d) via monocarbylic acid transporters. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the correct mechanism of glucose transport into the muscle cell. Glucose is transported into the muscle cell via protein transporters called GLUT4.
Next, I need to consider the role of insulin in glucose transport. Insulin is not required for glucose transport into the muscle cell via GLUT4.
Now, I need to consider the other options. Hexokinase is an enzyme that phosphorylates glucose, but it is not involved in transporting glucose into the muscle cell. Monocarboxylic acid transporters are involved in transporting lactate and other monocarboxylic acids, not glucose.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Oxygen is used: Choices: a) in glycolysis. b) in the conversion of fatty acids to acetyl CoA. c) in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle). d) in glycogenolysis. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the process where oxygen is used. Glycolysis is the process of breaking down glucose to pyruvate, but it does not require oxygen.
Next, the conversion of fatty acids to acetyl CoA is a process that occurs in the mitochondria, but it does not require oxygen either.
Then, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle) is a process that occurs in the mitochondria and requires oxygen to produce ATP.
Finally, glycogenolysis is the process of breaking down glycogen to glucose, but it does not require oxygen.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

First, I need to understand the relationship between blood pressure and the position of the arm. When the arm is above the level of the heart, the blood pressure in the arm is lower than the actual blood pressure in the body.
Next, I need to consider how this affects the measurement. When the arm is above the level of the heart, the blood pressure in the arm is lower than the actual blood pressure, so the measurement will be lower than the actual blood pressure.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: When you are taking a musculoskeletal history which of the following is true? Choices: a) Drugs may be implicated in the causation of gout b) A history of diarrhoea is not relevant c) Difficulty rising from a chair is diagnostic of polymyalgic rheumatica d) Joint stiffness of 5 minutes duration suggests an arthropathy 
Output:
First, I need to consider the options and determine which one is true. 
Option a) Drugs may be implicated in the causation of gout is true, as certain medications, such as diuretics and aspirin, can increase the risk of developing gout.
Option b) A history of diarrhoea is not relevant is not true, as gastrointestinal symptoms can be associated with various musculoskeletal conditions, such as ankylosing spondylitis.
Option c) Difficulty rising from a chair is diagnostic of polymyalgic rheumatica is not true, as this symptom can be associated with other conditions, such as osteoarthritis.
Option d) Joint stiffness of 5 minutes duration suggests an arthropathy is not true, as joint stiffness can be a normal response to rest and is not specific to arthropathies.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Why are male patients advised to take their own electric razor to hospital? Choices: a) For patient comfort. b) To make hospital as familiar as possible. c) To minimize risk of cross-infection. d) To allow shaving at a time convenient to the patient.

"Input: Which organ secretes insulin? Choices: a) The gastric parietal cells. b) The pancreas. c) The walls of the large intestine. d) The autonomic nervous system. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the function of the organ in question. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels.
Next, I need to consider the options. The gastric parietal cells secrete gastric acid, the walls of the large intestine secrete mucus, and the autonomic nervous system is a system of nerves that controls involuntary actions. None of these organs secrete insulin.
Now, I need to consider the remaining option, which is the pancreas. The pancreas is an organ that secretes digestive enzymes and hormones, including insulin.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: When teaching a patient inhaler technique, how will you ensure that a large proportion of the drug reaches the lower airways? Choices: a) Ask them to take lots of small, quick breaths in before using the inhaler. b) Ask them to breathe normally when using the inhaler. c) Ask them to perform the procedure as quickly as they can. d) Ask them to hold their breath at the end of the inspiration on using the inhaler. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the goal of the question, which is to ensure that a large proportion of the drug reaches the lower airways when teaching a patient inhaler technique.
Next, I need to consider the anatomy of the respiratory system and how the drug is delivered. The lower airways are located deeper in the lungs, and the drug needs to be inhaled deeply to reach them.
Now, I need to evaluate the options based on their effectiveness in achieving this goal. Option a) asks the patient to take lots of small, quick breaths in before using the inhaler, which would likely help to fill the lungs and reach the lower airways. Option b) asks the patient to breathe normally, which may not be enough to reach the lower airways. Option c) asks the patient to perform the procedure as quickly as they can, which may not ensure that the drug is inhaled deeply enough. Option d) asks the patient to hold their breath at the end of the inspiration, which may help to keep the drug in the lungs for a longer period but may not ensure that it reaches the lower airways.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Why should a patient stand or sit as upright as possible when recording a peak flow rate? Choices: a) To ensure best lung expansion and accuracy and consistency of readings. b) This is the most comfortable position to perform any breathing test. c) The counter on the meter will not move if the patient is lying down. d) To ensure that their technique can be observed easily. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the purpose of recording a peak flow rate. The goal is to measure the patient's lung function, specifically the rate at which they can expel air from their lungs.
Next, I need to think about how the patient's position might affect the measurement. If the patient is lying down, their lungs may not expand as fully, which could lead to inaccurate readings.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) mentions ensuring best lung expansion and accuracy and consistency of readings, which aligns with the goal of accurately measuring lung function.
Option b) mentions comfort, but this is not the primary concern when recording a peak flow rate.
Option c) mentions the counter on the meter, but this is not relevant to the patient's position.
Option d) mentions observing the patient's technique, but this is not the primary reason for standing or sitting upright.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Why might a patient need a tracheostomy? Choices: a) To repair vocal cords after paralysis. b) To aid swallowing. c) As an aid to weaning patients from a ventilator. d) Prior to neck surgery. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the purpose of a tracheostomy. A tracheostomy is a surgical procedure that creates an airway in the neck, bypassing the upper airway.
Next, I need to evaluate each option. Option a) is incorrect because a tracheostomy is not used to repair vocal cords. Option b) is incorrect because a tracheostomy is not used to aid swallowing. Option d) is incorrect because a tracheostomy is not typically performed prior to neck surgery.
Now, I need to consider option c) as an aid to weaning patients from a ventilator. A tracheostomy can be used to wean patients from a ventilator because it allows for more control over the airway and can make it easier to remove the ventilator.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: In general, the higher the intensity of exercise, the greater the proportional contribution of: Choices: a) aerobic energy production. b) anaerobic energy production. c) the TCA cycle (Krebs' cycle) to the production of ATP. d) the electron transfer chain to the production of ATP. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the relationship between exercise intensity and energy production. When the intensity of exercise is high, the body needs to produce energy quickly to meet the demand.
Next, I need to consider the different types of energy production. Aerobic energy production is a slow process that uses oxygen to produce energy, while anaerobic energy production is a fast process that does not use oxygen.
Now, I need to determine which type of energy production is more relevant to high-intensity exercise. Anaerobic energy production is more relevant to high-intensity exercise because it allows the body to produce energy quickly without using oxygen.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: What is the second commonest hospital acquired infection? Choices: a) Urinary infection. b) Wound infection. c) Upper respiratory tract infection. d) Ventilator-associated pneumonia. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the commonest hospital acquired infection. The commonest hospital acquired infection is urinary infection.
Next, I need to compare the options to find the second commonest hospital acquired infection. 
Wound infection is the second commonest hospital acquired infection.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Phosphocreatine in the muscle cell is found in: Choices: a) the mitochondria. b) all subcellular compartments. c) the sarcolemma. d) the cytoplasm. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the correct location of phosphocreatine in the muscle cell. Phosphocreatine is a high-energy compound that plays a crucial role in muscle contraction.
Next, I need to consider the function of each option. The mitochondria are the site of cellular respiration and energy production, but they are not the primary location of phosphocreatine. The sarcolemma is the plasma membrane of the muscle cell, and it is not directly involved in energy metabolism. The cytoplasm is the region between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope, and it is where many metabolic reactions occur, including those involving phosphocreatine.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: The patient's self-report of pain is important because health care staff: Choices: a) can overestimate the intensity of the patient's pain. b) underestimate the intensity of the patient's pain. c) do not possess an objective way of assessing pain. d) can use the information to prescribe and administer the least possible amount of pain relief. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the importance of the patient's self-report of pain. The patient's self-report is a subjective measure, but it is still an important tool for health care staff to assess the patient's pain.
Next, I need to consider the potential biases of health care staff. Health care staff may have their own biases and assumptions about the patient's pain, which can affect their assessment.
Now, I need to consider the options. Option a) is incorrect because health care staff are not likely to overestimate the intensity of the patient's pain. Option b) is correct because health care staff may underestimate the intensity of the patient's pain due to their own biases and assumptions. Option c) is incorrect because health care staff do have objective ways of assessing pain, such as using pain scales and other assessment tools. Option d) is incorrect because while health care staff can use the patient's self-report to inform their treatment decisions, it is not the primary reason why the patient's self-report is important.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
