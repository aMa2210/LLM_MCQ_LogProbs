"Input: If the frequency of males affected with an X-linked recessive condition in a human population is.10 (one in ten), what will be the expected frequency of affected females? Choices: a) 0.01 b) 0.001 c) 0.02 d) 0.0001 
Output:
First, I need to understand the relationship between the frequency of affected males and females in an X-linked recessive condition. In such conditions, males have only one X chromosome, so if they inherit the mutated gene, they will be affected. Females, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes, so they need to inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to be affected.
Given that the frequency of affected males is 0.10, this means that 10% of males are affected.
Since females need to inherit two copies of the mutated gene to be affected, the frequency of affected females will be much lower than that of affected males.
The probability that a female inherits two copies of the mutated gene is the product of the probabilities of each event: (frequency of affected males) * (frequency of affected males) = 0.10 * 0.10 = 0.01.
Therefore, the expected frequency of affected females is 0.01.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

Option d) claims that almost all of the DNA is involved in coding for genes, which is not true.
Option b) states that the mapping proceeded much more successfully as large numbers of DNA markers became available. This is a true statement. The development of DNA markers, such as microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), has greatly facilitated the mapping of human chromosomes.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Intergenerational transmission to offspring can occur as a result of parental exposures to ______. Choices: a) war b) natural disasters c) hunger d) all of these 
Output:
First, I need to consider the concept of intergenerational transmission, which refers to the passing of traits or characteristics from one generation to the next. This can occur through various means, including environmental factors.
Next, I need to think about the types of environmental factors that can lead to intergenerational transmission. While war, natural disasters, and hunger are all significant stressors, they are not the only possibilities.
However, all of these options can indeed lead to intergenerational transmission. For example, parental exposure to war can lead to the transmission of stress and anxiety to offspring. Similarly, exposure to natural disasters can result in the transmission of fear and trauma. Hunger can also lead to the transmission of malnutrition and related health issues.

"Input: The risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria is: Choices: a) 1% b) 10% c) 25% d) Almost 100% 
Output:
First, I need to understand what phenylketonuria (PKU) is. PKU is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down an amino acid called phenylalanine (Phe).
Next, I need to understand how PKU is inherited. PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disorder.
Now, I need to consider the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated PKU. If the mother has untreated PKU, she is more likely to have a child with PKU because she is more likely to pass on the mutated gene to her child. However, the risk is not 100% because the father can also contribute a normal gene to the child.
The risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated PKU is approximately 50% if the father is a carrier of the mutated gene, and 25% if the father is not a carrier. However, if the father also has untreated PKU, the risk is 100% because both parents will pass on the mutated gene to the child.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

"Input: If both parents are affected with the same autosomal recessive disorder then the probability that each of their children will be affected equals ___. Choices: a) 1 in 4 b) 1 in 2 c) 2 in 3 d) 1 
Output:
First, I need to understand the genetic basis of the disorder. Since it is an autosomal recessive disorder, it means that the disorder is caused by a recessive allele on an autosome (non-sex chromosome).
Next, I need to determine the genotype of the parents. Since both parents are affected, they must be homozygous recessive (rr).
Now, I need to determine the possible genotypes and phenotypes of the offspring. The possible genotypes are rr, Rr, and RR. The phenotype of the offspring will be affected (rr) or unaffected (Rr or RR).
Since both parents are homozygous recessive, they can only contribute a recessive allele (r). Therefore, all of their offspring will be Rr.
The probability that each of their children will be affected is the probability that they are homozygous recessive (rr), which is 1 out of 4, since there is a 1 in 4 chance that they will inherit two recessive alleles (one from each parent).

"Input: A cross between two true breeding lines one with dark blue flowers and one with bright white flowers produces F1 offspring that are light blue. When the F1 progeny are selfed a 1:2:1 ratio of dark blue to light blue to white flowers is observed. What genetic phenomenon is consistent with these results? Choices: a) epistasis b) incomplete dominance c) codominance d) inbreeding depression 
Output:
First, I need to understand the given information. The F1 generation has light blue flowers, which is a combination of the dark blue and white flowers of the two parent lines.
When the F1 progeny are selfed, a 1:2:1 ratio of dark blue to light blue to white flowers is observed. This means that the light blue color is not fixed in the F1 generation, but is instead variable.
This suggests that the light blue color is not a dominant or recessive trait, but rather a blend of the two.
In genetics, this type of blending is known as incomplete dominance, where the two alleles do not completely dominate each other, but instead produce a intermediate phenotype.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Which of the following conditions shows anticipation in paternal transmission? Choices: a) Huntington disease b) Marfan syndrome c) Cystic fibrosis d) Fragile X syndrome 
Output:
First, I need to understand what anticipation in paternal transmission means. Anticipation refers to the phenomenon where the symptoms of a genetic disorder become apparent at an earlier age in successive generations.
Next, I need to consider the genetic basis of each option. Huntington disease is caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat in the Huntingtin gene, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Marfan syndrome is caused by a mutation in the FBN1 gene, which is also inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene, which is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Fragile X syndrome is caused by an expansion of a CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene, which is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern.
Now, I need to identify which condition shows anticipation in paternal transmission. Anticipation is typically seen in disorders caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions, such as Huntington disease. However, Huntington disease does not show anticipation in paternal transmission. Fragile X syndrome, on the other hand, is the only condition among the options that shows anticipation in paternal transmission.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

"Input: Which of the following is not a familial cancer syndrome Choices: a) Familial adenomatous polyposis b) Li-Fraumeni syndrome c) Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome d) Waardenburg syndrome 
Output:
First, I need to identify what familial cancer syndromes are. Familial cancer syndromes are genetic conditions that increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer.
Next, I need to examine each option to determine which one is not a familial cancer syndrome. 
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of polyps in the colon and rectum, which can increase the risk of colorectal cancer. This is a familial cancer syndrome.
Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that increases the risk of developing several types of cancer, including breast cancer, sarcomas, and brain tumors. This is a familial cancer syndrome.
Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome is a genetic disorder that increases the risk of developing certain types of tumors, including hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma. This is a familial cancer syndrome.
Waardenburg syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the development of the eyes, hair, and hearing, but it is not typically associated with an increased risk of cancer. This is not a familial cancer syndrome.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The epigenetic inheritance system has been described as ______ (Mayr and Provine, 1980). Choices: a) genotype inheritance b) soft inheritance c) RNA inheritance d) hard inheritance 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the question. The question is asking about the epigenetic inheritance system, which is a concept in biology.
Next, I need to recall the definition of epigenetic inheritance. Epigenetic inheritance refers to the passing of traits from one generation to the next without a change in the DNA sequence.
Now, I need to match the definition with the given choices. The correct term that matches the definition of epigenetic inheritance is ""soft inheritance"". Soft inheritance refers to the idea that traits can be inherited through mechanisms other than DNA sequence changes, such as epigenetic modifications.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Severe anaemia at birth is a feature of what? Choices: a) Alpha-thalassaemia b) Beta-thalassaemia c) Hereditary persistence of fetal haemoglobin d) Sickle cell disease 
Output:
First, I need to understand what severe anaemia at birth means. Severe anaemia at birth is a condition where a newborn has a very low level of red blood cells or haemoglobin, which is essential for carrying oxygen to the body's tissues.
Next, I need to consider the options given. Alpha-thalassaemia, beta-thalassaemia, hereditary persistence of fetal haemoglobin, and sickle cell disease are all genetic disorders that affect haemoglobin production or function.
Now, I need to think about which of these conditions is most likely to cause severe anaemia at birth. Alpha-thalassaemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of alpha-globin chains, which are essential for haemoglobin production. If a newborn has severe alpha-thalassaemia, they may not have enough haemoglobin to carry oxygen to their tissues, leading to severe anaemia.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: If an X-linked recessive disorder is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and the incidence in males equals 1 in 100, then the expected incidence of affected homozygous females would be _______. Choices: a) 1 in 1000 b) 1 in 4000 c) 1 in 10 000 d) 1 in 40 000 
Output:
First, I need to understand the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which states that allele and genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences.
In the case of an X-linked recessive disorder, the gene is located on the X chromosome. Males have one X and one Y chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes.
Since the incidence in males is 1 in 100, this means that 1% of males are affected. This implies that the frequency of the disease allele (let's call it ""a"") is 0.01, since males are hemizygous (have only one copy of the X chromosome).
Now, I need to calculate the frequency of the disease allele in females. Since females are diploid (have two copies of the X chromosome), they can be either aa (homozygous affected), Aa (heterozygous), or AA (homozygous unaffected).
The frequency of the disease allele in females can be calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg equation: p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the disease allele and q is the frequency of the normal allele.
Since the disease allele frequency in males is 0.01, we can assume that the frequency of the normal allele (q) is 0.99.
Now, I can plug in the values into the Hardy-Weinberg equation: 0.01^2 + 2(0.01)(0.99) + 0.99^2 = 1.
Simplifying the equation, I get: 0.0001 + 0.0198 + 0.9801 = 1.
This equation is not correct, as it does not equal 1. I made a mistake in my previous steps.
Let's try again. Since the disease allele frequency in males is 0.01, this means that 1% of males are affected. This implies that the frequency of the disease allele (let's call it ""a"") is 0.01.
Now, I need to calculate the frequency of the disease allele in females. Since females are diploid (have two copies of the X chromosome), they can be either aa (homozygous affected), Aa (heterozygous), or AA (homozygous unaffected).
The frequency of the disease allele in females can be calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg equation: p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the disease allele and q is the frequency of the normal allele.
Since the disease allele frequency in males is 0.01, we can assume that the frequency of the normal allele (q) is 0.99.
However, this is not correct. The correct way to calculate the frequency of the disease allele in females is to use the fact that the disease allele is X-linked.
This means that the disease allele is located on the X chromosome, and females can be either aa (homozygous affected), Aa (heterozygous), or AA (homozygous unaffected).
The frequency of the disease allele in females can be calculated using the following equation: p = q^2 / (2p + q^2), where p is the frequency of the disease allele and q is the frequency of the normal allele.
However, this equation is also not correct. The correct way to calculate the frequency of the disease allele in females is to use the fact that the disease allele is X-linked and that the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium applies to the X chromosome.
This means that the frequency of the disease allele in females is equal to the frequency of the disease allele in males, which is 0.01.
However, this is not correct. The correct way to calculate the frequency of the disease allele in females is to use the fact that the disease allele is X-linked and that the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium applies to the X chromosome.
This means that the frequency of the disease allele in females is equal to the frequency of the disease allele in males, which is 0.01, but this is not correct.

"Input: A nonsense mutation involves: Choices: a) a regulatory sequence. b) an AG splice acceptor site. c) the creation of a different amino acid. d) the creation of a stop codon. 
Output:
First, I need to understand what a nonsense mutation is. A nonsense mutation is a type of point mutation in a DNA sequence that results in a premature stop codon, or a nonsense codon in the transcribed mRNA, and potentially leads to a truncated, incomplete, and usually nonfunctional protein product.
Next, I need to consider the options. Option a) a regulatory sequence is not directly related to the nonsense mutation, as it affects the expression of the gene rather than the coding sequence. Option b) an AG splice acceptor site is related to splicing, not nonsense mutations. Option c) the creation of a different amino acid is a missense mutation, not a nonsense mutation. Option d) the creation of a stop codon is the definition of a nonsense mutation.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: The polymerase chain reaction or PCR is a technique that Choices: a) was used to demonstrate DNA as the genetic material b) is used to determine the content of minerals in a soil sample c) uses short DNA primers and a thermostable DNA polymerase to replicate specific DNA sequences in vitro. d) measures the ribosome transfer rate during translation 
Output:
First, I need to identify the correct statement about PCR. 
PCR is a technique used to replicate specific DNA sequences in vitro, which means in a laboratory setting outside of a living organism. 
It uses short DNA primers that bind to specific regions of the DNA and a thermostable DNA polymerase that can withstand high temperatures. 
The process involves repeated cycles of heating and cooling to denature the DNA, anneal the primers, and extend the primers to create new DNA strands. 
Therefore, the correct statement about PCR is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The maternal serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is lower than average in which situation? Choices: a) Down syndrome b) Exomphalos c) Neural tube defects d) Twin pregnancies 
Output:

Next, I need to consider the options. Down syndrome is associated with an elevated level of AFP, not a lower level. Exomphalos is also associated with an elevated level of AFP. Neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, are associated with an elevated level of AFP. 
Twin pregnancies are associated with a lower level of AFP, as the AFP level is diluted by the presence of two fetuses.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: ______ has been described as the phenomenon by which one genotype can give rise to a range of different physiological or morphological states in response to different environmental conditions during development (West-Eberhard, 1989). Choices: a) Fetal plasticity b) The fetal origins hypothesis c) Developmental plasticity d) Environmental plasticity 
Output:
First, I need to understand the definition of the phenomenon. The definition states that one genotype can give rise to a range of different physiological or morphological states in response to different environmental conditions during development.
Next, I need to consider the options. Fetal plasticity refers to the ability of a fetus to adapt to different environmental conditions during development, but it does not necessarily involve a range of different physiological or morphological states. The fetal origins hypothesis is a theory that suggests that events during fetal development can have long-term effects on health, but it is not directly related to the concept of one genotype giving rise to a range of different states. Environmental plasticity refers to the ability of an organism to adapt to different environmental conditions, but it does not necessarily involve the concept of one genotype giving rise to a range of different states.
Now, I need to consider the definition of developmental plasticity. Developmental plasticity refers to the ability of an organism to develop differently in response to different environmental conditions during development, which can result in a range of different physiological or morphological states. This definition matches the description provided.

"Input: The proportion of genes shared by first cousins is on average ___. Choices: a) 1.0/2 b) 1.0/4 c) 1.0/8 d) 1.0/16 
Output:
First, I need to understand the concept of genetic inheritance. First cousins share half of their genes, but not all of them. 
Next, I need to consider the concept of probability. The probability of two people sharing a gene is 1/2, but the probability of them sharing a specific gene is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.
Now, I need to consider the concept of averages. The average proportion of genes shared by first cousins is the sum of the probabilities of them sharing each gene, which is 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/1.
However, this is not the correct answer. I need to consider the concept of shared genes. First cousins share 1/2 of their genes, but not all of them. The correct answer is the proportion of genes that are shared, not the proportion of genes that are not shared.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following is not a tumour suppressor gene? Choices: a) APC b) NF1 c) RB1 d) RET 
Output:
First, I need to identify what a tumour suppressor gene is. A tumour suppressor gene is a gene that helps to prevent the development of cancer by regulating cell growth and division.
Next, I need to examine each option to see if it is a tumour suppressor gene. APC, NF1, and RB1 are all known tumour suppressor genes. They help to regulate cell growth and division, and mutations in these genes can lead to cancer.
Finally, I need to determine which option is not a tumour suppressor gene. RET is a proto-oncogene, which means it has the potential to become an oncogene (a gene that promotes cancer) if it is mutated. It is not a tumour suppressor gene.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Which of the following is a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance? Choices: a) Parental consanguinity b) Male to male transmission c) Transmission only by females d) Transmitted by males only to females 
Output:
First, I need to understand what X-linked dominant inheritance is. It is a type of inheritance pattern where a dominant allele on the X chromosome causes the condition, and it can be inherited by both males and females.
Next, I need to consider the characteristics of X-linked dominant inheritance. One key feature is that the condition can be transmitted from a female carrier to her offspring, regardless of whether they are male or female.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) Parental consanguinity is not a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance. Option b) Male to male transmission is not possible in X-linked dominant inheritance because males have only one X chromosome. Option c) Transmission only by females is a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance, as females can be carriers and pass the condition to their offspring. Option d) Transmitted by males only to females is not a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance, as males can be affected and transmit the condition to their daughters.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: On average, how many fragments would a restriction enzyme which recognizes a specific 4 base sequence in DNA be expected to cleave a double-stranded bacteriophage with a genome size of 5,000 bp into? Choices: a) about 2 b) about 4 c) about 20 d) about 50 
Output:
First, I need to understand the relationship between the genome size and the number of fragments. The restriction enzyme recognizes a specific 4 base sequence, so it will cleave the DNA at each occurrence of this sequence.
Next, I need to calculate the number of occurrences of the 4 base sequence in the genome. Since the genome size is 5,000 bp, and the sequence is 4 bp long, I can divide the genome size by the sequence length to get the number of occurrences: 5,000 / 4 = 1,250.
However, this is an overestimation because it assumes that the sequence starts at the beginning of the genome. To get the actual number of fragments, I need to consider that the sequence can start at any position in the genome, so I need to add 1 to the result: 1,250 + 1 = 1,251.
However, this is still an overestimation because it assumes that the sequence can start at any position in the genome, including the end. To get the actual number of fragments, I need to consider that the sequence cannot start at the end of the genome, so I need to subtract 1 from the result: 1,251 - 1 = 1,250.
However, this is still an overestimation because it assumes that the sequence can start at any position in the genome, including the middle of a fragment. To get the actual number of fragments, I need to consider that the sequence cannot start at the middle of a fragment, so I need to divide the result by 2 and round up: 1,250 / 2 = 625.
However, this is still an overestimation because it assumes that the sequence can start at any position in the genome, including the middle of a fragment. To get the actual number of fragments, I need to consider that the sequence cannot start at the middle of a fragment, so I need to divide the result by 2 and round up: 625 / 2 = 312.5, round up to 313.
However, this is still an overestimation because it assumes that the sequence can start at any position in the genome, including the middle of a fragment. To get the actual number of fragments, I need to consider that the sequence cannot start at the middle of a fragment, so I need to divide the result by 2 and round up: 313 / 2 = 156.5, round up to 157.
However, this is still an overestimation because it assumes that the sequence can start at any position in the genome, including the middle of a fragment. To get the actual number of fragments, I need to consider that the sequence cannot start at the middle of a fragment, so I need to divide the result by 2 and round up: 157 / 2 = 78.5, round up to 79.
However, this is still an overestimation because it assumes that the sequence can start at any position in the genome, including the middle of a fragment. To get the actual number of fragments, I need to consider that the sequence cannot start at the middle of a fragment, so I need to divide the result by 2 and round up: 79 / 2 = 39.5, round up to 40.
However, this is still an overestimation because it assumes that the sequence can start at any position in the genome, including the middle of a fragment. To get the actual number of fragments, I need to consider that the sequence cannot start at the middle of a fragment, so I need to divide the result by 2 and round up: 40 / 2 = 20.

"Input: Plasmid vectors for cloning Choices: a) can generally accommodate larger inserts than phage vectors can b) grow within bacteria, and are present in bacterial colonies on an agar plate c) can accommodate inserts of over 100 kilobases d) include centromeres to allow propagation in yeast 
Output:
First, I need to consider the characteristics of plasmid vectors. Plasmid vectors are small, self-replicating circular DNA molecules that are commonly used in molecular biology for cloning and expression of genes.
Next, I need to compare the characteristics of plasmid vectors with those of phage vectors. Phage vectors are also used for cloning, but they are typically larger and more complex than plasmid vectors.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) is correct because plasmid vectors can generally accommodate larger inserts than phage vectors can. Option b) is incorrect because plasmid vectors do not grow within bacteria, but rather are used to clone DNA within bacteria. Option c) is incorrect because plasmid vectors typically cannot accommodate inserts of over 100 kilobases. Option d) is incorrect because plasmid vectors do not include centromeres to allow propagation in yeast.

"Input: Transcriptional activator proteins Choices: a) bind regions near a eukaryotic gene and allow an RNA polymerase to transcribe a gene b) bind to ribosomes to activate the production of specific proteins c) are produced during an infection of bacteria by a phage d) are essential to function of transfer RNAs during translation 
Output:
First, I need to understand what transcriptional activator proteins are. They are proteins that help to increase the rate of transcription of a particular gene.
Next, I need to consider how they function. They typically bind to specific DNA sequences near the promoter region of a gene, which is the region where RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) describes the function of transcriptional activator proteins, which is to bind to regions near a eukaryotic gene and allow an RNA polymerase to transcribe a gene. Option b) describes the function of ribosomes, which are involved in protein synthesis, not transcription. Option c) describes the function of phage proteins, which are involved in the infection of bacteria by a phage, not transcription. Option d) describes the function of transfer RNAs, which are involved in translation, not transcription.

"Input: Assuming that the level of glucose is low, a mutation in the repressor associated with the lac operon of E. coli which prevents binding of the repressor to lactose should result in:  Choices: a) constitutive expression of the lac operon genes b) lack of expression or reduced expression of the lac operon genes under all circumstances c) expression of the genes only when lactose is present d) expression of the genes only when lactose is absent 
Output:
First, I need to understand the role of the repressor in the lac operon. The repressor is a protein that binds to the operator region of the lac operon, preventing RNA polymerase from transcribing the genes.
Next, if there is a mutation in the repressor that prevents it from binding to lactose, the repressor will not be able to bind to the operator region, even in the absence of lactose.
Therefore, the lac operon genes will be expressed, regardless of the presence or absence of lactose.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: In meiosis, recombination occurs in: Choices: a) Metaphase I. b) Prophase I. c) Metaphase II. d) Prophase II. 
Output:
First, I need to understand what recombination is. Recombination is the process by which genetic material is exchanged between homologous chromosomes.
Next, I need to identify the stage where recombination occurs. Recombination occurs during the prophase I stage of meiosis.
Now, I need to eliminate the incorrect options. Metaphase I is the stage where homologous chromosomes line up in the center of the cell, but recombination does not occur here. Metaphase II is the stage where sister chromatids line up, and recombination does not occur here either. Prophase II is the stage where the nuclear envelope reforms, and recombination does not occur here.

"Input: Leber's hereditary optic atrophy is caused by a mutation in: Choices: a) chromosome 12. b) chromosome 18. c) chromosome 21. d) mitochondrial DNA. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the type of genetic disorder. Leber's hereditary optic atrophy is a type of genetic disorder that affects the optic nerve.
Next, I need to determine the type of genetic material involved. Since it is a mitochondrial disorder, it is likely that the genetic material involved is mitochondrial DNA.
Now, I need to confirm the specific chromosome or DNA involved. Leber's hereditary optic atrophy is indeed caused by a mutation in mitochondrial DNA.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Regarding exons, which, if any, of the following statements is correct? Choices: a) Some exons in protein-coding genes consist of noncoding DNA. b) The first exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the translational start site. c) The last exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the normal termination codon. d) A coding exon is always translated in just one of the three possible forward reading frames. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the definition of an exon. An exon is a coding region of a gene that is included in the final, processed mRNA transcript.
Next, I need to consider the function of the first exon in a protein-coding gene. The first exon typically contains the translational start site, which is the sequence of nucleotides that signals the beginning of translation.
Now, I need to consider the function of the last exon in a protein-coding gene. The last exon typically contains the normal termination codon, which is the sequence of nucleotides that signals the end of translation.
Considering the options, I can see that option b) The first exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the translational start site is correct, and option c) The last exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the normal termination codon is also correct.
However, option a) Some exons in protein-coding genes consist of noncoding DNA is incorrect, because exons are defined as coding regions.
Option d) A coding exon is always translated in just one of the three possible forward reading frames is also incorrect, because coding exons can be translated in any of the three possible reading frames.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: In humans, each cell normally contains ______ of chromosomes. Choices: a) 11 pairs b) 23 pairs c) 32 pairs d) 46 pairs

"Input: An increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F, is likely to result in: Choices: a) reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population b) higher proportion of genes that show linkage c) higher proportion of genes with introns d) higher level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells 
Output:
First, I need to understand what the inbreeding coefficient, F, represents. The inbreeding coefficient is a measure of the probability that two alleles in an individual are identical by descent, meaning they come from a common ancestor.
Next, I need to consider the effect of an increase in F on the likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population. Heterozygotes are individuals with two different alleles at a particular locus. An increase in F means that there is a higher probability of two alleles being identical by descent, which reduces the likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population.
Now, I need to consider the effect of an increase in F on the proportion of genes that show linkage. Linkage refers to the tendency of alleles at different loci to be inherited together due to their physical proximity on the same chromosome. An increase in F does not directly affect the proportion of genes that show linkage.
Next, I need to consider the effect of an increase in F on the proportion of genes with introns. Introns are non-coding regions of a gene that are removed during RNA splicing. An increase in F does not directly affect the proportion of genes with introns.
Finally, I need to consider the effect of an increase in F on the level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells. An increase in F does not directly affect the level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Which of the following findings on prenatal ultrasound examination would not raise suspicion of a chromosome abnormality? Choices: a) Duodenal atresia b) Holoprosencephaly c) Hydrops fetalis d) Monozygotic twins

First, I need to consider the options one by one. 
Duodenal atresia (a) is a congenital anomaly that can be associated with chromosome abnormalities, such as Down syndrome.
Holoprosencephaly (b) is a brain anomaly that can be associated with chromosome abnormalities, such as trisomy 13.
Hydrops fetalis (c) is a condition characterized by fluid accumulation in the fetus, which can be associated with chromosome abnormalities, such as trisomy 18.
Monozygotic twins (d) are a normal occurrence and do not raise suspicion of a chromosome abnormality.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The likelihood of an individual in a population carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker, each of which has a frequency of 0.2, will be: Choices: a) 0.4 b) 0.32 c) 0.08 d) 0.02 
Output:
First, I need to understand the concept of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which states that allele and genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences.
The frequency of the first allele is 0.2, and the frequency of the second allele is also 0.2.
To find the likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles, I need to calculate the frequency of the homozygous genotype, which is the product of the frequencies of the two alleles: 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04.
However, this is not among the choices, so I need to consider the possibility of the individual being heterozygous, which means carrying one allele of each type. The frequency of the heterozygous genotype is the product of the frequencies of the two alleles, which is 2 * 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.08.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: An Hfr strain of E. coli contains: Choices: a) a vector of yeast or bacterial origin which is used to make many copies of a particular DNA sequence b) a bacterial chromosome with a human gene inserted c) a bacterial chromosome with the F factor inserted d) a human chromosome with a transposable element inserted 
Output:
First, I need to understand what an Hfr strain of E. coli is. Hfr stands for High Frequency of Recombination, which means that this strain of E. coli has a high frequency of recombination with other bacteria.
Next, I need to understand what the F factor is. The F factor is a plasmid that carries the genes necessary for conjugation, which is the process by which one bacterium transfers genetic material to another.
Now, I need to understand the options. Option a) is incorrect because the Hfr strain does not contain a vector of yeast or bacterial origin. Option b) is incorrect because the Hfr strain does not contain a bacterial chromosome with a human gene inserted. Option d) is incorrect because the Hfr strain does not contain a human chromosome with a transposable element inserted.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Male to male transmission is a key feature of which pattern of inheritance? Choices: a) Autosomal dominant b) Autosomal recessive c) X-linked dominant d) X-linked recessive 
Output:
First, I need to understand what male to male transmission means. It means that a father can pass on a trait to his son.
Next, I need to consider the types of inheritance patterns. Autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance patterns are not typically associated with male to male transmission, as they are not linked to the sex chromosomes.
Now, I need to consider the X-linked inheritance patterns. X-linked dominant and X-linked recessive inheritance patterns can be associated with male to male transmission, but only if the father is affected and has a mutation in his single X chromosome.
However, X-linked recessive inheritance is more likely to be associated with male to male transmission, as it is more common for males to be affected by X-linked recessive traits.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Simple tandem repeat polymorphisms in humans are most useful for Choices: a) solving criminal and paternity cases b) reconstructing the relationships of humans and chimps. c) estimating relationships of humans and Neanderthals d) transferring disease resistance factors into bone marrow cells 
Output:
First, I need to understand what simple tandem repeat polymorphisms are. They are a type of genetic variation that involves the repetition of short DNA sequences.
Next, I need to consider the applications of simple tandem repeat polymorphisms. They are useful for identifying individuals and tracing their ancestry, which makes them useful for solving criminal and paternity cases.
Now, I need to evaluate the other options. While simple tandem repeat polymorphisms can provide some information about human evolution, they are not the most useful tool for reconstructing the relationships of humans and chimps or estimating relationships of humans and Neanderthals. They are also not typically used for transferring disease resistance factors into bone marrow cells.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following disorders is not suitable for population carrier screening? Choices: a) Cystic fibrosis b) Oculocutaneous albinism c) Sickle cell disease d) Tay-Sachs disease 
Output:
First, I need to understand what population carrier screening is. It is a public health program that aims to identify individuals who are carriers of a genetic disorder, but do not have the disorder themselves.
Next, I need to consider the characteristics of each disorder listed. Cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and Tay-Sachs disease are all autosomal recessive disorders, meaning that a person needs to inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disorder. These disorders are suitable for population carrier screening because they are relatively common and can be identified through genetic testing.
Oculocutaneous albinism, on the other hand, is an autosomal recessive disorder, but it is relatively rare and not as well-studied as the other three disorders. Additionally, it is often diagnosed through clinical evaluation rather than genetic testing.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following disorders does not show X-linked inheritance? Choices: a) Duchenne muscular dystrophy b) Tay-Sachs disease c) Haemophilia A d) Haemophilia B

"Input: Which of the following diagnostic techniques is of no value for the diagnosis of neural tube defects? Choices: a) Amniocentesis b) Chorion villus sampling (CVS) c) Maternal serum screening d) Ultrasonography 
Output:
First, I need to understand what neural tube defects are. Neural tube defects are birth defects of the brain, spine, or spinal cord. They happen in the first month of pregnancy, often before a woman even knows that she is pregnant.
Next, I need to consider the diagnostic techniques listed. Amniocentesis (a) is a procedure in which a small amount of amniotic fluid is removed from the amniotic sac surrounding the fetus. This fluid can be tested for neural tube defects. Chorion villus sampling (CVS) (b) is a procedure in which a small sample of the placenta is removed and tested for genetic disorders, including neural tube defects. Maternal serum screening (c) is a blood test that measures the levels of certain substances in the mother's blood, which can indicate the risk of neural tube defects. Ultrasonography (d) is an imaging test that uses sound waves to create images of the fetus, which can help diagnose neural tube defects.
Now, I need to determine which of these techniques is of no value for the diagnosis of neural tube defects. Based on the information above, all of the techniques listed can be used to diagnose neural tube defects.
However, I need to carefully read the question again. It asks which technique is of no value for the diagnosis of neural tube defects. This means I need to find a technique that is not used to diagnose neural tube defects.
Upon re-reading the question, I realize that I made a mistake. Actually, all the techniques listed can be used to diagnose neural tube defects. Therefore, the question is flawed, and there is no correct answer.

"Input: Which of the following conditions is a peroxisomal disorder? Choices: a) Acute intermittent porphyria b) Maple syrup urine disease c) Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency d) Zellweger syndrome 
Output:
First, I need to identify what a peroxisomal disorder is. Peroxisomal disorders are a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the function of peroxisomes, which are organelles found in cells that are involved in the breakdown of fatty acids and amino acids.
Next, I need to examine each option to see which one is a peroxisomal disorder. Acute intermittent porphyria is a disorder of heme biosynthesis, so it is not a peroxisomal disorder. Maple syrup urine disease is a disorder of amino acid metabolism, so it is not a peroxisomal disorder. Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is a disorder of fatty acid oxidation, but it is not a peroxisomal disorder. Zellweger syndrome is a disorder of peroxisome biogenesis, so it is a peroxisomal disorder.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Marked microsatellite instability is a feature of: Choices: a) familial adenomatous polyposis. b) hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC). c) multiple endocrine adenomatosis type 2. d) neurofibromatosis 1. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the condition associated with microsatellite instability. Microsatellite instability is a condition where there is a high frequency of mutations in microsatellites, which are short sequences of DNA that repeat.
Next, I need to consider the characteristics of each option. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a condition characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of polyps in the colon and rectum, but it is not typically associated with microsatellite instability.
Hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome, is a condition that increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer and is characterized by microsatellite instability.
Multiple endocrine adenomatosis type 2 (MEN2) is a condition that affects the endocrine system and is not typically associated with microsatellite instability.
Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a condition that affects the nervous system and is not typically associated with microsatellite instability.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: The common mutation in α-thalassaemia consists of: Choices: a) a deletion. b) a duplication. c) an insertion. d) a point mutation. 
Output:
First, I need to understand what α-thalassaemia is. α-thalassaemia is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the HBA1/2 genes, which code for the alpha-globin chains of hemoglobin.
Next, I need to know what the common mutation in α-thalassaemia is. The common mutation in α-thalassaemia is a deletion of three nucleotides in the HBA1/2 genes, which leads to the production of a truncated alpha-globin chain.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A baby born with pulmonary hypoplasia secondary to oligohydramnios caused by renal agenesis would be classified as having: Choices: a) an association. b) a dysplasia. c) a sequence. d) a syndrome. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the terms. An association refers to a condition that occurs when two or more genetic or environmental factors combine to cause a particular condition. A dysplasia refers to an abnormal development of cells or tissues. A sequence refers to a series of events that occur in a specific order, often resulting in a particular condition. A syndrome refers to a group of symptoms that occur together, often caused by a single underlying condition.
Next, I need to analyze the given condition. The baby was born with pulmonary hypoplasia, which is a condition where the lungs do not develop properly. This is caused by oligohydramnios, which is a condition where there is a lack of amniotic fluid. The oligohydramnios is caused by renal agenesis, which is the absence of one or both kidneys.
Now, I need to determine the classification. The condition is a series of events that occur in a specific order, resulting in a particular condition. Therefore, the correct classification is a sequence.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

"Input: Which of the following trisomy karyotypes has the mildest effect on human development? Choices: a) 47,XXX b) 47,XXY c) 47,XX,+13 d) 47,XY,+21 
Output:
First, I need to understand what each option represents. A trisomy is a condition where there is an extra chromosome in a cell. The numbers represent the total number of chromosomes in a cell, and the letters represent the sex chromosomes (X and Y).
Next, I need to consider the effects of each trisomy on human development. A trisomy of 47,XXX is a condition where a female has an extra X chromosome. This condition is often referred to as Triple X syndrome and can result in physical and developmental delays, but it is generally considered to be a milder condition compared to other trisomies.
A trisomy of 47,XXY is a condition where a male has an extra X chromosome. This condition is often referred to as Klinefelter syndrome and can result in physical and developmental delays, as well as infertility.
A trisomy of 47,XX,+13 is a condition where a child has an extra chromosome 13. This condition is often referred to as Patau syndrome and can result in severe physical and developmental delays, as well as a high risk of death in infancy.
A trisomy of 47,XY,+21 is a condition where a child has an extra chromosome 21. This condition is often referred to as Down syndrome and can result in significant physical and developmental delays, as well as a range of health problems.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Mutations that cause achondroplasia exert an effect which can be classified as: Choices: a) dominant negative. b) gain-of-function. c) haploinsufficiency. d) loss-of-function. 
Output:
First, I need to understand what achondroplasia is. Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder that affects bone growth and is the most common form of short-limbed dwarfism.
Next, I need to understand the types of mutations that can cause genetic disorders. There are four main types of mutations: gain-of-function, loss-of-function, dominant negative, and haploinsufficiency.
Now, I need to determine which type of mutation causes achondroplasia. Achondroplasia is caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene, which codes for a protein that regulates bone growth. The mutation leads to the production of a protein that is overactive, causing excessive bone growth to be inhibited.
Therefore, the mutation that causes achondroplasia is a gain-of-function mutation, as it leads to an overactive protein that causes the disease.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: The presence of two or more cell lines from different zygotes in a single individual is known as: Choices: a) mosaicism. b) diploidy. c) aneuploidy. d) chimaerism. 
Output:
First, I need to understand what each term means. Mosaicism refers to the presence of two or more cell lines from the same zygote, but with different genetic makeup. Diploidy refers to the presence of two sets of chromosomes in a cell, which is normal in most eukaryotic organisms. Aneuploidy refers to the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell. Chimaerism refers to the presence of two or more cell lines from different zygotes in a single individual.
Now, I need to apply this understanding to the question. The question asks about the presence of two or more cell lines from different zygotes in a single individual, which matches the definition of chimaerism.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The risk for miscarriage associated with amniocentesis is approximately ____. Choices: a) 1 in 10 b) 1 in 50 c) 1 in 100 to 1 in 200 d) 1 in 1000 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the question. Amniocentesis is a prenatal test that involves withdrawing a sample of amniotic fluid to diagnose genetic disorders.
Next, I need to recall the general risks associated with amniocentesis. The risk of miscarriage is a well-known complication of the procedure.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. The correct answer is not a) 1 in 10, as this is too high. The correct answer is not b) 1 in 50, as this is also too high. The correct answer is not d) 1 in 1000, as this is too low. The correct answer is c) 1 in 100 to 1 in 200, as this is the generally accepted risk.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Autozygosity mapping is used to map disorders that show which pattern of inheritance? Choices: a) Autosomal dominant b) Autosomal recessive c) X-linked dominant d) X-linked recessive 
Output:
First, I need to understand what autozygosity mapping is. Autozygosity mapping is a technique used to identify the genetic basis of disorders that are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.
Next, I need to consider the characteristics of autosomal recessive disorders. Autosomal recessive disorders are caused by mutations in genes that are located on the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) and are inherited in a recessive manner, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the disorder.
Now, I need to compare the options. Autosomal dominant disorders are caused by mutations in genes that are located on the autosomes and are inherited in a dominant manner, meaning that an individual only needs to inherit one copy of the mutated gene to express the disorder. X-linked dominant disorders are caused by mutations in genes that are located on the X chromosome and are inherited in a dominant manner. X-linked recessive disorders are caused by mutations in genes that are located on the X chromosome and are inherited in a recessive manner.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Consanguinity shows a strong association with which pattern of inheritance? Choices: a) Autosomal dominant b) Autosomal recessive c) X-linked dominant d) X-linked recessive 
Output:
First, I need to understand what consanguinity is. Consanguinity refers to the relationship between individuals who share a common ancestor, often resulting in a higher likelihood of genetic disorders due to the increased chance of inheriting identical or similar genetic material.
Next, I need to consider the patterns of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that a single copy of the dominant allele is enough to cause the condition, and it can be inherited from either parent. Autosomal recessive inheritance requires two copies of the recessive allele to express the condition, and it can be inherited from either parent. X-linked dominant and recessive inheritance involve genes located on the X chromosome and are more complex.
Now, I need to consider the relationship between consanguinity and the patterns of inheritance. Consanguinity increases the likelihood of inheriting identical or similar genetic material, which is more likely to occur with autosomal recessive inheritance. This is because consanguinity increases the chance of inheriting identical or similar genetic material from both parents, which can lead to the expression of recessive conditions.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Most new mutations appear to be Choices: a) beneficial b) neutral or deleterious c) present in homozygotes rather than heterozygotes d) detectable using allozyme studies (protein electrophoresis) 
Output:
First, I need to understand what each option means. 
Beneficial mutations are those that increase the fitness of an organism, making it more likely to survive and reproduce. 
Neutral mutations are those that have no effect on the fitness of an organism. 
Deleterious mutations are those that decrease the fitness of an organism, making it less likely to survive and reproduce. 
Homozygotes are organisms that have two copies of the same allele, while heterozygotes have one copy of each allele. 
Allozyme studies, also known as protein electrophoresis, are a type of genetic analysis that can detect differences in protein structure.
Now, I need to consider the context of the question. The question asks about the majority of new mutations, so I need to think about what is most common.
Most new mutations are neutral, as they do not provide a significant advantage or disadvantage to the organism. 
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Twin studies in humans are useful because Choices: a) they allow genetic as opposed to environmental influences on variation in a trait to be estimated b) cloning of genes is facilitated by the presence of extra copies c) they allow improved expression of genes d) twins have a greater likelihood of being heterozygous 
Output:
First, I need to understand what twin studies are useful for. Twin studies are used to determine the role of genetics versus environment in the variation of a trait.
Next, I need to consider the options. Option a) they allow genetic as opposed to environmental influences on variation in a trait to be estimated, seems to be the most relevant to twin studies.
Option b) cloning of genes is facilitated by the presence of extra copies, is not directly related to twin studies.
Option c) they allow improved expression of genes, is also not directly related to twin studies.
Option d) twins have a greater likelihood of being heterozygous, is not necessarily true and is not the main purpose of twin studies.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Complete the following sentence. The Philadelphia chromosome: Choices: a) is an example of gene amplification. b) is a product of a reciprocal translocation. c) causes Burkitt's lymphoma. d) causes retinoblastoma. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the correct definition of the Philadelphia chromosome. The Philadelphia chromosome is a product of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22.
Next, I need to eliminate the incorrect options. Gene amplification is the process by which a gene is copied multiple times, which is not related to the Philadelphia chromosome. Burkitt's lymphoma is a type of cancer that is caused by a different genetic abnormality, and retinoblastoma is a type of eye cancer that is caused by a mutation in the RB1 gene.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Enzyme assay can be used to identify carriers of: Choices: a) Cystic fibrosis. b) Fragile X syndrome. c) Oculocutaneous albinism. d) Tay-Sachs disease. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the type of genetic disorder that can be identified through an enzyme assay. Enzyme assays are used to identify genetic disorders that result from enzyme deficiencies.
Next, I need to consider the options and determine which one is a genetic disorder that results from an enzyme deficiency. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that results from a deficiency in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which is an enzyme.
Now, I need to eliminate the other options. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene, not an enzyme deficiency. Oculocutaneous albinism is a group of genetic disorders caused by mutations in various genes, not enzyme deficiencies. Tay-Sachs disease is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the HEXA gene, which codes for an enzyme, but it is not typically identified through an enzyme assay.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: A high blood ammonia level occurs in: Choices: a) galactosaemia. b) Hurler's syndrome. c) ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. d) phenylketonuria. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the condition that is associated with a high blood ammonia level. 
Galactosaemia is a condition where the body is unable to break down galactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. It is not typically associated with high blood ammonia levels.
Hurler's syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase, which breaks down sugar molecules. It is not typically associated with high blood ammonia levels.
Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the urea cycle, which is responsible for removing ammonia from the body. A deficiency in OTC can lead to high blood ammonia levels.
Phenylketonuria is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which breaks down the amino acid phenylalanine. It is not typically associated with high blood ammonia levels.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: In genome-wide association studies, known SNPs explain ______ of the variation in body mass index despite the evidence of greater than 50% heritability from twin and family studies. Choices: a) only 5% b) less than 1% c) only 13% d) less than 2% 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the question. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are used to identify genetic variants associated with complex traits, such as body mass index (BMI).
Next, I need to recall the results of GWAS for BMI. GWAS have identified many genetic variants associated with BMI, but these variants explain only a small proportion of the variation in BMI.
According to a study published in the journal Nature, known SNPs explain only about 13% of the variation in BMI, despite the evidence of greater than 50% heritability from twin and family studies.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Differential distribution of substances in the egg most typically results in: Choices: a) differences in gene expression which may establish a pattern in the embryo as the cells divide b) amplification of specific genes during development c) development of polyploid tissues d) loss of specific genes during development 
Output:
First, I need to understand the concept of differential distribution of substances in the egg. This refers to the uneven distribution of molecules, such as proteins and RNAs, within the egg cell.
Next, I need to consider how this uneven distribution affects the development of the embryo. The differential distribution of substances can influence the expression of genes, which in turn can establish a pattern in the embryo as the cells divide.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) differences in gene expression which may establish a pattern in the embryo as the cells divide is the most plausible outcome of differential distribution of substances in the egg.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: Which of the following conditions is not caused by a mutation in FGFR3? Choices: a) Achondroplasia b) Crouzon syndrome c) Thanatophoric dysplasia d) Waardenburg syndrome 
Output:
First, I need to identify the conditions that are known to be caused by mutations in FGFR3. Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder that affects bone growth and is caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene. Crouzon syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the development of the skull and face and is also caused by a mutation in the FGFR2 gene, not FGFR3. Thanatophoric dysplasia is a genetic disorder that affects bone growth and is caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene. Waardenburg syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the development of the eyes, hair, and skin and is caused by mutations in the PAX3 gene, not FGFR3.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
