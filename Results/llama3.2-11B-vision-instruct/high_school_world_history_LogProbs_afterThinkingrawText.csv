answer
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
No task is more urgent than that of preserving peace. Without peace our independence means little. The rehabilitation and upbuilding of our countries will have little meaning. Our revolutions will not be allowed to run their course. What can we do? We can do much! We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we! We, the peoples of Asia and Africa, 1.4 billion strong.
Indonesian leader Sukarno, keynote address to the Bandung Conference, 1955
The passage above is most associated with which of the following developments? Choices: a) The formation of the non-aligned movement b) Global disarmanent and nuclear non-proliferation c) The Green Revolution in agriculture d) Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements of the passage. The passage mentions the importance of preserving peace, the need for the voice of reason in world affairs, and the mobilization of the spiritual, moral, and political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the passage. The passage was delivered by Indonesian leader Sukarno in 1955 at the Bandung Conference, which was attended by representatives from 29 countries from Asia and Africa.
Now, I need to analyze the options. Option a) The formation of the non-aligned movement is a plausible answer, as the passage mentions the mobilization of the spiritual, moral, and political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace, which aligns with the principles of the non-aligned movement. Option b) Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation is not directly mentioned in the passage, so it is less likely to be the correct answer. Option c) The Green Revolution in agriculture is not mentioned at all in the passage, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer. Option d) Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology is not the main focus of the passage, which emphasizes the importance of peace and the mobilization of the spiritual, moral, and political strength of Asia and Africa, rather than a specific ideology.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China
In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
The argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history? Choices: a) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other b) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era c) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E. d) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main argument of the passage. The passage discusses the development of gunpowder weapons in Europe and China during the 1200s through the 1400s. It highlights the different approaches taken by the two regions in developing these weapons, with Europe focusing on improving gunpowder technology and China focusing on improving horse archer units.
Next, I need to consider the large-scale questions about global history that are listed in the choices. I need to think about which question is most closely related to the main argument of the passage.
The passage does not discuss the sharing of strategically important technologies between societies, so choice a is not relevant. The passage does discuss the development of gunpowder weapons in Europe and China, but it does not provide a clear explanation for why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era, so choice b is not directly relevant. The passage does not discuss the decline of Silk Road commerce, so choice c is not relevant. The passage does discuss the development of gunpowder weapons in Europe and China, but it does not provide a clear explanation for how the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion, so choice d is not relevant.
The passage most closely relates to the question of why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era. This is because the passage discusses the development of gunpowder weapons in Europe and China, and it highlights the different approaches taken by the two regions in developing these weapons. This is relevant to the question of why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era because it suggests that the development of gunpowder weapons in Europe was an important factor in this process.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
The city of Ghana consists of two towns. One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables.... The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means.... The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms.... He sits... in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols.... On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals.... The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani.

What evidence is there in the passage that Ghanians were engaged, directly or indirectly, in trade with Asia? Choices: a) They kept horses in their court, which would have come from the Mongols. b) The Ghanian king had adopted the Chinese tradition of the kow-tow. c) The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India. d) The people in his court wore silk robes. 
Output:
First, I need to look for any information in the passage that suggests trade with Asia. The passage mentions that the king levies a tax on salt, copper, and other goods, which suggests that these goods are being imported into the country.
Next, I need to consider the origin of these goods. The passage does not mention the origin of the salt, copper, or other goods, but it does mention that the king levies a tax on them. This suggests that these goods are being imported from outside the country.
Now, I need to consider the possibility of trade with Asia. The passage does not mention any specific countries or regions that the goods are coming from, but it does mention that the king levies a tax on them. This suggests that the goods are being imported from a region that is not the king's own country.
The passage does mention that the people in the king's court wear silk robes, which is a type of fabric that is commonly associated with Asia. This suggests that there may be trade between the king's country and Asia.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

Indonesian leader Sukarno, keynote address to the Bandung Conference, 1955
Like numerous other leaders in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, Sukarno attempted, but did not completely succeed, in maintaining a neutral stance during Choices: a) the Arab-Israeli conflict. b) the Korean War. c) the Cold War. d) the Vietnam conflicts. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the time period in which Sukarno delivered the keynote address. The address was delivered in 1955.
Next, I need to consider the major conflicts that occurred during the 1950s. The Korean War occurred from 1950 to 1953, and the Vietnam conflicts began in the 1950s but escalated in the 1960s.
The Arab-Israeli conflict has been ongoing since the 1940s, but it was not as prominent in the 1950s as it was in the 1960s and 1970s.
The Cold War was ongoing throughout the 1950s, but it was not a conflict in the classical sense.
Considering the time period and the nature of the conflicts, I believe that Sukarno's attempt to maintain a neutral stance was most relevant to the Cold War.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them.... He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.
â€”Adapted from U.S. Army Lt. Paul C. McGrath's account of Colonel Bonesteel's decision in the 1940s
How did the events depicted here affect Koreans? Choices: a) They became a part of Japanâ€™s territory. b) The Americans established freedom for all Koreans. c) The Korean economy never recovered. d) Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the events. The events depicted refer to the decision made by Colonel Bonesteel to establish a surrender zone in Korea during the 1940s.
Next, I need to consider the impact of these events on Koreans. The events led to the division of Korea into two zones, with the 38th parallel serving as the hypothetical line dividing the zones.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices. Choice a) is incorrect because Korea was not a part of Japan's territory at the time. Choice b) is also incorrect because the events did not establish freedom for all Koreans. Choice c) is not supported by the information provided. Choice d) is the correct answer because the events led to the division of Korea into two nations near the 38th parallel.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

Both authors below were speaking of the French Revolution.
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other wayâ€”in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal... that things in general were settled for ever.

Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive. But to be young was very heaven.
â€”The Prelude, by William Wordsworth
Dickens's and Wordsworth's differing views about the French Revolution can be described, respectively, by which of the following adjectives? Choices: a) Optimistic, encouraged b) Understanding, accepting c) Cynical, enthusiastic d) Sincere, resigned 
Output:
First, I need to identify the tone of Dickens's passage. Dickens describes the French Revolution as a time of contradictions, with both positive and negative aspects. He uses phrases such as ""the best of times, the worst of times"" and ""the season of Light, the season of Darkness"" to convey this sense of ambiguity. Dickens's tone is therefore more cynical, as he is skeptical of the idea that the French Revolution was a straightforwardly positive or negative event.
Next, I need to identify the tone of Wordsworth's passage. Wordsworth describes the French Revolution as a time of great joy and optimism, using phrases such as ""Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive"" and ""But to be young was very heaven."" His tone is therefore more enthusiastic, as he is clearly excited and inspired by the events of the French Revolution.
Finally, I need to compare the two tones and choose the correct answer. Dickens's tone is cynical, while Wordsworth's tone is enthusiastic. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
Woman, wake up; the bell of reason is being heard throughout the whole universe; discover your rights. Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!
Olympe de Gouges, ""Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,"" 1791
The independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fearâ€”but apart from that, nothing has changed.
Halima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence
Which of the following observations about revolutions and gender is best supported by the first passage? Choices: a) Revolutionary progressivism does not always concern itself with gender equality. b) Women typically assume leadership roles during times of revolution. c) Women rarely support revolutions and therefore receive little benefit from them. d) Revolutionary movements are generally uninterested in women's rights. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the content of the passage. The passage is a call to action for women to recognize their rights and to oppose the empty pretentions of superiority of their leaders. The passage argues that women have not received any advantage from the Revolution, but rather a more pronounced scorn and disdain.
Next, I need to consider the tone and language used in the passage. The tone is one of urgency and frustration, and the language is direct and confrontational. The passage is written in a style that is typical of revolutionary rhetoric, with a focus on the need for action and the importance of challenging the status quo.
Now, I need to evaluate the options based on the analysis. Option a) is supported by the passage, as it argues that revolutionary progressivism does not always concern itself with gender equality. Option b) is not supported, as there is no indication that women are assuming leadership roles during the Revolution. Option c) is not supported, as the passage argues that women are actively supporting the Revolution and demanding their rights. Option d) is not supported, as the passage argues that revolutionary movements should be interested in women's rights.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

""The question as to who, and what, is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels. Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.""
Walter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974
Which of the following best explains the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.? Choices: a) Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs. b) Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms. c) Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves. d) Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the correct answer based on the information provided by Walter Rodney. He states that the capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.
Next, I need to consider the options provided and determine which one aligns with Rodney's statement. Option b) Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms, seems to be the most relevant to the statement. Rodney implies that the Europeans exploited Africa, and trading for firearms would have allowed African states to consolidate power and potentially resist European exploitation.
Now, I need to evaluate the other options. Option a) is incorrect because there is no mention of New World foodstuffs in the provided text. Option c) is also incorrect because the text does not mention the sale of slaves. Option d) is incorrect because the text does not mention Muslim and Arab merchant princes.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

""It is impossible to demand that an impossible position should be cleared up by peaceful revision and at the same time constantly reject peaceful revision. It is also impossible to say that he who undertakes to carry out these revisions for himself transgresses a law, since the Versailles ""Diktat"" is not law to us. A signature was forced out of us with pistols at our head and with the threat of hunger for millions of people. And then this document, with our signature, obtained by force, was proclaimed as a solemn law.""

Winston Churchill, speech before Parliament, June 4, 1940
What is the historical background for Adolf Hitler's condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles mentioned in Source 1? Choices: a) Hitler's belief that Poland's territorial borders should not be violated b) A rising intolerance of ethnic and political minority groups c) A widespread belief in Germany that it had been unfairly treated at the end of World War I d) Hitler's attempted collaboration with Italian leader Benito Mussolini 
Output:
First, I need to identify the historical context of the Treaty of Versailles. The Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919, after World War I, and imposed harsh penalties on Germany, including significant territorial losses and reparations.
Next, I need to consider the sentiment expressed by Adolf Hitler in Source 1. Hitler is expressing his opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, stating that it was forced upon Germany and is therefore not a legitimate law.
Now, I need to analyze the historical background that would lead to Hitler's condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles. The widespread belief in Germany that it had been unfairly treated at the end of World War I is a key factor. Many Germans felt that the Treaty of Versailles was too harsh and that it had been imposed upon them without their consent.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race â€” by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.
British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860
Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.
Rudrangshu Mukherjee, ""The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,"" 1990
According to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre Choices: a) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms. b) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India. c) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression. d) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the Cawnpore Massacre. The passage describes it as a violent event where black men killed their white masters, as well as helpless ladies and children.
Next, I need to analyze the reasons behind the massacre. The passage mentions that it was a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, where the native chiefs and people wanted to shake off the yoke of a stranger and re-establish their power.
Now, I need to consider the perspective of the British and the Indians. The passage highlights that the British had a monopoly of violence, and the Indians were treated as animals, denied their ""humanness"" due to their skin color and birth.
Based on this analysis, I can conclude that the correct answer is the one that acknowledges the systemic violence and oppression faced by the Indians under British rule. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

The passage below is taken from testimony before Parliament.
Joshua Drake, called in; and Examined.
You say you would prefer moderate labour and lower wages; are you pretty comfortable upon your present wages?
â€”I have no wages, but two days a week at present; but when I am working at some jobs we can make a little, and at others we do very poorly.
When a child gets 3s. a week, does that go much towards its subsistence?
â€”No, it will not keep it as it should do.
Why do you allow your children to go to work at those places where they are ill-treated or over-worked?
â€”Necessity compels a man that has children to let them work.
Then you would not allow your children to go to those factories under the present system, if it was not from necessity?
â€”No.
â€”Testimony given before the Sadler Committee, 1831â€“32
According to the passage, why does the witness allow his children to work in a place where they will be ill-treated? Choices: a) A factory owner is forcing him to do so. b) He doesnâ€™t earn enough on his own. c) The children need discipline. d) Their labor is only moderately difficult. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the reason why the witness allows his children to work in a place where they will be ill-treated. The passage states that the witness says, ""Necessity compels a man that has children to let them work.""
Next, I need to understand what the witness means by ""necessity."" The passage continues, ""When a child gets 3s. a week, does that go much towards its subsistence? â€”No, it will not keep it as it should do."" This suggests that the witness is struggling to provide for his children and that their labor is necessary to supplement their income.
Finally, I need to consider the other options. Option a) is not supported by the passage, as there is no mention of a factory owner forcing the witness to allow his children to work. Option c) is also not supported, as the passage does not mention discipline as a reason for the witness's decision. Option d) is incorrect, as the passage states that the children are ""ill-treated"" and that their labor is ""only moderately difficult"" is not the reason.

Which best describes the relationship between the United States and the Soviets as depicted in the passage? Choices: a) Uneasy allies b) Comrades-in-arms c) Mortal enemies d) Distant strangers 
Output:
First, I need to identify the tone of the passage. The passage describes the situation as a ""problem"" and mentions that the United States would be ""unable to stop"" the Soviets if they refused to accept the surrender arrangement. This suggests a sense of tension and competition between the two nations.
Next, I need to consider the context of the passage. The passage is discussing a military strategy and the need to establish a surrender zone to prevent the Soviets from seizing all of Korea. This suggests that the relationship between the United States and the Soviets is one of rivalry and competition.
Finally, I need to evaluate the language used in the passage. The passage describes the Soviets as a potential threat and mentions that the United States would be ""unable to stop"" them if they refused to accept the surrender arrangement. This language suggests a sense of hostility and mistrust.

Letter from a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War, South Africa, 1879
Incidents such as those described by the author of the letter were used by the British government to do which of the following? Choices: a) Issue a casus belli to go to war with the Kingdom of Zulu b) Tax the Zulu kingdom to cover damages attributed to them c) Sever its responsibility to protect citizens who chose to live in South Africa d) Liberate the Zulus from British colonialism 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the letter. The letter is written by a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War in South Africa in 1879.
Next, I need to identify the purpose of the letter. The letter describes the destruction of the writer's property by a contingent of 1,500 natives, which is likely referring to the Zulu people.
Now, I need to analyze the options. Option a) Issue a casus belli to go to war with the Kingdom of Zulu is a plausible reason for the British government to use incidents like the one described in the letter. The letter describes the destruction of property and the writer is suing the government for damages, which could be used as a pretext for war. Option b) Tax the Zulu kingdom to cover damages attributed to them is also a possible reason, as the British government might use the damages as a justification to impose taxes on the Zulu kingdom. Option c) Sever its responsibility to protect citizens who chose to live in South Africa is not a likely reason, as the British government would likely want to protect its citizens, not abandon them. Option d) Liberate the Zulus from British colonialism is the opposite of what the British government would want to do, so it is not a plausible reason.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

""The greatest contribution that Africa can make to the peace of the world is to avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity, by creating a political union which will also by its success, stand as an example to a divided world. A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.""
Kwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961
Nkrumah's argument in the passage most clearly supports which of the following ideologies? Choices: a) Pan-Africanism b) Communism c) African socialism d) Neocolonialism 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of Nkrumah's argument. He is advocating for a political union of African states to promote peace and unity in the world.
Next, I need to consider the ideologies listed in the choices. Pan-Africanism is a movement that aims to promote unity and solidarity among African people and nations. This aligns with Nkrumah's argument for a political union of African states.
Communism is an ideology that emphasizes class struggle and the abolition of private property. This does not align with Nkrumah's argument.
African socialism is an ideology that combines elements of socialism and African culture. While Nkrumah was a socialist, his argument in the passage is more focused on unity and independence than on economic systems.
Neocolonialism is an ideology that supports the continuation of colonialism in new forms. This is the opposite of Nkrumah's argument, which advocates for African independence.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.""

Which of the following best explains Mao's concept of the ""socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture"" in China? Choices: a) Agriculture fueled industrialization in cities as excess labor flowed from the countryside to urban centers. b) Agricultural surpluses allowed the state to invest more heavily in modernizing agricultural production. c) Agricultural efficiency reduced prices of basic commodities, raising the standard of living across the whole of China. d) Agriculture was collectivized, with the result that entire communities shared fields instead of individuals owning the land as private property. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. Mao Zedong is discussing the issue of polarization in the countryside, where some peasants are becoming rich while others are struggling to make ends meet. He is arguing that the current situation is unsustainable and that a new approach is needed to address this problem.
Next, I need to identify the key concept that Mao is proposing as a solution to this problem. He mentions the ""socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture,"" which he describes as a process of bringing about co-operation and eliminating the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside.
Now, I need to analyze the options to determine which one best explains Mao's concept. Option a) mentions the flow of labor from the countryside to urban centers, but this is not mentioned in the passage. Option b) mentions the state investing in modernizing agricultural production, but this is also not mentioned in the passage. Option c) mentions agricultural efficiency reducing prices of basic commodities, but this is not the main focus of the passage. Option d) mentions the collectivization of agriculture, which is the closest to the concept of ""socialist transformation"" mentioned in the passage.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

The condition of foreign states is not what it once was; they have invented the steamship, and introduced radical changes in the art of navigation. They have also built up their armies to a state of great efficiency and are possessed of war implements of great power and precision, in short have license to be formidable powers. If, therefore, we persistently cling to our antiquated systems, heaven only knows what a mighty calamity may befall our Empire.
â€”Adapted from a letter written by Lord Ii to Lord Tokugawa, 1847
Which event or period in Japan's history best reflects Lord Ii's concerns? Choices: a) The expulsion of Christian missionaries from Japan b) The adoption of Chinese imperial customs in the Japanese court c) The annexation of Manchuria by the Japanese d) Commodore Perry forcing Japan to open its ports to trade 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements in the passage that indicate the time period being referred to. The passage mentions the invention of the steamship and the introduction of radical changes in navigation, which suggests that the time period is relatively modern.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of Japan during this time period. The passage mentions the need to update antiquated systems, which suggests that Japan was facing challenges from foreign powers.
Now, I need to evaluate the options in light of this information. Option a) The expulsion of Christian missionaries from Japan is an event that occurred in the 17th century, which is too early to be related to the concerns expressed in the passage. Option b) The adoption of Chinese imperial customs in the Japanese court is an event that occurred in the 6th century, which is also too early. Option c) The annexation of Manchuria by the Japanese is an event that occurred in the 20th century, which is too late. Option d) Commodore Perry forcing Japan to open its ports to trade is an event that occurred in the mid-19th century, which matches the time period suggested by the passage.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

""The real grievance of the worker is the insecurity of his existence; he is not sure that he will always have work, he is not sure that he will always be healthy, and he foresees that he will one day be old and unfit to work. If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently.

This ruler of Syria made me spend many years as commander of his army,
Every land to which I turned
I overcame.
I destroyed its green fields and its wells,
I captured its cattle, I took captive its inhabitants, I deprived them of their provisions,
and I slew [many] peopleâ€¦by my sword, my bow, my marchings, and my good devices.
Thus my excellence was in his heart; he loved me and he knew my valor;
â€¦he set me at the head of his sons, when he saw the success of my handiwork.
There came a champion of Syria
to defy me in my tent;
a bold man without equal, for he had vanquished all his rivals.
He said, ""Let Sanehat fight with me.""
He thought to overcome me; he designed to take my cattle, thus being counseled by his tribe.
The Tale of Sanehat, Egyptian poem written during the Middle Kingdom, ca.1800 B.C.E.
The text of this passage is best seen as evidence of which of the following in Egyptian society?

"Input: This question refers to the following information.
I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on.
A soldier says simply: ""They call up more every day.
""Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
""But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.""

Based on the poem and your knowledge of history, Tang relations with western nomadic peoples and frontier peoples relied on which of the following? Choices: a) Adroit diplomacy and establishment of client relationships with bordering nomads b) The ability of the Tang emperor to project military power on the frontier in order to impose his will c) The permanent settlement of Han Chinese in frontier zones d) The payment of tribute to nomadic rulers 
Output:
First, I need to consider the historical context of the poem. The poem is set during the Tang Dynasty, which was a time of significant expansion and interaction with neighboring nomadic peoples.
Next, I need to analyze the content of the poem. The poem describes the hardships faced by soldiers stationed on the frontier, including the difficulty of collecting taxes from the local population and the constant threat of nomadic raids.
Now, I need to consider the historical context of the Tang Dynasty's relations with western nomadic peoples. The Tang Dynasty was known for its ability to project military power on the frontier, and its emperors were often able to impose their will on neighboring nomadic peoples through a combination of military force and diplomacy.
Based on this analysis, I would conclude that the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
At the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated.... The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions... a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.
â€”Robert Guisepi, 1992
The Mongol empire used which of the following to integrate its vast, geographically diverse area? Choices: a) Emphasis on trade networks b) Expansion of bureaucracy to reinforce dominance c) The use of state-sponsored religion to legitimize the government d) Expansion of an interregional canal system 
Output:
First, I need to consider the geographical diversity of the Mongol empire. The empire was vast and covered a large area, including different regions and cultures.
Next, I need to think about the ways in which the Mongol empire could have integrated such a diverse area. One option is to use trade networks, which could have facilitated the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultures between different regions.
Now, I need to consider the other options. While the expansion of bureaucracy could have helped to reinforce dominance, it may not have been enough to integrate the diverse regions of the empire. Similarly, the use of state-sponsored religion may not have been effective in integrating the diverse regions, as the Mongols were known to be tolerant of different religions. Finally, the expansion of an interregional canal system may not have been feasible or practical for the Mongol empire.
Therefore, the most likely option is that the Mongol empire used emphasis on trade networks to integrate its vast, geographically diverse area.

This great purity of the French Revolution is precisely what causes both our strength and our weakness. Our strength, because it gives to us rights of the public interest over private interests; our weakness, because it rallies all vicious men against us. We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or perish with it; now in this situation, the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror. Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible; it is therefore an emanation of virtue; it is not so much a special principle as it is a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to our country's most urgent needs.
French revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre, 1794
With which of the following threats does the speaker in the passage above seem most concerned? Choices: a) Counterrevolutionary opponents b) Foreign invaders c) Communist agitators d) Transnational corporations

Next, I need to understand the speaker's tone and concerns. The speaker, Maximilien Robespierre, is discussing the need for the government to take action against internal and external enemies of the Republic.
Now, I need to analyze the specific threats mentioned in the passage. The speaker mentions ""vicious men"" and ""enemies of the Republic,"" but does not specify what these groups are.
However, based on the historical context of the French Revolution, it is likely that the speaker is referring to counterrevolutionary opponents, who were individuals who opposed the Revolution and sought to restore the monarchy.

Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them.... He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.

Which U.S. cold war policy, developed later, is consistent with the U.S. concern over limiting how much Korean territory the Soviet Union would occupy? Choices: a) DÃ©tente b) Mutual Assured Destruction c) Dollar Diplomacy d) Containment 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the question. The question refers to a historical event in which the United States and the Soviet Union were concerned about the occupation of Korean territory.
Next, I need to identify the U.S. cold war policy that is consistent with the U.S. concern over limiting how much Korean territory the Soviet Union would occupy. The policy that is consistent with this concern is containment.
Now, I need to explain why containment is the correct answer. Containment is a policy that aims to prevent the spread of communism and limit the expansion of Soviet influence. In the context of the Korean War, containment would involve limiting the Soviet Union's occupation of Korean territory to prevent the spread of communism in the region.

""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.

What economic practice is referred to by the phrase ""his Indians"" in the quote? Choices: a) Slavery b) Indentured servitude c) The encomienda system d) The apprentice system 
Output:
First, I need to identify the context of the quote. The quote mentions a Spanish nobleman and his Indians, which suggests a relationship of power and control.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the quote. The quote is from 1972, but it refers to the time of the Spanish conquest of the Americas.
Now, I need to analyze the options. Slavery (a) is a system where people are owned and forced to work against their will. Indentured servitude (b) is a system where people are contracted to work for a set period of time in exchange for passage to a new country. The encomienda system (c) is a system where the Spanish crown granted land and labor to Spanish nobles in exchange for their loyalty and military service. The apprentice system (d) is a system where young people are trained in a trade in exchange for room and board.
Based on the context and the options, I can conclude that the phrase ""his Indians"" refers to the encomienda system, where the Spanish nobleman has control over the labor of the Indians.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

Which of the following led directly to the development of the economic system described in the journal? Choices: a) Military campaigns b) Meteorological phenomena c) Competition with European trade networks d) The presence of highly developed port cities 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements of the economic system described in the journal. The journal describes a system where merchants are the dominant economic actors, and they engage in trade with other regions, including India. The system is characterized by the presence of wealthy merchants, the presence of large ships, and the exchange of goods and money.
Next, I need to consider the historical context in which the journal was written. The journal was written by Ibn Battuta, a traveler who lived in the 14th century. During this time, the Indian Ocean trade network was a major economic system that connected the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.
Now, I need to evaluate the options and determine which one is most likely to have led directly to the development of the economic system described in the journal. Option d) The presence of highly developed port cities is the most likely answer, as the journal describes Aden as a major port city that is connected to other regions through trade. The presence of highly developed port cities would have facilitated the growth of trade and the development of the economic system described in the journal.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

While some theorists in the Middle Ages argued that the jihad was a defensive warâ€¦ most authorities held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam. The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or ""Sea of Precious Virtues,"" written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.

These two passages are best understood in the context of which of the following? Choices: a) The influence of religion on interaction between cultures b) The use of religion to justify armed violence c) The syncretic fusion of different religious traditions d) The attempt of a religious group to proselytize to those following another faith 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passages. The first passage describes the obligation of jihad and the duty of a Muslim ruler to prosecute it, implying that the use of religion is used to justify armed violence. The second passage describes the kindness and respect shown to Muslim hermits by Christians, suggesting a peaceful coexistence between cultures.
Next, I need to analyze the relationship between the two passages. The first passage emphasizes the importance of jihad and the duty of a Muslim ruler, while the second passage highlights the peaceful interactions between Muslims and Christians.
Now, I need to consider the options. Option a) The influence of religion on interaction between cultures is a possible interpretation, but it does not fully capture the complexity of the passages. Option c) The syncretic fusion of different religious traditions is not relevant to the passages, which describe distinct religious traditions. Option d) The attempt of a religious group to proselytize to those following another faith is not mentioned in the passages.

""The question as to who, and what, is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels. Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.""
Walter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974
Which of the following would best support the author's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment? Choices: a) The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations b) The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market c) The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company d) The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key claim made by the author, which is that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment.
Next, I need to consider what evidence would support this claim. The author suggests that the operation of the imperialist system, which includes the exploitation of African wealth, is responsible for African underdevelopment.
Now, I need to evaluate the options to see which one best supports the author's claim. Option a) The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations, is a clear example of the exploitation of African wealth and labor, which is consistent with the author's claim. The slave trade was a key aspect of the imperialist system, and it had a devastating impact on African societies. Therefore, this option would best support the author's assertion.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race â€” by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.
British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860
Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.
Rudrangshu Mukherjee, ""The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,"" 1990
In the short term, the events discussed in both passages led to which of the following outcomes? Choices: a) The expulsion of the British East India Company and partial home rule for India b) British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company c) Indian military success and the attainment of full independence from British authority d) The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context of the passages. Both passages describe the Cawnpore massacres and the Indian Rebellion of 1857, which was a major uprising against British rule in India.
Next, I need to analyze the tone and content of the passages. The passages describe the violence and brutality of the British rule in India and the Indian response to it. They also highlight the racial and religious tensions that led to the rebellion.
Now, I need to consider the possible outcomes of the events described in the passages. Given the context and tone of the passages, it is clear that the Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a significant challenge to British rule in India. However, the passages do not suggest that the Indians were able to achieve full independence or even partial home rule. Instead, they suggest that the British were able to maintain their control over India, albeit with some concessions.
Therefore, the most likely outcome is that the British were able to defeat the Indian rebels and impose direct rule over India. This is consistent with the historical record, which shows that the British were able to suppress the rebellion and maintain their control over India for many years.

First, I need to identify the key phrases in the passage that express expectations for women. The passage states that a woman should ""rise early to duties,"" ""not refuse to perform domestic duties,"" and ""serve her husband."" These phrases suggest that women are expected to fulfill their obligations within the home and serve their husbands.
Next, I need to consider the other options. The passage does not mention women collaborating with their husbands on domestic tasks, pursuing education, or speaking their minds boldly. In fact, the passage advises women to ""love not gossip and silly laughter,"" which suggests that women should not engage in frivolous or outspoken behavior.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

The following poem refers to an incident in Sharpeville, South Africa, in 1960. To protest the requirement that they carry papers documenting their identity and residence, black South Africans gathered in front of police stations without their papers. Though other protests ended peacefully, in Sharpeville, police fired into the crowd.
What is important

is not that seventy died:
nor even that they were shot in the back
retreating, unarmed, defenceless
and certainty not

bullet-in-the-back day
Because it epitomized oppression

More clearly than anything else;
it was the classic event
Nowhere is racial dominance

the blood the rich lust after
South Africa spills dust

The discriminatory system referred to in the poem was known as Choices: a) Jim Crow. b) spheres of influence. c) Boer division. d) apartheid. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key terms in the poem that refer to the discriminatory system. The poem mentions ""apartheid"" explicitly, which is a term that refers to a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination.
Next, I need to understand the context in which the term ""apartheid"" is used in the poem. The poem describes the Sharpeville incident as an example of the oppressive nature of apartheid, highlighting the brutal treatment of black South Africans by the police.
Now, I need to consider the other options and determine if they are relevant to the context of the poem. Jim Crow refers to a system of racial segregation in the United States, spheres of influence refers to a concept in international relations, and Boer division refers to a historical conflict in South Africa. None of these options are relevant to the context of the poem.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

Both authors below were speaking of the French Revolution.
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other wayâ€”in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal... that things in general were settled for ever.

The intellectual foundations of the eighteenth-century political revolutions were based on Choices: a) the Reformation b) mercantilism c) the Enlightenment d) the Reconquista 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key phrases that indicate the time period being referred to. The phrases ""the French Revolution"" and ""the eighteenth-century political revolutions"" suggest that the correct answer is related to this time period.
Next, I need to consider the options provided and determine which one is most closely associated with the intellectual foundations of the eighteenth-century political revolutions. The Reformation, mercantilism, and the Reconquista are all historical events, but they are not directly related to the intellectual foundations of the French Revolution.
The Enlightenment, on the other hand, is a historical period that emphasized reason, individualism, and democracy, which are all key concepts that influenced the French Revolution. Therefore, the correct answer is the Enlightenment.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

While some theorists in the Middle Ages argued that the jihad was a defensive warâ€¦ most authorities held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam. The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or ""Sea of Precious Virtues,"" written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.
Robert Irwin, ""Islam and the Crusades,"" 1995
It is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them. Likewise, not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories.
Ibn Jubayr, Muslim scholar, traveling to Mecca and Jerusalem, ca. 1185
The first passage tends to support which of the following traditional historical assumptions? Choices: a) That the majority of Muslims were more peaceful than Christians during the crusading era b) That most Muslims were interested only in protecting their own territory during the crusading era c) That many Muslims during the crusading era were driven by Islamic faith to be inherently violent d) That the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of the first passage. The passage states that most authorities in the Middle Ages held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam, and that a Muslim ruler who did not prosecute the jihad was considered corrupt.
Next, I need to consider the implications of this idea. The idea suggests that the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era, and that they believed it was their duty to spread Islam and bring about the victory of Islam.
Now, I need to compare this idea with the options. Option d) That the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era is the only option that aligns with the main idea of the passage.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

""From the confines of Jerusalem and the city of Constantinople a horrible tale has gone forth and very frequently has been brought to our ears, namely, that a race from the kingdom of the Persians, an accursed race, a race utterly alienated from God, a generation forsooth which has not directed its heart and has not entrusted its spirit to God, has invaded the lands of those Christians and has depopulated them by the sword, pillage and fire; it has led away a part of the captives into its own country, and a part it has destroyed by cruel tortures; it has either entirely destroyed the churches of God or appropriated them for the rites of its own religionâ€¦.The kingdom of the Greeks is now dismembered by them and deprived of territory so vast in extent that it cannot be traversed in a march of two months. On whom therefore is the labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering this territory incumbent, if not upon you? You, upon whom above other nations God has conferred remarkable glory in arms, great courage, bodily activity, and strength to humble the hairy scalp of those who resist you.
Let the deeds of your ancestors move you and incite your minds to manly achievements; the glory and greatness of king Charles the Great, and of his son Louis, and of your other kings, who have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans, and extended in these lands the territory of the holy church. Let the holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior, which is possessed by unclean nations, especially incite you, and the holy places which are now treated with ignominy and irreverently polluted with their filthiness. Oh, most valiant soldiers and descendants of invincible ancestors, be not degenerate, but recall the valor of your progenitors.
Jerusalem is the navel of the world; the land is fruitful above others, like another paradise of delights. This the Redeemer of the human race has made illustrious by His advent, has beautified by residence, has consecrated by suffering, has redeemed by death, has glorified by burial. This royal city, therefore, situated at the center of the world, is now held captive by His enemies, and is in subjection to those who do not know God, to the worship of the heathens. She seeks therefore and desires to be liberated and does not cease to implore you to come to her aid. From you especially she asks succor, because, as we have already said, God has conferred upon you above all nations great glory in arms.

Pope Urban II, Speech at the Council of Clermont as recorded by Robert the Monk, 1095 C.E.
Which of the following events most directly inspired Urban's invocation of Constantinople in the first paragraph? Choices: a) The conquest of Constantinople by the armies of the Abbasid Caliphate b) The invasion of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks c) The invasion of the Balkans by the Avars and Bulgars d) The conversion of the people of Constantinople to Catholic Christianity 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements in the first paragraph of the speech. The paragraph mentions that a race from the kingdom of the Persians has invaded the lands of Christians, depopulated them, and destroyed churches. It also mentions that the kingdom of the Greeks is now dismembered and deprived of territory.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the speech. The speech was given in 1095 C.E. by Pope Urban II at the Council of Clermont.
Now, I need to evaluate the options in light of the historical context. Option a) The conquest of Constantinople by the armies of the Abbasid Caliphate is not relevant to the speech, as the Abbasid Caliphate was a Muslim empire that did not have a significant presence in the region at the time. Option d) The conversion of the people of Constantinople to Catholic Christianity is also not relevant, as the speech is concerned with the invasion of Christian lands by a Muslim army, not with the conversion of people to Christianity.
Option c) The invasion of the Balkans by the Avars and Bulgars is not directly relevant to the speech, as the speech specifically mentions the kingdom of the Greeks and the city of Constantinople.
Option b) The invasion of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks is the most likely event to have inspired Urban's invocation of Constantinople in the first paragraph. The Seljuk Turks had recently invaded Anatolia, which is a region in modern-day Turkey, and had captured the city of Nicaea, which is near Constantinople. This event would have been a significant threat to the Byzantine Empire and would have inspired Urban to call for a crusade to defend Christian lands.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!
What's this that you have done?
Is 't not a very naughty thing
To snatch the kaiser's crown?
Now you will have to stay away
Alike from Rhine and Prague,
And more than that-shame and dismay
Your days and nights will plague.
Right well you knew, and all the world,
Right well they know this thing,
That Ferdinand alone can be
Bohemia's lawful king.
So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go
To Ferdinand, your king,
And beg him graciously to show
Full pardon for your sin.
""Poor Winter King,"" seventeenth-century song
Which of the following is an important underlying issue in this song? Choices: a) Rules of royal succession b) Religious conflict c) Military stalemate d) Social class conflicts 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main theme of the song. The song is about the Winter King, who has done something wrong and is being punished. The punishment is that he will have to stay away from certain places and will be plagued by shame and dismay.
Next, I need to analyze the reasons for the Winter King's punishment. The song states that the Winter King knew that Ferdinand alone could be Bohemia's lawful king, and that this is why he is being punished.
Now, I need to consider the underlying issue that is being addressed in the song. The song is not about religious conflict, military stalemate, or social class conflicts. It is about the rules of royal succession, specifically the idea that only certain people have the right to be king.

Output:
First, I need to identify the key information in the passage. The passage mentions that the sultan Musa collects duty on crude copper brought into his kingdom, and that he sells it for two-thirds of its weight in gold. It also mentions that he employs pagan nations in extracting gold from its deposits.
Next, I need to analyze the options and determine which one is supported by the passage. Option a) mentions the spread of religions through warfare, but the passage does not mention anything about religions or warfare. Option d) mentions nomadic migrations creating powerful empires, but the passage does not mention anything about nomadic migrations.
Option b) mentions international trade connections, which is supported by the passage. The passage mentions the trade of copper and gold, and the employment of pagan nations in extracting gold. This suggests that there were international trade connections during this period.
Option c) mentions the spread of diseases along trade routes, but the passage does not mention anything about diseases.

In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race â€” by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.
British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860
Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.
Rudrangshu Mukherjee, ""The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,"" 1990
The passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence? Choices: a) Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown b) Killing of civilians during wartime c) Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction d) State-sponsored campaigns of genocide 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passages. The passages describe the Cawnpore massacres, which occurred during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. They highlight the brutality and violence of the event, particularly the fact that it was perpetrated by a subject race against their masters.
Next, I need to analyze the nature of the violence described. The passages emphasize that the violence was not just a random act, but was rather a deliberate and calculated attempt to overthrow the British rule and re-establish native power. They also highlight the racial and religious dimensions of the violence, with the British being targeted specifically because of their race and religion.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown does not fit the context, as the passages describe a coordinated and organized rebellion, not random acts of banditry. Option b) Killing of civilians during wartime is also not a good fit, as the passages describe a specific event, not a general phenomenon of civilian casualties during war. Option c) Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction is not relevant, as the passages describe a historical event, not a modern conflict involving advanced weaponry. Option d) State-sponsored campaigns of genocide is the most fitting, as the passages describe a deliberate and systematic attempt to exterminate a particular group of people (the British) based on their race and religion.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

Although in Protestant Europe, [Peter the Great] was surrounded by evidence of the new civil and political rights of individual men embodied in constitutions, bills of rights and parliaments, he did not return to Russia determined to share power with his people. On the contrary, he returned not only determined to change his country but also convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force. He would try to lead; but where education and persuasion were not enough, he could driveâ€”and if necessary flogâ€”the backward nation forward.

First, I need to identify the key information in the passage. The passage states that Peter the Great was surrounded by evidence of new civil and political rights of individual men in Protestant Europe, but it does not indicate that he was interested in sharing power with his people.
Next, I need to analyze the passage to determine what kind of reforms Peter the Great was interested in. The passage states that Peter the Great was determined to change his country and provide both the direction and the motive force, and that he would try to lead but could drive and flog the backward nation forward if necessary.
Based on the passage, it appears that Peter the Great was interested in reforms that would allow him to maintain control and lead the country, rather than sharing power with his people.

""The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.
Firstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.
Secondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.
Thirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Popeâ€¦
â€¦The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only.

When the author of the passage above discusses the ""second wall,"" to what is he referring? Choices: a) The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate definition of ""Holy Ghost"" b) The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate use and interpretation of biblical texts c) The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate theological belief about the divinity of Jesus d) The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate method of baptism 
Output:
First, I need to identify the context of the passage. The passage is a critique of the Catholic Church by Martin Luther, a key figure in the Protestant Reformation.
Next, I need to understand the concept of the ""three walls"" mentioned in the passage. The three walls refer to the defenses or justifications used by the Catholic Church to resist reform.
Now, I need to analyze the specific ""second wall"" mentioned in the passage. The second wall refers to the Catholic Church's claim that only the Pope can interpret the Scriptures.

Choices: a) Highlight the extent of the author's property losses b) Express his opposition to the ongoing war c) Belittle British officials d) Place blame on both his home country as well as the Zulus 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the letter. The author is writing to his sister about the situation in South Africa during the Anglo-Zulu War.
The author mentions that he has insured his homestead for ï¿¡2,000, but the insurance companies will not cover the damage caused by the Queen's enemies. This suggests that the author is frustrated with the situation and is looking for compensation.
The author also mentions that he is suing the Government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives. This indicates that the author is seeking to hold someone accountable for the damage to his property.
The inclusion of the author's pending litigation with the British government serves to highlight the extent of the author's property losses. The author is using the fact that he is suing the government to emphasize the severity of the damage to his property.

Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at PotosÃ­ have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.
Antonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and PotosÃ­, 1620s
The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.

According to the second passage, which of the following contributed most to the burden faced by native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations? Choices: a) Interference by Russian Orthodox missionaries b) Native inexperience in hunting deep into the subarctic tundra c) Competition from Russian hunters and trappers d) Overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the question. The question is asking about the burden faced by native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations.
Next, I need to identify the key factors that contributed to this burden. The passage mentions several factors, including interference by Russian Orthodox missionaries, native inexperience in hunting, competition from Russian hunters and trappers, and overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals.
Now, I need to analyze the impact of each factor. The passage states that ""almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors."" This suggests that the lack of horses is a significant factor in the natives' inability to hunt and fulfill their tribute obligations.
The passage also mentions that ""now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands,"" which suggests that overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals is a significant factor in the natives' burden.
However, the passage does not mention interference by Russian Orthodox missionaries, native inexperience in hunting, or competition from Russian hunters and trappers as contributing factors to the burden faced by native Siberians.

In what way were women's lives in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. generally more restricted than women's lives had been globally before the advent of sedentary societies? Choices: a) Women were increasingly thought of as primary earners for the family. b) Women were increasingly responsible for the care of their children. c) Women's power increasingly fell within the private sphere. d) Women's power increasingly fell within the public sphere. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage, which is about the role of women in ancient Chinese society.
Next, I need to analyze the choices and determine which one is most relevant to the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E.
Choice a) Women were increasingly thought of as primary earners for the family. This is not accurate, as women's roles in ancient Chinese society were not primarily focused on earning a living.
Choice b) Women were increasingly responsible for the care of their children. While women did play a role in childcare, this was not a unique aspect of sedentary societies.
Choice c) Women's power increasingly fell within the private sphere. This is consistent with the passage, which describes women's roles in terms of domestic duties and family responsibilities.
Choice d) Women's power increasingly fell within the public sphere. This is not accurate, as women's roles in ancient Chinese society were generally limited to the private sphere.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

The passage below is the Chinese emperor's response to English King George III's diplomatic envoys, who were seeking expanded trading privileges (1793).
Strange and costly objects do not interest me. If I have commanded that the tribute offerings sent by you, O King, are to be accepted, this was solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar.... As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures. It behooves you, O King, to display even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity.
According to the passage, what was the Chinese reaction to the British goods? Choices: a) Awe at their technological superiority b) Fascination with their strangeness c) Offense at a perceived bribe d) Interpreting them as an act of submission 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key sentence in the passage that describes the Chinese reaction to the British goods. The sentence is: ""Strange and costly objects do not interest me.""
Next, I need to analyze the meaning of this sentence. The word ""do not interest me"" implies a lack of enthusiasm or value placed on the objects.
Now, I need to consider the context of the sentence. The Chinese emperor is responding to the British envoys' request for trading privileges, and the emperor is essentially dismissing the value of the goods being offered.
Based on this analysis, I can conclude that the Chinese reaction to the British goods was not one of awe, fascination, or offense, but rather a lack of interest or value placed on them.

First, I need to understand the context of the speech. The speech is about the importance of not falling behind in development and being beaten by others. It mentions the history of Russia being beaten by various groups due to its backwardness.
Next, I need to consider the historical developments that could be related to the speech. The speech mentions the importance of development and not falling behind, which is a common theme in the implementation of five-year plans.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) refers to the Winter War with Finland, which is not mentioned in the speech. Option b) refers to the Soviet Union becoming a nuclear nation, which is also not mentioned in the speech.

""My little homestead in the city, which I recently insured for ï¿¡2,000 would no doubt have shared the common fate, as the insurance companies will not make good that which is destroyed by the Queen's enemies. And although I have a farm of 50 acres close to the town, no doubt the crops and premises would have been destroyed. In fact, this has already partly been the case, and I am now suing the Government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives that have recently encamped not many hundred yards from the place, who have done much damage all around.""
Letter from a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War, South Africa, 1879
Which of the following reasons explains why European citizens moved in large numbers to Zulu lands in 1867? Choices: a) The British crown offered incentives to those who would establish homesteads in the unsettled lands of South Africa. b) The Zulu created attractive trade ports along the Indian Ocean. c) The Berlin Conference clarified boundaries, thus making it logistically sound for Europeans to move to the African colonies. d) A diamond rush ensued following the discovery of diamonds on Zulu lands. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the time period mentioned in the passage, which is 1879. However, the question asks about the year 1867, so I need to consider if there is any information that could be related to the year 1867.
The passage mentions that the writer has a farm of 50 acres close to the town, which implies that the writer has already established a homestead in the area. However, the passage also mentions that the writer's little homestead in the city was recently insured for ï¿¡2,000, which suggests that the writer is not a long-time resident of the area.
The passage does not mention anything about the Zulu creating attractive trade ports, the Berlin Conference, or a diamond rush. However, it does mention that the writer is suing the Government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives, which suggests that there may have been some kind of conflict or disturbance in the area.
Considering the information provided, the most plausible reason for European citizens moving to Zulu lands in 1867 is that the British crown offered incentives to those who would establish homesteads in the unsettled lands of South Africa. This is because the passage suggests that the writer is a relatively recent arrival in the area and is establishing a new homestead.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

""The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries. It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.
Non-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investmentsâ€¦The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.""
Kwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965
Which of the following most inspired the national plan advanced by Nkrumah in the second paragraph? Choices: a) Fascism b) Social Darwinism c) Classical liberalism d) Socialism 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. Kwame Nkrumah is discussing the concept of neo-colonialism and how it affects less developed countries.
Next, I need to identify the key idea of the national plan. The plan is about co-operating with all states, regardless of their economic systems, but with the goal of controlling foreign investment and ensuring that it aligns with the country's own interests.
Now, I need to consider the options and determine which ideology is most likely to inspire such a plan. Classical liberalism emphasizes individual freedom and free markets, which would not align with Nkrumah's goal of controlling foreign investment. Fascism and Social Darwinism are also not relevant to the context. Socialism, on the other hand, emphasizes state control and collective ownership, which would be more in line with Nkrumah's vision of a national plan that prioritizes the country's own interests.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.""
Mao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955
Which of the following later developments would most undermine the hopes expressed by Mao in the second-to-last line of the passage? Choices: a) The development of Special Economic Zones along the Chinese coast brought economic growth to China. b) Political friction with the Soviet Union pushed China into the orbit of the United States during the Cold War. c) The cooperatives of peasants on the farmland and an emphasis on countryside steel production brought famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry. d) Opposition voices in the Communist Party led by men such as Deng Xiaopeng were rooted out and silenced during the Cultural Revolution. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. Mao Zedong is expressing his hopes for the future of the worker-peasant alliance in China. He believes that the alliance can be consolidated by bringing about the socialist transformation of agriculture, industry, and commerce.
Next, I need to analyze the options and determine which one would most undermine the hopes expressed by Mao. Option a) is a positive development that would likely strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, as it would bring economic growth to China. Option b) is also a positive development, as it would allow China to maintain its independence and sovereignty. Option d) is a negative development, but it is not directly related to the worker-peasant alliance. Option c) is the most negative development, as it would bring famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry, which would undermine the hopes expressed by Mao for the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance.

By what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.
Lin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839
Which of the following most likely prompted the complaint voiced in the passage? Choices: a) British sale of opium in China b) British exports of tobacco to China c) British introduction of gunpowder to China d) British encouragement of heroin use to China 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main issue that the Chinese trade commissioner, Lin Zexu, is complaining about. The passage mentions ""that poisonous drug"" and ""the injurious drug,"" which refers to opium.
Next, I need to consider the historical context in which the letter was written. The letter was written in 1839, during the First Opium War between China and the United Kingdom.
Now, I need to analyze the relationship between the British and the Chinese during this time period. The British had been selling opium in China, which was prohibited by the Chinese government, and this had led to widespread addiction and social problems in China.
Therefore, the most likely prompt for the complaint voiced in the passage is the British sale of opium in China. {'sol': 'a'}"

Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China
In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
According to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry? Choices: a) They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so. b) They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces. c) They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs. d) They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. The passage is discussing the development of gunpowder weaponry in Europe and China during the 1200s through the 1400s.
Next, I need to identify the key point that explains why the Chinese failed to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry. The passage states that China was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, and early gunpowder weapons proved of little utility against them.
Now, I need to analyze the choices and select the one that best explains the Chinese failure. Choice a) is incorrect because there is no mention of Confucian traditionalism in the passage. Choice b) is also incorrect because the passage does not mention the Chinese putting too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces. Choice d) is incorrect because the passage does not mention the Chinese being unable to afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology.
Choice c) is the correct answer because it accurately reflects the reason given in the passage for the Chinese failure to innovate gunpowder weaponry. The Chinese decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs, which were to combat the highly mobile steppe nomads.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

How did Japan respond to the concerns raised by Lord Ii during this era? Choices: a) The government dismantled the Chinese-style civil service system. b) The government undertook a program of conquest in the Pacific. c) The country sent emissaries to study western democracies and industry. d) The country turned inward and closed its ports to all foreigners. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main concerns raised by Lord Ii. He is worried about the changes in the world, particularly the advancements in technology and military power, and how these changes might affect Japan's position as a powerful empire.
Next, I need to consider how Japan responded to these concerns. The correct response would be one that shows Japan taking steps to address the concerns and adapt to the changing world.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) is incorrect because dismantling the Chinese-style civil service system would not address the concerns about technology and military power. Option b) is also incorrect because a program of conquest would not address the concerns about being prepared for the changing world. Option d) is incorrect because closing the ports to foreigners would not allow Japan to learn from the West and adapt to the changes.

At the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated.... The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions... a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.

Which of the following was a long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s? Choices: a) Russia was excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance). b) Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity. c) Islam became the dominant religion of Russia. d) Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the information provided about the Mongol khans and their vast realm. The text states that the law code promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction, resulting in a well-policed domain where merchants and travelers could move without fear for their lives or property.
Next, I need to think about the long-term consequences of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s. The Mongols were known for their tolerance of different religions, and the text suggests that their rule facilitated the spread of ideas and inventions across their vast territory.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices. Choice a) suggests that Russia was excluded from Western European developments, but the Mongols actually facilitated international contact and the exchange of ideas. Choice c) suggests that Islam became the dominant religion of Russia, but the text does not mention this. Choice b) suggests that Russia became the administrative center of Mongol political activity, but the text does not mention this either. Choice d) suggests that Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy, which is consistent with the Mongols' ability to create a well-policed domain and facilitate international contact.

Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements of the passages. The Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 (Australia) and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (United States) both restrict immigration based on certain criteria, such as language proficiency, potential to become a public charge, and nationality.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the 1800s. During this time, there were various social and economic trends, including the rise of anti-Semitic ideologies, trade protectionism, a growing desire to attract skilled labor from abroad, and hardening of anti-immigrant sentiment.
Now, I need to analyze the key elements of the passages in relation to the historical context. The restrictions on immigration in the passages are not related to anti-Semitic ideologies, trade protectionism, or a desire to attract skilled labor from abroad. Instead, they reflect a hardening of anti-immigrant sentiment, as governments sought to limit the influx of certain groups, such as Chinese laborers and ""prohibited immigrants"" in Australia.

Senegalese poet LÃ©opold SÃ©dar Senghor, ""To New York,"" 1956
Which of the following best explains the phenomenon of an African poet writing so lyrically about New York? Choices: a) Outmigration from Africa due to political violence b) Stronger transatlantic influences linking art in Afro-Eurasia with that in the Americas c) Preference on the part of African intellectuals for Western cultural advancements d) Lack of a rich indigenous artistic tradition in Africa 
Output:
First, I need to consider the historical context of the poem. The poem was written in 1956, a time when many African countries were gaining independence from colonial rule.
Next, I need to think about the cultural exchange between Africa and the West during this period. The poem suggests that the poet, LÃ©opold SÃ©dar Senghor, was influenced by Western culture, particularly American jazz, which is mentioned in the poem.
Now, I need to consider the options. Option a) Outmigration from Africa due to political violence is unlikely, as the poem was written in 1956, a time of relative peace in Africa. Option c) Preference on the part of African intellectuals for Western cultural advancements is possible, but it does not fully explain the phenomenon of an African poet writing so lyrically about New York. Option d) Lack of a rich indigenous artistic tradition in Africa is also unlikely, as African cultures have a rich and diverse artistic heritage.

I have, in conformity without resolve, put together some few points concerning the reformation of the Christian estate, with the intent of placing the same before the Christian nobility of the German nation.... It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help.... These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.... That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality... That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope... That No One May Call a Council but the Pope.... Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night.... It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called ""cardinals""? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.
â€”Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation
Which of the following reformers expressed views similar to those expressed by Martin Luther in his letter above? Choices: a) Ulrich Zwingli b) Sir Thomas More c) Erasmus d) John Wycliffe 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main ideas expressed by Martin Luther in his letter. Luther criticizes the Roman Catholic Church for its corruption and abuse of power, particularly in the areas of wealth and authority. He argues that the Church has become too worldly and that its leaders are more concerned with accumulating wealth and power than with serving God.
Next, I need to consider the views of the other reformers listed. Ulrich Zwingli was a Swiss reformer who also criticized the Catholic Church, but his views were more focused on the need for reform from within the Church. Sir Thomas More was an English Catholic who opposed the Protestant Reformation and was executed for his views. Erasmus was a Dutch humanist who criticized the corruption of the Church, but he did not advocate for radical reform. John Wycliffe was an English reformer who criticized the Catholic Church and advocated for the translation of the Bible into vernacular languages, but his views were more focused on the need for reform from within the Church.
Now, I need to compare the views of the other reformers with those expressed by Luther. Based on the text, it appears that Luther's views are most similar to those of John Wycliffe, who also criticized the corruption of the Church and advocated for reform. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

Choices: a) The Ming Dynasty was very supportive of and welcoming to all commercial enterprise. b) The Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly to limit contact with foreigners and ease collection of taxes. c) The Ming Dynasty was too busy battling pirates along its coast to pay any attention to regular merchant activity. d) The Ming Dynasty only allowed Portugal to trade with China through Canton, permitting only one boat a year. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the information provided in the text to understand the trade policy in the later Ming Dynasty. The text describes the procedures that Portuguese and other foreigners followed when trading in China, which suggests that the Ming Dynasty had a set of rules and regulations for foreign trade.
Next, I need to examine the specific procedures mentioned in the text, such as registering names in a book, lying in boats outside the town, and not being allowed to stay in the town overnight. These procedures indicate that the Ming Dynasty was trying to control and limit the contact between foreigners and the local population.
Finally, I need to consider the purpose of these regulations. The text mentions that the Portuguese and other foreigners had to follow these procedures, and that if they stayed longer than allowed, they would be imprisoned. This suggests that the Ming Dynasty was trying to regulate trade strictly to limit contact with foreigners and ease collection of taxes.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Is it not unity alone that can weld us into an effective force, capable of creating our own progress and making our valuable contribution to world peace? Which independent African state will claim that its financial structure and banking institutions are fully harnessed to its national development? Which will claim that its material resources and human energies are available for its own national aspirations? We are fast learning that political independence is not enough to rid us of the consequences of colonial rule. We have been too busy nursing our separate states to understand fully the basic need for union, rooted in common purpose, common planning and common endeavour.
Ghana's president, Kwame Nkrumah, addressing the Organization of African Unity, 1963
The speaker in the passage above is espousing which of the following causes? Choices: a) Nationalism b) Socialism c) Pan-Africanism d) Neocolonialism 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of the passage. The speaker is talking about the need for African states to work together and be united in order to achieve their goals and contribute to world peace.
Next, I need to consider the options. Nationalism is the idea of promoting the interests of one's own nation, which is not the main idea of the passage. Socialism is an economic system, which is also not the main idea of the passage. Neocolonialism is the idea of maintaining control over a country after it has gained independence, which is the opposite of what the speaker is advocating for.
Pan-Africanism is the idea of promoting unity and cooperation among African states, which aligns with the main idea of the passage. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

By what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.
Lin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839
On which of the following arguments does the author of the passage principally base his appeal? Choices: a) It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own. b) Confucian teachings forbid the use of all narcotics as inherently immoral. c) Addiction is causing China to suffer an unfavorable balance of trade. d) Britain is unwise to risk the wrath of a militarily more powerful state. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main argument of the author. The author is appealing to the British to stop selling opium to China.
Next, I need to analyze the reasons given by the author for this appeal. The author argues that the British are aware of the harm caused by opium, as evidenced by their prohibition of it in their own country.
Finally, I need to determine which of the given choices best matches the author's argument. The author's argument is based on the idea that it is hypocritical for the British to sell a substance that they know is harmful in their own country, but prohibit it there.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

Letter from a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War, South Africa, 1879
A historian researching nineteenth-century conflicts in South Africa would most likely find this letter a useful source for information about which of the following? Choices: a) The diffusion of cultural practices throughout South Africa b) Economic boons present in British colonies c) Daily challenges of Afrikaners during the colonial period d) Unforeseen consequences of British imperialism 
Output:
First, I need to identify the context of the letter. The letter is written by a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War in South Africa in 1879.
Next, I need to analyze the content of the letter. The letter mentions the destruction of the writer's homestead and farm by a contingent of 1,500 natives, and the writer is suing the Government for damages.
Now, I need to consider the options. Option a) The diffusion of cultural practices throughout South Africa is not relevant to the letter, as it only mentions the destruction of property. Option b) Economic boons present in British colonies is also not relevant, as the letter does not mention any economic benefits. Option c) Daily challenges of Afrikaners during the colonial period is not relevant, as the letter is written by a British citizen, not an Afrikaner. Option d) Unforeseen consequences of British imperialism is relevant, as the letter mentions the destruction of property by a contingent of natives, which can be seen as a consequence of British imperialism.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
""In Northern India the existence of separate States at this period is usually little more than a question of words. A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.""
W.H. Moreland, India at the Death of Akbar, 1920
Zamindars had an ability ""to establish a claim to sovereignty"" largely due to the Mughal Empire's policy of Choices: a) religious toleration b) universal taxation c) martial law d) suffrage 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the question. The passage is discussing the Mughal Empire's policy and its impact on zamindars in Northern India.
Next, I need to identify the key point in the passage that relates to the question. The passage states that a zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was in a position of dependence, but could establish a claim to sovereignty by refusing to pay revenue.
Now, I need to analyze the options and determine which one is most closely related to the key point. The passage does not mention religious toleration, martial law, or suffrage as factors that contributed to the zamindars' ability to establish a claim to sovereignty. However, it does mention that the zamindars' ability to establish a claim to sovereignty was largely due to the Mughal Empire's policy of not actively enforcing its authority in certain regions, which is not explicitly mentioned in the options. However, the closest option is the one that implies a lack of active enforcement of authority, which is option b) universal taxation, as it implies that the Mughal Empire did not actively enforce its taxation policies in certain regions, allowing zamindars to establish a claim to sovereignty.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Yi Yin sacrificed to the former king, and presented the heir-king reverently before the shrine of his grandfather.... Yi Yin then clearly described the virtue of the Meritorious Ancestor for the instruction of the young king.
""Oh! of old the former kings of Xia cultivated earnestly their virtue, and then there were no calamities from Heaven. The spirits of the hills and rivers were all in tranquility; and the birds and beasts enjoyed their existence according to their nature. But their descendant did not follow their example, and Heaven sent down calamities, using our ruler, who possessed of its favor. The attack on Xia may be traced to the orgies in Ming Tiao.... Our king of Shang brilliantly displayed his sagely prowess; for oppression he substituted his generous gentleness. Now your Majesty is entering on the inheritance of his virtue; all depends on how you commence your reign.
""Oh! the former king began with careful attention to the bonds that hold men together.... Revere these warnings in your person.... The ways of Heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings, and on the evil-doer it sends down all miseries. If you not be virtuous, be it in large things or in small, it will bring the ruin of your ancestral temple.""

What does the phrase below tell us about the ruler? Choices: a) He had the Mandate of Heaven. b) He was an absolute monarch. c) He had lost the blessing of the gods. d) He was killed as a result of natural disasters. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. Yi Yin is addressing the young king, instructing him on the virtue of his grandfather, the Meritorious Ancestor.
Next, I need to identify the key points made by Yi Yin about the ruler. Yi Yin states that the former king of Xia cultivated virtue, but his descendant did not follow his example, leading to calamities from Heaven.
Now, I need to analyze the phrase that tells us about the ruler. The phrase states that the attack on Xia may be traced to the orgies in Ming Tiao, and that the ruler of Shang brilliantly displayed his sagely prowess, substituting oppression with generous gentleness.
The phrase does not mention the Mandate of Heaven, so choice a) is incorrect. The passage does not describe the ruler as an absolute monarch, so choice b) is also incorrect. The phrase does not mention the ruler being killed as a result of natural disasters, so choice d) is incorrect. The phrase does mention the ruler losing the blessing of the gods, as it states that Heaven sent down calamities, and that the ways of Heaven are not invariable, but rather send down blessings on the good-doer and miseries on the evil-doer.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight.... The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military... was relaxed... ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.

Most classical empires shared which of the following traits? Choices: a) They required the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire. b) They provided state support of foreign religions to improve support of the government. c) They embarked on widespread public works projects to integrate their empires. d) They had government bureaucracies based on the merit principle. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key traits of classical empires. The passage describes the decline of Rome, but it also provides insight into the characteristics of classical empires in general.
Next, I need to analyze each option to determine which one is most consistent with the passage. Option a) They required the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire. This option is not supported by the passage, as it mentions that the legions acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, implying that diversity was not limited.
Option b) They provided state support of foreign religions to improve support of the government. This option is also not supported by the passage, as it does not mention anything about state support of foreign religions.
Option c) They embarked on widespread public works projects to integrate their empires. This option is consistent with the passage, as it mentions that the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians, implying that the empire was not well-integrated.
Option d) They had government bureaucracies based on the merit principle. This option is not supported by the passage, as it mentions that the emperors were reduced to corrupting the discipline to maintain power.

""The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.
Firstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.
Secondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.
Thirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Popeâ€¦
â€¦The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only.

Martin Luther, Address to the Nobility of the German Nation, 1520
How is the ""temporal power"" mentioned in the passage best understood contextually? Choices: a) A clerical or ecclesiastical authority b) A legal or scholarly authority c) A state or secular authority d) A business or economic authority 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. Martin Luther is addressing the nobility of the German nation, and he is criticizing the Roman Catholic Church.
Next, I need to identify the ""temporal power"" mentioned in the passage. Luther states that the Romanists have drawn three walls around themselves, and the first wall is that they claim the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them.
Now, I need to determine what the ""temporal power"" refers to in this context. Given that Luther is discussing the relationship between the Church and the state, I believe the ""temporal power"" refers to the authority of the state or secular government.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

Which of the following segments of the Russian/Soviet population would probably have benefited most from the rising literacy rates depicted in the chart? Choices: a) The rural peasantry b) Members of the Russian Orthodox clergy c) The urban middle class d) Officers in the armed forces 
Output:
First, I need to consider the segments of the population that would benefit most from rising literacy rates. Generally, people in lower socio-economic positions, such as the rural peasantry, would benefit more from increased literacy rates because they would have better access to information and opportunities for social mobility.
Next, I need to consider the segments of the population that would benefit less from rising literacy rates. Members of the Russian Orthodox clergy, the urban middle class, and officers in the armed forces are likely to have higher levels of education and literacy already, so they would benefit less from the rising literacy rates.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

A comparison of both verses would best support which of the following conclusions? Choices: a) Many Muslims inclined toward atheism in the premodern era. b) Religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims. c) Christian missionaries were steadily winning converts among Muslim populations. d) Muslim intellectuals were generally hostile to traditional religious practice. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the content of both verses. The first verse from the Qur'an explicitly prohibits strong drink and games of chance, which are considered an infamy of Satan's handiwork. This suggests that Muslims are expected to avoid these activities.
Next, I need to compare this with the second verse from the RubÃ¡iyÃ¡t of Omar KhayyÃ¡m, which seems to be encouraging the consumption of wine and the enjoyment of life. This verse appears to be promoting a more hedonistic and possibly atheistic worldview.
Now, I need to consider the implications of this comparison. The fact that the Qur'an prohibits certain activities while the RubÃ¡iyÃ¡t of Omar KhayyÃ¡m seems to encourage them suggests that there may be a divergence between traditional religious practice and the views of some Muslim intellectuals.

How would twentieth-century economist John Maynard Keynes suggest that society address Otto von Bismarck's evaluation of workers in Germany? Choices: a) Keynes would recommend government intervention in order to maintain aggregate demand. b) Keynes would suggest helping elderly workers, but claim that the government should not intervene in most circumstances. c) Keynes would caution against government intervention in personal economic matters. d) Keynes would advocate doing nothing because he felt poverty in rural areas was actually more severe than it was in cities. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the problem. Otto von Bismarck is expressing concerns about the insecurity of workers' existence, particularly in terms of unemployment, illness, and old age.
Next, I need to consider John Maynard Keynes' economic theories. Keynes believed that government intervention was necessary to stabilize the economy and address issues of unemployment and poverty.
Now, I need to analyze the options. Option a) suggests that Keynes would recommend government intervention to maintain aggregate demand, which aligns with his economic theories. Option b) suggests that Keynes would suggest helping elderly workers, but claim that the government should not intervene in most circumstances, which contradicts Keynes' views on government intervention. Option c) suggests that Keynes would caution against government intervention in personal economic matters, which also contradicts Keynes' views. Option d) suggests that Keynes would advocate doing nothing, which is not supported by Keynes' economic theories.

To the house where those who dwell, do without light,
Where dirt is their drink, their food is of clayâ€¦
Where light cannot be seen. They dwell in the dark,
And upon the door and bolt, there lies dust.

Output:
First, I need to analyze the two texts to understand their main ideas. The first text describes a place of darkness and despair, where those who enter do not come out, and where the inhabitants dwell in the dark and eat clay. This suggests a negative view of the afterlife.
Next, I need to compare this view with the view presented in the second text. The second text emphasizes the importance of truth and obedience to the gods, and warns against wrongdoing. It also suggests that those who are guided by the gods will not lose their way.
Now, I need to consider the options and determine which one is supported by the texts. Option a) suggests that the ancient Egyptians had a less gloomy view of the afterlife than the ancient Sumerians, but the first text suggests the opposite. Option b) suggests that the ancient Egyptians were more inclined to view political obedience as morally proper, and this is supported by the second text, which emphasizes the importance of obedience to the gods. Option c) and d) are not supported by the texts.

Which of the following best describes the origins of epic poetry such as the Epic of Gilgamesh? Choices: a) The rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems b) The rise of a merchant class in cities who could sponsor the creation of original art c) The rise of a religious caste dedicated to solely recording the deeds of God-Kings d) The rise of a warrior elite whose deeds were worthy of praise and recording 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context in which the Epic of Gilgamesh was written. The text mentions the ""Seven Sages"" who laid the foundation of the city of Uruk, which suggests a high level of cultural and intellectual sophistication.
Next, I need to think about the purpose of the Epic of Gilgamesh. The text describes Gilgamesh as a king, and the epic is focused on his adventures and exploits. This suggests that the epic was written to celebrate the achievements of a powerful leader.
Now, I need to consider the options. Option a) mentions the rise of a literate class of scribes, which is a plausible explanation for the development of epic poetry. However, the text does not suggest that the epic was written solely for the purpose of recording poems. Option b) mentions the rise of a merchant class, but there is no evidence in the text to support this claim. Option c) mentions the rise of a religious caste, but the text does not suggest that the epic was written solely to record the deeds of God-Kings. Option d) mentions the rise of a warrior elite, but the text describes Gilgamesh as a king, not a warrior.

""Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
""But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.

But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!

Choices: a) The Tang Dynasty's strong bureaucracy at the local level b) The Tang Dynasty's large, standing professional army with no need of conscription c) Relatively advanced Tang agricultural technologies d) The relatively high level of urbanization in Tang China 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key information provided in the third stanza of the poem. The stanza mentions that the District Officers are demanding the land tax, but there is no land to tax because the Shanxi troops were never sent home and the crops are growing every which way, making it difficult to collect taxes.
Next, I need to analyze the options provided to see which one is supported by the information in the third stanza. Option a) mentions the Tang Dynasty's strong bureaucracy at the local level, but the poem does not provide any information about the bureaucracy. Option b) mentions the Tang Dynasty's large, standing professional army with no need of conscription, but the poem actually suggests the opposite: that the army is made up of conscripts and that the District Officers are demanding the land tax, implying that the army is not self-sufficient. Option c) mentions relatively advanced Tang agricultural technologies, but the poem actually suggests the opposite: that the crops are growing every which way and the fields are a mess, implying that the agricultural technologies are not advanced. Option d) mentions the relatively high level of urbanization in Tang China, but the poem does not provide any information about urbanization.

Next, I need to determine which of the given choices is the greatest volume of additional silver that came to China. The paragraph mentions that the Portuguese bring about 600 coins from Japan, but it does not mention any other sources of silver from Japan. However, it does mention that they bring 200,000 coins more in silver from India.

The reasons given in the above passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to which other classical empires? Choices: a) Tang and Ottoman b) Ming and Aztec c) Han and Gupta d) Qin and Etruscan 
Output:
First, I need to identify the reasons given in the passage for the fall of the Roman Empire. The passage mentions that the decline of Rome was caused by its immoderate greatness, which led to the principle of decay. It also mentions that the victorious legions acquired vices and corrupted the discipline, which led to the relaxation of the military and the fall of the empire.
Next, I need to consider the characteristics of the other classical empires listed in the choices. I need to think about which empires were known for their immoderate greatness, corruption, and military decline.
The Tang and Ottoman empires were known for their military prowess and administrative efficiency, but they were not known for their immoderate greatness or corruption. The Ming and Aztec empires were known for their cultural achievements, but they were not known for their military decline. The Han and Gupta empires were known for their economic prosperity and cultural achievements, but they were not known for their military decline. The Qin and Etruscan empires were known for their military conquests and administrative efficiency, but they were not known for their immoderate greatness or corruption.
However, the Qin and Etruscan empires were also known for their short-lived nature and the fact that they were eventually conquered by other empires. This is similar to the Roman Empire, which was eventually conquered by the Barbarians. Therefore, the reasons given in the passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to the Qin and Etruscan empires.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

Woman, wake up; the bell of reason is being heard throughout the whole universe; discover your rights. Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!

The independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fearâ€”but apart from that, nothing has changed.
Halima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence
Which of the following factors is likeliest to have prevented the sort of progress hoped for by the speaker in the second passage? Choices: a) Failure to eradicate Islamic traditionalism b) Lack of industrial assets or infrastructure c) Hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites d) Prioritization of national liberation over social reform 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context of the passage. Halima Ghomri is an Algerian woman who lived through the country's war of independence. She expresses disappointment that the independence did not bring about the changes she had hoped for, particularly in terms of education for her children.
Next, I need to analyze the factors that might have prevented the progress she hoped for. Option a) Failure to eradicate Islamic traditionalism might have contributed to the lack of progress, but it is not the most direct factor. Option b) Lack of industrial assets or infrastructure could have hindered economic development, but it is not directly related to the issue of education.
Option c) Hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites is a plausible factor, as it could have led to the perpetuation of patriarchal attitudes and the denial of education to women. However, it is not the most likely factor in this context.
Option d) Prioritization of national liberation over social reform is the most likely factor. The Algerian war of independence was a nationalist movement that focused on gaining independence from colonial rule. While it was a necessary step, it did not necessarily address the social and economic issues that affected women like Halima Ghomri. The new elites that emerged after independence may have prioritized national development over social reform, leading to the perpetuation of existing social inequalities.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

Excerpt from the inscription of Kerdir at Naqsh-e-Rustam, Persia, late third century C.E.
The source best supports which of the following inferences about sources of political authority in the period circa 600 B.C.E.â€“600 C.E.? Choices: a) Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule by their sponsorship of religion and chief priests. b) Rulers were limited in their political authority by powerful religious figures. c) Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule through victories over foreign peoples. d) Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule through the consent of those they governed. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key points in the text that relate to the question. The text describes the relationship between the rulers of the empire and the chief priest, Kerdir. It states that the rulers, Hormizd and Bahram, conferred on Kerdir a higher rank and dignity, and gave him authority and power in matters of the divine services. It also states that the rulers held Kerdir in high honor and dignity, and that Kerdir was given the title ""Kerdir, Ahura Mazda's [Chief Priest]"".
Next, I need to analyze the relationship between the rulers and Kerdir. The text suggests that the rulers derived their legitimacy for their rule from their sponsorship of religion and their relationship with Kerdir, the chief priest. The text states that the rulers gave Kerdir authority and power in matters of the divine services, and that Kerdir was given a higher rank and dignity. This suggests that the rulers saw their relationship with Kerdir as a way to legitimize their rule.
Finally, I need to evaluate the answer choices based on my analysis. Choice a) Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule by their sponsorship of religion and chief priests, is supported by the text. The text describes how the rulers sponsored religion and gave Kerdir authority and power in matters of the divine services. Choice b) Rulers were limited in their political authority by powerful religious figures, is not supported by the text. The text suggests that the rulers had a close relationship with Kerdir, and that Kerdir was given authority and power by the rulers. Choice c) Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule through victories over foreign peoples, is not mentioned in the text. Choice d) Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule through the consent of those they governed, is not mentioned in the text.

""Al-Zawawi also said 'This sultan Musa told me that at a town called ZKRY he has a copper mine from which ingots are brought to BYTY. ""There is nothing in my kingdom, Musa said, on which a duty is levied except this crude copper which is brought in. Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.""

Based on your knowledge of world history and the passage, Mansa Musa's assertion about the lack of duties levied on goods in his kingdom most strongly reflects which of the following about the kingdom of Mali? Choices: a) Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals. b) Mali's wealth came in large part from its conquest of pagan neighbors. c) Mali's wealth came in large part from large agricultural estates. d) Mali's wealth came in large part from the exploitation of the slave trade. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. Mansa Musa is talking about the copper mine in his kingdom and how it is used to collect duty and sell it for gold.
Next, I need to analyze the information provided in the passage. Mansa Musa states that the only thing on which duty is levied in his kingdom is the crude copper brought in from the mine. This suggests that the copper mine is a significant source of revenue for the kingdom.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) suggests that Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals. This aligns with the information provided in the passage, which highlights the importance of the copper mine in the kingdom's revenue.
Option b) suggests that Mali's wealth came in large part from its conquest of pagan neighbors. However, the passage does not mention anything about conquest or the exploitation of pagan neighbors.
Option c) suggests that Mali's wealth came in large part from large agricultural estates. However, the passage does not mention anything about agriculture or estates.
Option d) suggests that Mali's wealth came in large part from the exploitation of the slave trade. However, the passage does not mention anything about the slave trade.

Choices: a) Chinese merchants' domination of East Asian trade b) Competition between Dutch and Portuguese traders for markets in Japan c) European participation in East Asian trade patterns d) Jesuit missionary work in Japan and China 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements of the route described by Ralph Fitch. The Portuguese sailors travel from Macao in China to Japan, carrying goods such as white silk, gold, musk, and porcelain, and bringing back silver.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the time period. The description of the route suggests that the Portuguese are actively engaging in trade with China and Japan, and are bringing back valuable goods such as silver.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices in light of this information. Choice a) Chinese merchants' domination of East Asian trade is not supported by the description, as the Portuguese are the ones carrying out the trade. Choice b) Competition between Dutch and Portuguese traders for markets in Japan is not mentioned in the description. Choice c) European participation in East Asian trade patterns is directly supported by the description, as the Portuguese are actively engaging in trade with China and Japan.

Mao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955
Mao's quotation is best understood in the context of which of the following? Choices: a) Governments in communist countries implementing liberal political and economic reforms to mitigate social unrest b) Governments promoting collectivization of the land to reduce inequality between sectors of the population c) Governments promoting policies intended to hasten industrialization d) Governments promoting capitalist policies to reduce inequality between sectors of the population 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the quotation. Mao Zedong is discussing the issue of agricultural co-operation and the need to address the growing polarization in the countryside.
Next, I need to identify the key issue that Mao is addressing. The key issue is the growing inequality between peasants, with some becoming rich and others remaining poor.
Now, I need to consider the options and determine which one best fits the context of the quotation. Option b) Governments promoting collectivization of the land to reduce inequality between sectors of the population is the most relevant, as Mao is advocating for the socialist transformation of agriculture to address the growing inequality.

As for their men there is no sexual jealousy in them. And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons.... They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.

What evidence is there in the passage that the Malians take their Muslim faith seriously? Choices: a) The genealogy is derived from the maternal side. b) They study Islamic law faithfully. c) The men do not yield to sexual jealousy. d) They enjoy friendship with all, regardless of gender. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements that indicate the Malians take their Muslim faith seriously. The passage mentions that the men are ""Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart."" This suggests that they are committed to their faith and actively engage in religious practices.
Next, I need to consider the other options and determine if they provide evidence of the Malians' commitment to their faith. Option a mentions the genealogy being derived from the maternal side, but this is not necessarily related to their faith. Option c mentions that the men do not yield to sexual jealousy, but this is actually a characteristic that is not in line with traditional Islamic values. Option d mentions that they enjoy friendship with all, regardless of gender, but this is actually a characteristic that is not in line with traditional Islamic values of modesty and segregation of the sexes.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Mao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955
Mao's view of the cooperation of peasant labor most directly reflects the influence of which of the following? Choices: a) The ideals of communism as stated by Joseph Stalin b) The ideals of the Enlightenment as stated by political revolutionaries such as Maximilian Robespierre c) The ideals of classical liberalism as stated by Adam Smith d) The ideals of globalization as evidenced by multinational trade blocs such as NAFTA or the European Union 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. Mao Zedong is discussing the issue of peasant labor and the need for cooperation to address the polarization in the countryside.
Next, I need to identify the key elements of Mao's view on cooperation. Mao emphasizes the need for socialist transformation of agriculture and the elimination of the rich-peasant economy and individual economy in the countryside.
Now, I need to consider the possible influences on Mao's view. The ideals of communism as stated by Joseph Stalin emphasize the collective ownership of the means of production and the abolition of private property, which aligns with Mao's emphasis on socialist transformation and the elimination of individual economies.
The ideals of the Enlightenment, as stated by Maximilian Robespierre, emphasize the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity, but do not directly address the issue of collective ownership of the means of production.
The ideals of classical liberalism, as stated by Adam Smith, emphasize the principles of individual freedom and the free market, which are in direct conflict with Mao's emphasis on socialist transformation and collective ownership.
The ideals of globalization, as evidenced by multinational trade blocs such as NAFTA or the European Union, emphasize the principles of free trade and economic integration, but do not directly address the issue of collective ownership of the means of production.

It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes.

The views expressed in the excerpt are best seen as evidence of which of the following in Roman society? Choices: a) Disgust for barbarian peoples b) Concern about barbarian attacks c) Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy d) Maintenance of large armies 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the tone of the passage to understand the views expressed by the Roman aristocracy. The passage describes the extermination of the Bructeri by the Chamavi and Angrivarii with great enthusiasm and delight, indicating that the Roman aristocracy is pleased with the outcome.
Next, I need to consider the reasons given for the extermination of the Bructeri. The passage mentions hatred of their tyranny, the attractions of plunder, and heaven's regard for the Romans as possible reasons. These reasons suggest that the Roman aristocracy views the extermination as a means to achieve their own interests and goals.
Now, I need to evaluate the options to determine which one best reflects the views expressed in the passage. Option a) Disgust for barbarian peoples is not supported by the passage, as the Roman aristocracy seems to be pleased with the outcome. Option b) Concern about barbarian attacks is also not supported, as the passage does not express concern about the Bructeri's military power. Option d) Maintenance of large armies is not relevant to the passage, which focuses on the extermination of a specific tribe.

I have, in conformity without resolve, put together some few points concerning the reformation of the Christian estate, with the intent of placing the same before the Christian nobility of the German nation.... It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help.... These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.... That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality... That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope... That No One May Call a Council but the Pope.... Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night.... It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called ""cardinals""? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.

In his letter, Martin Luther avoided speaking about which of the following topics? Choices: a) The wealth of the church b) The power of the clergy c) The sale of indulgences d) The political nature of the church 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main topics discussed in the letter. Martin Luther talks about the distress and misery of the Christian estates, the three walls that the Romanists have drawn around themselves, and the need for reform. He also criticizes the wealth and power of the clergy, and the way that the church is run.
Next, I need to consider the options and determine which topic is not mentioned in the letter. The letter does mention the wealth of the church (option a), the power of the clergy (option b), and the political nature of the church (option d). However, it does not mention the sale of indulgences (option c).

There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.
I hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.

Choices: a) The Zionist movement that created the modern state of Israel b) The independence movements that freed the states of southeast Asia from colonial rule c) The civil rights movements that changed the legal status of minorities in the United States d) The communist movement that changed the government of Cuba 
Output:
First, I need to identify the context of the message. The message is from Mahatma Gandhi, who was a key figure in the Indian independence movement.
Next, I need to understand the content of the message. Gandhi is urging his followers to remain non-violent in the face of the arrest of Maulana Mohamed Ali, a prominent Muslim leader.
Now, I need to consider the historical context. The message was sent in 1921, during the Indian independence movement. Gandhi's message is urging his followers to remain non-violent in the face of arrest and to continue their struggle for independence.
Considering the options, I can see that the message is most likely inspiring the independence movements that freed the states of southeast Asia from colonial rule. This is because the message is urging non-violent resistance to colonial rule, which was a key strategy used by many independence movements in the region.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Which of the following economic activities did the most to drive the rising levels of immigration that led to the enactment of the law described in the second passage? Choices: a) Railroad construction b) Fertilizer harvesting c) Sugarcane production d) Gold mining 
Output:
First, I need to identify the time period in which the law was enacted. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was enacted during the late 19th century, a time of rapid economic growth and industrialization in the United States.
Next, I need to consider the economic activities that were prevalent during this time period. Railroad construction, fertilizer harvesting, sugarcane production, and gold mining were all significant economic activities during this time.
However, the most significant economic activity that drove the rising levels of immigration during this time was the construction of railroads. The construction of the transcontinental railroad, which was completed in 1869, created a huge demand for labor, and many immigrants came to the United States to work on the railroad.

The views expressed in the passage are best seen as evidence for which of the following in the society of Spanish South America? Choices: a) The formal adoption of debt slavery as a means to clear debts b) The absence of corruption among elites c) The king's lack of interest in the welfare of Native American subjects d) The imposition of social stratification based on origin of birth 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main issue presented in the passage. The passage describes the harsh treatment of Indians in the mines of Spanish South America, including torture, death, and exploitation.
Next, I need to analyze the views expressed in the passage. The author, Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala, is a Native American who is criticizing the treatment of Indians in the mines. He describes the mine owners as tyrants who are not audited or inspected, and who exploit the Indians for their labor and resources.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) The formal adoption of debt slavery as a means to clear debts is not supported by the passage, as the author does not mention debt slavery. Option b) The absence of corruption among elites is not supported by the passage, as the author describes the mine owners as corrupt and bribing colonial officials. Option c) The king's lack of interest in the welfare of Native American subjects is not supported by the passage, as the author mentions that the protector of the Indians is useless and does not warn the king or the royal Audiencia about the harms done to the Indians. Option d) The imposition of social stratification based on origin of birth is supported by the passage, as the author describes the exploitation of Indians by mine owners who are of Spanish, mestizo, or Indian origin.

Ibn Battuta, Voyages, 1332â€“1346 C.E.
Which of the following conclusions about the period 600 C.E.â€“1450 C.E. is most directly supported by the passage? Choices: a) Long-distance contact between civilizations stagnated. b) New religious traditions overturned prior lasting religious beliefs. c) The empires of steppe nomads united trade links across Eurasia. d) Technological developments spread across trade routes. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key information in the passage. The passage describes the presence of Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Turks in the city of Hangzhou, China, and mentions the existence of mosques, colleges, and other Islamic institutions.
Next, I need to consider the time period mentioned in the passage, which is 1332â€“1346 C.E. This is within the time period of 600 C.E.â€“1450 C.E.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices in light of the key information and time period. Choice a) Long-distance contact between civilizations stagnated is not supported by the passage, as it describes the presence of people from different civilizations in Hangzhou. Choice b) New religious traditions overturned prior lasting religious beliefs is not supported by the passage, as it describes the coexistence of different religious groups in Hangzhou. Choice c) The empires of steppe nomads united trade links across Eurasia is supported by the passage, as it mentions the presence of Turks, who are likely descendants of the Mongol Empire, which was founded by Genghis Khan. Choice d) Technological developments spread across trade routes is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention any technological developments.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at PotosÃ­ have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.
Antonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and PotosÃ­, 1620s
The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.
Heinrich von FÃ¼ch, ""On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,"" 1744
Both passages are best seen in the context of which of the following broad developments? Choices: a) Emerging systems of coerced labor b) The expansion of chattel slavery c) Increased reliance on prison-camp workforces d) Colonization of overseas territories by joint-stock companies 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passages. Both passages describe the exploitation of indigenous peoples in the New World and Siberia. The first passage describes the mita system, where Indians are forced to work in mercury mines, and the second passage describes the yasak tribute system, where natives are forced to pay tribute in the form of furs or cash.
Next, I need to identify the common theme in both passages. Both passages describe systems of forced labor or tribute, where indigenous peoples are exploited by colonial powers.
Now, I need to consider the options. Option a) Emerging systems of coerced labor is the most relevant to the context of the passages. The mita system and the yasak tribute system are both examples of coerced labor, where indigenous peoples are forced to work or pay tribute against their will.
Option b) The expansion of chattel slavery is not directly relevant to the context of the passages. While chattel slavery is a form of coerced labor, it is not the specific type of labor described in the passages.
Option c) Increased reliance on prison-camp workforces is not relevant to the context of the passages. The passages do not describe the use of prison camps or forced labor in a modern industrial context.
Option d) Colonization of overseas territories by joint-stock companies is not directly relevant to the context of the passages. While the passages do describe the exploitation of indigenous peoples by colonial powers, they do not specifically mention joint-stock companies.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

The purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.
We believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.""

""The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression. This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.
As we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women's liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation. In order to build this alliance, the brothers in gay liberation will have to be prepared to sacrifice that degree of male chauvinism and male privilege that they still all possess.""

According to the text, the authors of Source 3 see which of the following as an obstacle to achieving Gay Liberation? Choices: a) Rigid societal gender roles b) Conflicts with the women's rights movement c) Societal privileging of some races over others d) Inequity in pay scales 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main goal of the authors of Source 3. According to the text, the long-term goal of Gay Liberation is to ""rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression.""
Next, I need to understand what the authors see as the obstacle to achieving this goal. According to the text, the obstacle is the ""social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles.""
Now, I need to compare the obstacle identified in the text with the options provided. The text does not mention conflicts with the women's rights movement, societal privileging of some races over others, or inequity in pay scales as obstacles to achieving Gay Liberation. However, it does mention rigid societal gender roles as an obstacle.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
At the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated.... The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions... a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.

Which statement most accurately compares the Mongol (post-classical) empire with the Persian (classical) empire? Choices: a) Both the Mongols and the Persians allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures. b) The Mongols invested in building large-scale monuments, whereas the Persians focused on public works. c) Both the Persians and the Mongols improved the social, economic, and legal status of women. d) The Mongols created a new syncretic belief system, but the Persians maintained a traditional monotheistic religion. 
Output:
First, I need to compare the Mongol and Persian empires based on the information provided. The text states that the Mongols allowed conquered peoples to live together in peace and tolerated virtually all religions, which suggests that they allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures.
Next, I need to compare the Mongols and Persians in terms of their investment in building large-scale monuments. The text does not mention the Mongols building large-scale monuments, but it does mention that the Mongols created a secure and well-policed territory that facilitated trade and the exchange of ideas.
Finally, I need to compare the Mongols and Persians in terms of their treatment of women. The text does not mention the Mongols improving the social, economic, and legal status of women, but it does mention that the Mongols allowed conquered peoples to live together in peace and tolerated virtually all religions.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

Which of the following would best support the author's assertion regarding the ""quantum jump"" that would help Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.? Choices: a) The colonization of the interior of Africa b) The conquest of the Aztec Empire c) The reformation of Catholic Christianity d) The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan 
Output:
First, I need to understand what the author means by a ""quantum jump"" in productivity. The author suggests that Western Europe needed to increase its productivity significantly in order to achieve global hegemony.
Next, I need to consider the options provided and think about which one would best support the author's assertion. The colonization of the interior of Africa (option a) would not have been a significant factor in Western Europe's rise to global hegemony, as it was not a major player in African colonization during this time period.
The conquest of the Aztec Empire (option b) would have provided Western Europe with access to new resources and labor, which could have contributed to a significant increase in productivity.
The reformation of Catholic Christianity (option c) would not have had a direct impact on Western Europe's productivity or its ability to achieve global hegemony.
The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan (option d) would not have had any impact on Western Europe's productivity or its ability to achieve global hegemony.

Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.
William Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, ""On the Suppression of Sati,"" 1829
I have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].
George Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826
The authors of both passages served institutions associated with which of the following colonial techniques commonly used by Western imperial powers? Choices: a) Direct rule by the crown b) Complete privatization of colonial authority c) Martial law enforced by sizable armies d) The chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits 
Output:
First, I need to identify the institutions associated with the authors of the passages. William Bentinck was the Governor-General of India, which is a position associated with direct rule by the crown. George Simpson was the Head of the Northern Department of the Hudson's Bay Company, which is a company chartered to assume costs and share profits.
Next, I need to consider the colonial techniques commonly used by Western imperial powers. Direct rule by the crown refers to the practice of a Western power governing a colony directly, without the involvement of local authorities. Complete privatization of colonial authority refers to the practice of a Western power granting a private company or individual the authority to govern a colony. Martial law enforced by sizable armies refers to the practice of a Western power using military force to govern a colony. The chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits refers to the practice of a Western power granting a private company the authority to govern a colony in exchange for a share of the profits.
Finally, I need to determine which colonial technique is associated with the institutions of the authors of the passages. Based on the information provided, both William Bentinck and George Simpson are associated with institutions that are involved in governing colonies, but only George Simpson's institution is chartered to assume costs and share profits. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on.
A soldier says simply: ""They call up more every day.
""Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
""But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.""
Du Fu, ""Ballad of the Army Carts,"" ca. 750 C.E.
The poem provides evidence of which of the following with respect to gender relations in Tang society? Choices: a) Confucian relationships between husband and wife were still strong in Tang society. b) Imperial rescripts emphasized the birth of able sons over daughters to fulfill conscription quotas. c) Agricultural work could be shared by women and men alike. d) Traditional Chinese gender relations were reversed during the reign of Empress Wu Zetian. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the poem to understand the context and the message it conveys. The poem describes the hardships faced by soldiers and the difficulties of rural life in Tang society. It mentions the conscription of men, the difficulties of farming, and the challenges of paying taxes.
Next, I need to identify the specific information related to gender relations in the poem. The poem mentions that it's ""bad luck to bear a son now"" and that it's ""better to have a daughter: at least she can marry / And live with the neighbors next door."" This suggests that the birth of a son is seen as a burden, as he will likely be conscripted into the army and sent away.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices based on the information in the poem. Choice a) is incorrect because the poem does not mention the strength of Confucian relationships between husband and wife. Choice c) is incorrect because the poem suggests that agricultural work is difficult and that women are not expected to participate in it. Choice d) is incorrect because the poem does not mention Empress Wu Zetian or the reversal of traditional gender roles during her reign.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

Compared to the observations expressed in the excerpt, Mongol administration of its Russian domains in the period 600 C.E. to 1450 C.E. differed in that it Choices: a) was only tolerant of Orthodox Christianity, while the Mongol administration in China favored many religious traditions b) relied heavily on tribute from the Russian principalities, while the Mongol administration in China emulated a centralized Chinese bureaucratic state c) was viewed favorably by its subjects, while the Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest d) stimulated Russian export of trade goods to China, while the Mongol administration in China intentionally curtailed Chinese economic activity 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the Mongol administration in China during the period 600 C.E. to 1450 C.E. The excerpt from Ibn Battuta's Voyages describes the Mongol administration in China as being tolerant of various religious traditions, including Islam, and even favoring the Muslims. This is evident in the fact that the Muslims have their own town, cells, colleges, and mosques, and are made much of by the Kings of China.
Next, I need to compare this with the Mongol administration of its Russian domains during the same period. The Mongol administration in Russia was known for its brutal and oppressive nature, and it did not tolerate any form of dissent or opposition. In fact, the Mongols were known to have massacred entire cities and populations that resisted their rule.
Now, I need to evaluate the options based on the information. Option a) is incorrect because the Mongol administration in Russia was not tolerant of Orthodox Christianity, but rather suppressed it. Option b) is also incorrect because the Mongol administration in China did not rely on tribute from the Russian principalities, but rather emulated a centralized Chinese bureaucratic state. Option c) is incorrect because the Mongol administration in Russia was not viewed favorably by its subjects, but rather was feared and resented. Option d) is the correct answer because the Mongol administration in China did stimulate Russian export of trade goods to China, and the Mongol administration in China did intentionally curtail Chinese economic activity.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

Which of the following developments from the period 1750â€“1900 C.E. most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph? Choices: a) The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants b) Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas c) The Industrial Revolution d) The colonization of Africa 
Output:
First, I need to understand the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph. The Portuguese are trading with Japan and China, bringing silver from Japan and India to China, and in return, they are getting gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and other valuable goods from China.
Next, I need to consider the developments from the period 1750â€“1900 C.E. that could have disrupted these trade patterns. The Industrial Revolution (c) is a major development that could have had a significant impact on trade patterns. The Industrial Revolution led to the development of new technologies and manufacturing processes, which in turn led to the growth of industry and the expansion of global trade. However, the Industrial Revolution also led to the decline of traditional trade patterns, as new technologies and manufacturing processes made it possible to produce goods more cheaply and efficiently in Europe and other parts of the world, rather than relying on imports from Asia.
The colonization of Africa (d) could also have had an impact on trade patterns, but it is not as directly related to the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph as the Industrial Revolution is.
The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants (a) is not a development that would have disrupted the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph, as the paragraph suggests that the Chinese were already interested in purchasing goods from European merchants.
Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas (b) may have had some impact on trade patterns, but it is not as directly related to the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph as the Industrial Revolution is.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

An Act to place certain restrictions on Immigration and to provide for the removal from the Commonwealth of Prohibited Immigrants.

3. The immigration into the Commonwealth of the persons described in any of the following paragraphs in this section (hereinafter called ""prohibited immigrants"") is prohibited, namely
(a) Any person who when asked to do so by an officer fails to write out at dictation and sign in the presence of the officer a passage of fifty words in length in a European language directed by the officer;
(b) Any person in the opinion of the Minister or of an officer to become a charge upon the public or upon any public or charitable organisation;
â€¦
(g) Any persons under a contract or agreement to perform manual labour within the Commonwealth: Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to workmen exempted by the Minister for special skill required by Australiaâ€¦
Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 (Australia)
Whereas in the opinion of the Government of the United States the coming of Chinese laborers to this country endangers the good order of certain localities within the territory thereof;
Therefore,
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That from and after the expiration of ninety days next after the passage of this act, the coming of Chinese laborers to the United States be suspended; and during such suspension it shall not be lawful for any Chinese laborer to come, or having so come after the expiration of said ninety days to remain within the United States.
SEC. 2. That the master of every vessel who shall knowingly bring within the United States on such vessel, and land or permit to be landed, any Chinese laborer, from any foreign port or place, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars for each and every such Chinese laborer so brought, and may be also imprisoned for a term not exceeding one yearâ€¦.
Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (United States)
The emphasis on language in the first passage is most safely interpreted as Choices: a) a concern for high educational standards in a rapidly growing society. b) a tactic allowing the exclusion of non-Europeans without referring directly to race. c) a measure to ensure that all immigrants possessed useful expertise. d) an attempt to bar all immigrants regardless of origin. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context of the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901. The Act is concerned with restricting immigration to Australia, and it lists various categories of ""prohibited immigrants."" The emphasis on language in paragraph (a) is not primarily about educational standards or expertise, but rather about excluding non-Europeans.
Next, I need to examine the language used in the Act. The Act does not explicitly mention race, but it does use language that is clearly discriminatory, such as the requirement that immigrants write out a passage of 50 words in length in a European language. This suggests that the emphasis on language is a tactic to exclude non-Europeans without directly referring to race.
Finally, I need to consider the historical context of the Act. The Act was passed in 1901, a time when Australia was still a British colony and there was a strong desire to maintain a white, European-dominated society. The emphasis on language in the Act is consistent with this broader goal of excluding non-Europeans.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

This ruler of Syria made me spend many years as commander of his army,

I overcame.
I destroyed its green fields and its wells,
I captured its cattle, I took captive its inhabitants, I deprived them of their provisions,
and I slew [many] peopleâ€¦by my sword, my bow, my marchings, and my good devices.
Thus my excellence was in his heart; he loved me and he knew my valor;
â€¦he set me at the head of his sons, when he saw the success of my handiwork.
There came a champion of Syria
to defy me in my tent;
a bold man without equal, for he had vanquished all his rivals.
He said, ""Let Sanehat fight with me.""
He thought to overcome me; he designed to take my cattle, thus being counseled by his tribe.
The Tale of Sanehat, Egyptian poem written during the Middle Kingdom, ca.1800 B.C.E.
Which of the following best describes the most common political significance of conflict between states to the rulers of early civilizations? Choices: a) Victories against outsiders granted legitimacy to leaders of states. b) Victories against outsiders provided slaves whose labor sustained agricultural systems. c) Victories against outsiders demonstrated the power of divinities over other gods. d) Victories against outsiders allowed leaders of states to incorporate the elites of the subjugated into the conquering power. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the context of the poem. The poem describes the ruler of Syria and his military campaigns, where he overcomes various lands and defeats their inhabitants.
Next, I need to identify the political significance of these conflicts. The poem suggests that the ruler's victories against outsiders granted him legitimacy and recognition, as he is praised for his excellence and valor.
Now, I need to consider the other options. While victories against outsiders may have provided slaves or demonstrated divine power, these are not the primary political significance of these conflicts in the context of the poem.

When the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.""
Ralph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.
Which of the following developments from the period 1450â€“1750 C.E. most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph? Choices: a) The eastward expansion of Russia b) The Portuguese conquest of India c) The establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate d) The Spanish conquest of Mexico 
Output:
First, I need to identify the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph. The Portuguese are trading with Japan and China, bringing silver from Japan and India to China, and bringing back gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and other costly items from China.
Next, I need to consider the developments listed in the choices and how they might affect these trade patterns. The Portuguese conquest of India (b) could potentially disrupt trade patterns in the region, but it does not directly affect the trade between Japan and China.
The establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate (c) in Japan in 1603 C.E. led to the closure of Japan to European trade, which would directly affect the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph.
The eastward expansion of Russia (a) and the Spanish conquest of Mexico (d) do not directly affect the trade patterns between Japan and China.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
""Purusa-Sukta""
Purusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.
It was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.
When they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.

Which of the following statements is supported by the information in the passage above? Choices: a) The caste system was a purely social construct that reflected its time period. b) The caste system was encouraged by regional princes to reinforce social stability. c) The caste system reinforced Indian identity in the face of Muslim invaders. d) The caste system was integral to the Hindu religion, transcending historical eras. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of the passage. The passage describes the creation myth of the Purusa, which is the lord of the immortals, and how he was sacrificed to create the world and the different castes.
Next, I need to analyze the information provided in the passage. The passage states that the Brahman was born from Purusa's mouth, the Ksatriya from his arms, the Vaisya from his thighs, and the Sudra from his feet.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices. Choice a) The caste system was a purely social construct that reflected its time period. This statement is not supported by the passage, as it describes the caste system as being created by the sacrifice of Purusa.
Choice b) The caste system was encouraged by regional princes to reinforce social stability. This statement is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention regional princes or social stability.
Choice c) The caste system reinforced Indian identity in the face of Muslim invaders. This statement is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention Muslim invaders.
Choice d) The caste system was integral to the Hindu religion, transcending historical eras. This statement is supported by the passage, as it describes the caste system as being created by the sacrifice of Purusa, which is a part of the Hindu religion.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

North Atlantic Treaty, April 4, 1949
The North Atlantic Treaty in the passage above most clearly supports which of the following concepts? Choices: a) Capitalism b) Collective defense c) Mutually assured destruction d) Communism 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of the North Atlantic Treaty. The treaty is focused on promoting peace and security in the North Atlantic area.
Next, I need to analyze the specific articles of the treaty to understand its main concept. Article 1 emphasizes the use of peaceful means to settle international disputes, while Article 2 promotes economic collaboration and stability. However, Article 5 is the most relevant to the question, as it outlines the collective defense mechanism in case of an armed attack.
Article 5 states that an armed attack against one or more member states shall be considered an attack against all member states, and that each member state will assist the attacked state by taking necessary action, including the use of armed force. This collective defense mechanism is a key concept of the North Atlantic Treaty.

Questions to the passage below, an account given to a French officer in Algeria in the 1830s by a member of an Arab slave trade caravan.
The Slave Trade
All of you [soldiers], are summoned... to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""].... The soldiery divided themselves into two companies... with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields.... Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beardâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negressâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negroâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.30,000 cowries
A young Negress â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦50â€“60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro childâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.35â€“40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women.... It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own.... Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk.... They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.
Which statement best supports the argument that religion played a role in the Arab slave trade? Choices: a) Seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields b) With orders to attack places without defenses c) Four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women d) All of you soldiers, are summoned... to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes 
Output:
First, I need to identify the statement that mentions religion. The passage mentions ""idolatrous Koholanes,"" which implies that the Arab slave trade was motivated by religious beliefs.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

""The greatest contribution that Africa can make to the peace of the world is to avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity, by creating a political union which will also by its success, stand as an example to a divided world. A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.""
Kwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961
The passage is most clearly an example of which of the following? Choices: a) Responses to failed unification attempts in Africa b) A plea for the United Nations to intervene in Africa c) A proposal to increase the standing of Africa in the modern world d) Ardent opposition to the influence of capitalism in Africa 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of the passage. The passage is talking about the importance of African unity and how it can benefit the continent and the world.
Next, I need to analyze the language and tone used in the passage. The language is formal and persuasive, and the tone is optimistic and encouraging.
Now, I need to consider the options and determine which one best fits the main idea and tone of the passage. Option c) A proposal to increase the standing of Africa in the modern world is the most fitting, as the passage argues that African unity can help the continent gain more respect and influence in the world.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.
William Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, ""On the Suppression of Sati,"" 1829
I have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].
George Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826
The first passage can be said to undermine which commonly held assumption about Western imperialism? Choices: a) That European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices b) That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits c) That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations d) That European colonizers often resorted to armed force to impose their will on imperial subjects 
Output:
First, I need to identify the commonly held assumption about Western imperialism that the first passage is likely to undermine. The passage discusses the decision to continue or discontinue the practice of sati, which is a native religious practice, and the Governor-General of India expresses concern about the potential consequences of interfering with it.
Next, I need to consider the tone and language used in the passage. The Governor-General's language is cautious and hesitant, and he expresses a sense of responsibility and horror at the prospect of interfering with the practice of sati.
Now, I need to compare the tone and language used in the passage with the commonly held assumptions about Western imperialism. The passage suggests that European colonizers were not uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations, and that they sometimes expressed concern about the potential consequences of interfering with native practices.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

Know the self to be sitting in the chariot, the body to be the chariot, the intellect the charioteer, and the mind the reins. He who has understanding, who is mindful and always pure, indeed reaches that place from whence he is not born again.
from the Upanishads, India, circa 600sâ€“400s B.C.E.
Compared to the message communicated by the excerpt, Buddhist doctrine regarding reincarnation most resembled Hinduism in that it Choices: a) retained the concept of karma. b) proposed a heavenly existence after death. c) rejected the validity of all gods. d) mandated unquestioning obedience to the priestly class. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the main idea of the excerpt, which is the concept of self and the path to enlightenment. The excerpt describes the self as sitting in a chariot, with the body as the chariot, the intellect as the charioteer, and the mind as the reins. This metaphor suggests a sense of control and agency over one's own life.
Next, I need to compare this idea to the Buddhist doctrine regarding reincarnation. Buddhist doctrine emphasizes the concept of karma, which holds that an individual's actions in this life will determine their circumstances in the next life. This idea is similar to the concept of karma in Hinduism, which also holds that an individual's actions in this life will determine their circumstances in the next life.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices. Choice a) retained the concept of karma is the correct answer because Buddhist doctrine, like Hinduism, emphasizes the concept of karma. Choice b) proposed a heavenly existence after death is incorrect because Buddhist doctrine does not emphasize a heavenly existence after death. Choice c) rejected the validity of all gods is incorrect because Buddhist doctrine does not reject the validity of all gods. Choice d) mandated unquestioning obedience to the priestly class is incorrect because Buddhist doctrine does not mandate unquestioning obedience to the priestly class.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

""To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat herâ€“â€“because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploitersâ€“â€“to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weakâ€“â€“therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved.

Joseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931
Stalin's speech is most strongly influenced by which of the following? Choices: a) Appeasement b) Fascism c) Communism d) Secret treaties 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of Stalin's speech. The speech is about the need for Russia to modernize and catch up with other countries, and to avoid being beaten or exploited by more powerful nations.
Next, I need to analyze the language and tone of the speech. The speech uses strong and emotive language, emphasizing the need for Russia to be strong and self-sufficient, and to avoid being weak and backward.
Now, I need to consider the historical context of the speech. The speech was delivered in 1931, during the early years of the Soviet Union, and at a time when the country was still recovering from the devastation of the Russian Civil War.
Based on this analysis, I would say that Stalin's speech is most strongly influenced by Communism. The speech emphasizes the need for collective action and cooperation, and for the Soviet Union to be a strong and self-sufficient nation. The speech also reflects the Marxist idea that the working class must be united and strong in order to overcome the exploitation of the capitalist class.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

On whom therefore is the labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering this territory incumbent, if not upon you? You, upon whom above other nations God has conferred remarkable glory in arms, great courage, bodily activity, and strength to humble the hairy scalp of those who resist you.
Let the deeds of your ancestors move you and incite your minds to manly achievements; the glory and greatness of king Charles the Great, and of his son Louis, and of your other kings, who have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans, and extended in these lands the territory of the holy church. Let the holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior, which is possessed by unclean nations, especially incite you, and the holy places which are now treated with ignominy and irreverently polluted with their filthiness. Oh, most valiant soldiers and descendants of invincible ancestors, be not degenerate, but recall the valor of your progenitors.
Jerusalem is the navel of the world; the land is fruitful above others, like another paradise of delights. This the Redeemer of the human race has made illustrious by His advent, has beautified by residence, has consecrated by suffering, has redeemed by death, has glorified by burial. This royal city, therefore, situated at the center of the world, is now held captive by His enemies, and is in subjection to those who do not know God, to the worship of the heathens. She seeks therefore and desires to be liberated and does not cease to implore you to come to her aid. From you especially she asks succor, because, as we have already said, God has conferred upon you above all nations great glory in arms. Accordingly undertake this journey for the remission of your sins, with the assurance of the imperishable glory of the kingdom of heaven.""
Pope Urban II, Speech at the Council of Clermont as recorded by Robert the Monk, 1095 C.E.
Which of the following events was most directly the result of the speech presented above? Choices: a) The failure of any Christian campaign to reclaim the Levant b) The decline of Mediterranean trade routes c) The conquest of Constantinople by Latin Christians d) The decisive defeat of the Seljuk Turks by Byzantine forces 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main purpose of the speech. The speech is a call to arms, urging the nobles and knights of Europe to join a military campaign to reclaim the Holy Land from Muslim rule.
Next, I need to consider the historical context. The speech was delivered by Pope Urban II at the Council of Clermont in 1095, and it marked the beginning of the First Crusade.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) is incorrect because the speech was actually a call to action, not a prediction of failure. Option b) is also incorrect because the speech did not mention trade routes. Option d) is incorrect because the speech did not mention the Seljuk Turks specifically, and the decisive defeat of the Seljuk Turks by Byzantine forces did not occur until the 11th century.
The correct answer is option c) because the conquest of Constantinople by Latin Christians was a direct result of the speech, which called for the liberation of the Holy Land and the defeat of Muslim forces. The Fourth Crusade, which took place in 1204, resulted in the sack of Constantinople and the establishment of a Latin Empire. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

Which style of government is most associated with limited regulations on business and working conditions similar to those described in the passage? Choices: a) Laissez-faire b) Totalitarian c) Utilitarian d) Corporatist 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key characteristics of the government style being asked about. The passage describes a system with limited regulations on business and working conditions, where children are allowed to work in factories under poor conditions due to necessity.
Next, I need to consider the characteristics of each government style option. Laissez-faire is a economic system that advocates for minimal government intervention in the economy, which would lead to limited regulations on business and working conditions. Totalitarian is a system where the government has complete control over all aspects of society, which would likely lead to more regulations, not less. Utilitarian is a system that aims to maximize overall happiness, but it does not necessarily imply limited regulations on business and working conditions. Corporatist is a system where the government works closely with corporations, which could lead to more regulations, not less.
Now, I need to determine which government style is most associated with limited regulations on business and working conditions similar to those described in the passage. Based on the characteristics of each style, I conclude that the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

By what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land!

Lin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839
Which of the outcomes listed below followed the delivery of Lin Zexu's letter? Choices: a) Chinese naval defeat and new trade terms more favorable to the West b) A successful ban of the opium trade in all Chinese territories c) Violent uprisings on the part of China's pro-British Muslim minority d) The expulsion of all foreigners from Chinese territory 
Output:
First, I need to identify the historical context of the letter. Lin Zexu was a Chinese trade commissioner who wrote to Queen Victoria in 1839, during the First Opium War.
Next, I need to understand the content of the letter. Lin Zexu is arguing against the opium trade, which was a major issue at the time, and is criticizing the British for their role in it.
Now, I need to consider the possible outcomes of the letter. The First Opium War was a conflict between China and the British Empire, and it was sparked by the British desire to continue the opium trade.
Considering the historical context and the content of the letter, I can eliminate options b and d. The letter was not a call for a ban of the opium trade in all Chinese territories, and it did not advocate for the expulsion of all foreigners from Chinese territory.
Between options a and c, I can eliminate option c. The letter does not mention the pro-British Muslim minority, and there is no evidence to suggest that violent uprisings on their part were a consequence of the letter.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight.... The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military... was relaxed... ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.
â€”Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon
The author of the above passage claims: ""Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest."" What does he mean by this? Choices: a) The rulers became too rich and thus were overthrown. b) The empire became too large to control effectively. c) Decay begins the minute something begins to grow. d) Conquest and prosperity are mutually exclusive. 
Output:
First, I need to understand what the author means by ""the principle of decay."" The author is suggesting that the very success of the Roman Empire led to its downfall. This is a common theme in history, where the very factors that contribute to an empire's growth and prosperity can also lead to its decline.
Next, I need to consider what the author means by ""the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest."" The author is suggesting that as the Roman Empire expanded its territories through conquest, it also created new problems and challenges that ultimately contributed to its decline. This could include the strain on resources, the difficulty of maintaining control over a large and diverse territory, and the potential for rebellion and resistance from conquered peoples.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices. Choice a) suggests that the rulers became too rich and were overthrown, but this is not what the author is saying. The author is talking about the empire as a whole, not just the rulers. Choice c) suggests that decay begins the minute something begins to grow, but this is a simplistic and overly broad interpretation of the author's statement. Choice d) suggests that conquest and prosperity are mutually exclusive, but this is not what the author is saying. The author is saying that the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest, not that conquest and prosperity are impossible together.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

Which of the following inferences best explains the reason the King of Portugal insisted on Portuguese control of territory east of the demarcation line? Choices: a) Portuguese explorers were convinced that the route to the New World was easier traveled by going east. b) The Portuguese desired to continue the crusades against the Mamelukes who controlled the Holy Land. c) The Portuguese desired control of the wealthy lands of Mexico. d) The Portuguese knew of a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope in the south of Africa. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the Treaty of Tordesillas. The treaty was signed in 1494 between the King of Portugal and the King of Spain, and it established a demarcation line in the Atlantic Ocean to divide the New World between the two powers.
Next, I need to analyze the reasons behind the King of Portugal's insistence on controlling territory east of the demarcation line. The treaty states that the line was drawn 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, and all lands discovered east of this line would belong to Portugal.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) suggests that the Portuguese explorers believed the route to the New World was easier traveled by going east, but this is not supported by historical evidence. Option b) mentions the crusades against the Mamelukes, but this is not relevant to the Treaty of Tordesillas. Option c) refers to the wealthy lands of Mexico, but the treaty does not mention Mexico. Option d) mentions the route to India via the Cape of Good Hope, which is a well-documented historical fact. The Portuguese had been searching for a sea route to India since the 15th century, and the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 by Bartolomeu Dias was a major milestone in this endeavor.

Both authors below were speaking of the French Revolution.
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other wayâ€”in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

One similarity between the French Revolution and the American Revolution is that both were responses to which of the following? Choices: a) Transformation of the social class structure b) Unfair systems of taxation c) New proposed political structures d) The privileges and influence of religious leaders 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements of the French Revolution and the American Revolution. The French Revolution was a time of great change and upheaval, marked by the overthrow of the monarchy and the rise of the middle class. The American Revolution was also a time of great change, marked by the colonies' fight for independence from Great Britain.
Next, I need to consider the possible answers and determine which one is most closely related to both revolutions. Option a) Transformation of the social class structure is a key element of the French Revolution, as the revolution was driven in part by the desire to overthrow the aristocracy and establish a more equal society. Option b) Unfair systems of taxation is also a key element of the American Revolution, as the colonies were subject to taxation without representation and this was a major factor in the lead-up to the revolution.
Now, I need to consider the other options and determine if they are also relevant to both revolutions. Option c) New proposed political structures is not a key element of the American Revolution, as the colonies were already established as a democratic republic. Option d) The privileges and influence of religious leaders is not a key element of either revolution, as both were primarily secular in nature.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!
What's this that you have done?
Is 't not a very naughty thing
To snatch the kaiser's crown?
Now you will have to stay away
Alike from Rhine and Prague,
And more than that-shame and dismay
Your days and nights will plague.
Right well you knew, and all the world,
Right well they know this thing,
That Ferdinand alone can be
Bohemia's lawful king.
So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go
To Ferdinand, your king,
And beg him graciously to show
Full pardon for your sin.
""Poor Winter King,"" seventeenth-century song
Which of the following events inspired the composition of this song? Choices: a) Peace of Augsburg b) War of Spanish Succession c) Edict of Nantes d) Thirty Years' War 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements in the song that might indicate the historical event that inspired it. The song mentions the ""Winter King,"" which is a reference to Frederick V, the Elector Palatine who was crowned King of Bohemia in 1619. It also mentions the ""kaiser's crown,"" which refers to the Holy Roman Emperor, and the fact that Frederick will have to stay away from Rhine and Prague.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the time period. The Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) was a devastating conflict that involved many European powers, including the Holy Roman Empire, the Habsburgs, and the Protestant states of Germany. Frederick V was a key figure in this conflict, and his coronation as King of Bohemia in 1619 was a major event that sparked the war.
Now, I need to evaluate the options and determine which one is most closely related to the events described in the song. The Peace of Augsburg (1555) was a treaty that established the principle of cuius regio, eius religio, which allowed each state to determine its own religion. While this treaty was an important event in the history of the Holy Roman Empire, it is not directly related to the events described in the song. The War of Spanish Succession (1701-1714) was a conflict that took place more than 80 years after the events described in the song, and the Edict of Nantes (1598) was a decree that granted toleration to Protestants in France, but it is not directly related to the events described in the song.

Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, March 25, 1824
Taken together, the two sources best illustrate which of the following aspects of political philosophy in the period circa 1750â€“1900 C.E.? Choices: a) Constitutions around the world decreed representative governments for their citizens. b) Monarchs exerted a great deal of influence in their nations' governments. c) Military dictatorships often supplanted democratic governments. d) Industrialization propelled societies to demand more social obligations from their governments. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the two sources to understand their content. Source 1 refers to the Fundamental Law Establishing Gran Colombia, which was passed by the Congress of Angostura convened by Simon Bolivar in 1819. This document outlines the unification of the Republics of Venezuela and New Granada under the title of Republic of Colombia. It establishes the executive power of the republic and the role of the president and vice president.
Next, I need to examine Source 2, which refers to the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, passed in 1824. This document outlines the structure of the government, the territory, and the religion of the empire. It establishes a hereditary monarchy with a constitutional and representative government.
Now, I need to consider the aspects of political philosophy in the period circa 1750â€“1900 C.E. that are illustrated by the two sources. I notice that both sources refer to the establishment of a government structure, but they differ in their approach. Source 1 establishes a republic with a representative government, while Source 2 establishes a hereditary monarchy with a constitutional and representative government.

This great purity of the French Revolution is precisely what causes both our strength and our weakness. Our strength, because it gives to us rights of the public interest over private interests; our weakness, because it rallies all vicious men against us. We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or perish with it; now in this situation, the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror. Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible; it is therefore an emanation of virtue; it is not so much a special principle as it is a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to our country's most urgent needs.
French revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre, 1794
The passage above appears to articulate which of the following political principles? Choices: a) From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs b) Might makes right c) The end justifies the means d) The government is best that governs least 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key phrases in the passage that relate to political principles. The passage mentions ""rights of the public interest over private interests,"" which suggests a focus on the collective good over individual interests.
Next, I need to consider the context in which these phrases are used. The passage is written by Maximilien Robespierre, a French revolutionary leader, during the Reign of Terror, a period of extreme violence and repression.
Now, I need to analyze the specific phrases used in the passage. The phrase ""lead the people by reason"" suggests a commitment to rational decision-making and the common good. The phrase ""lead the people's enemies by terror"" suggests a willingness to use force and coercion to achieve political goals.
Based on this analysis, I can conclude that the passage articulates the principle that ""the end justifies the means."" This principle is often associated with a utilitarian or pragmatic approach to politics, where the goal of achieving a desired outcome is seen as more important than the methods used to achieve it.

First, I need to understand the context of the question. The letter from the Ottoman Sultan to the Safavid Shah mentions the Safavids' actions as a reason for the ire of other Islamic empires.
Next, I need to analyze the options given. Option a) mentions the Safavids' geographical location, but this is not mentioned in the letter as a reason for the ire of other empires.
Option b) mentions the Safavids' rejection of central tenets of Islam, but the letter does not mention this as a reason for the ire of other empires.
Option c) mentions the Safavids' enslavement of Christians and turning them into fighters, but the letter does not mention this as a reason for the ire of other empires.
Option d) mentions Ismail's proclamation of himself as a Caliph, but the letter does not mention this as a reason for the ire of other empires.

The author of the above passage was most associated with which of the following movements? Choices: a) Existentialism b) Religious fundamentalism c) New age syncretism d) Liberation theology 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key concepts in the passage. The passage mentions the idea of meaning transcending human condition, and the author's uncertainty about the meaning of the world.
Next, I need to consider the characteristics of each movement. Existentialism emphasizes individual freedom and choice, and often questions the meaning of life. Religious fundamentalism emphasizes the literal interpretation of religious texts, and often rejects uncertainty. New age syncretism emphasizes the blending of different spiritual practices, and often emphasizes personal growth. Liberation theology emphasizes the role of faith in social justice, and often emphasizes the importance of community.
Now, I need to consider which movement is most closely associated with the author's ideas. The author's emphasis on individual freedom and choice, and his uncertainty about the meaning of the world, are most closely associated with existentialism.

""Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.""

The political philosophy espoused in the text above is different from those of the medieval period in which of the following ways? Choices: a) It accepted the notion that monarchs were justified in asserting their authority. b) It was a pragmatic rather than an ethical or religious ideology. c) It stressed the importance of looking back to the classical past. d) It did not rely upon strong concepts of equality across class boundaries. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the main idea of the text. The text discusses the political philosophy of Nicolo Machiavelli, who argues that it is safer to be feared than loved by your subjects. He also states that people are ungrateful and fickle, and that friendships obtained by payments are not secure.
Next, I need to compare the political philosophy of Machiavelli with those of the medieval period. During the medieval period, political philosophy was often based on religious and ethical principles, such as the idea that monarchs were divinely appointed and that their authority was justified by God.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices. Choice a) is incorrect because Machiavelli's philosophy does not accept the notion that monarchs are justified in asserting their authority based on divine right. Choice c) is also incorrect because Machiavelli's philosophy does not stress the importance of looking back to the classical past. Choice d) is incorrect because Machiavelli's philosophy does not rely on strong concepts of equality across class boundaries.

Which of the following best accounts for the spread of Islam to the lands of the kingdom of Mali? Choices: a) Muslim missionaries who came from Southern Africa. b) Trade contacts who came from the north across the Sahara. c) Berber armies who conquered the former kingdom of Ghana. d) Pressure from Christian Ethiopia caused the king of Mali to seek Muslim allies. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the geographical location of the kingdom of Mali. It is located in West Africa, and the Sahara Desert is to its north.
Next, I need to consider the information provided by Al' Umari, which mentions trade contacts between the kingdom of Mali and the land of the pagan Sudan. This suggests that there were interactions between the kingdom of Mali and the Muslim world.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) is unlikely because there is no evidence of Muslim missionaries coming from Southern Africa. Option c) is also unlikely because the Berber armies conquered the former kingdom of Ghana, but there is no evidence that they conquered the kingdom of Mali. Option d) is unlikely because there is no evidence of pressure from Christian Ethiopia on the kingdom of Mali.
Therefore, the most plausible explanation for the spread of Islam to the kingdom of Mali is trade contacts with the Muslim world, which is option b).

""Purusa-Sukta""
Purusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.
It was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.
When they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.

As for their men there is no sexual jealousy in them. And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons.... They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.
â€”Adapted from an account by Ibn Battuta of his travels in Mali during the 1300s
What was the likely cause of women not wearing the veil? Choices: a) They were probably rebelling against the oppression of women in Islam. b) It was a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern. c) As sexual objects, they were prevented from veiling themselves. d) The climate of Mali makes veiling women impractical. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context in which the women were living. The passage mentions that the women were Muslims and kept to the prayers, studied Islamic jurisprudence, and learned the Qur'an by heart. This suggests that they were adhering to Islamic practices.
Next, I need to examine the specific behavior of the women. The passage states that the women were not modest in the presence of men and did not veil themselves, despite their adherence to Islamic practices. This suggests that the women's behavior was not a rebellion against Islam, but rather a deviation from the typical practice of veiling.
Now, I need to consider the cultural context of Mali during the 1300s. The passage mentions that the women had friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage, and that the men also had companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. This suggests that the society was relatively permissive and that the women's behavior was not unusual.
Therefore, the likely cause of the women not wearing the veil was a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern. {'sol': 'b'}"

Choices: a) Pressure on colonial powers by the Soviet Union to retreat from their colonies b) The Great Depression that started in 1929 c) The decolonization process already underway in Africa d) World War II 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements of the text that are relevant to the question. The text mentions a boycott of foreign cloth and the importance of spinning or weaving during every spare minute. It also mentions the goal of Swadeshi, which is the promotion of Indian industry and the boycott of foreign goods.
Next, I need to consider the historical context in which the boycott was taking place. The text was written in 1921, during the Non-Cooperation Movement, a period of mass civil disobedience against British rule in India.
Now, I need to evaluate the options in light of this context. Option a) is incorrect because the Soviet Union did not exert significant pressure on colonial powers to retreat from their colonies until the 1950s. Option b) is also incorrect because the Great Depression did not start until 1929, and it would not have had a significant impact on the boycott in 1921. Option c) is incorrect because decolonization in Africa was not underway in 1921. Option d) is the correct answer because World War II created a global economic crisis that weakened the British economy and made it more difficult for them to maintain their colonial rule in India.

from The Maxims of Ptahhotep, Egypt, ca. 2400 B.C.E.
The above texts are best understood in the context of which of the following? Choices: a) The use of religion to justify gender relations b) The use of religion to enforce legal norms c) The use of religion to ponder conceptions of the afterlife d) The use of religion to explain social hierarchy 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the texts provided. The texts appear to be ancient wisdom or maxims from the Epic of Gilgamesh and The Maxims of Ptahhotep. They discuss the importance of truth, the consequences of wrongdoing, and the guidance of the gods.
Next, I need to analyze the content of the texts. The texts emphasize the value of truth and the consequences of transgressing its ordinances. They also mention the guidance of the gods and the idea that those who are guided by the gods cannot lose themselves.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) The use of religion to justify gender relations is not relevant to the texts, as they do not discuss gender relations. Option b) The use of religion to enforce legal norms is also not relevant, as the texts do not discuss legal norms. Option c) The use of religion to ponder conceptions of the afterlife is not the primary focus of the texts, although they do mention the ""river of life"" which could be interpreted as a reference to the afterlife. Option d) The use of religion to explain social hierarchy is not the primary focus of the texts, although they do mention the idea that those who are guided by the gods cannot lose themselves, which could be interpreted as a reference to social hierarchy.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on.
A soldier says simply: ""They call up more every day.
""Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
""But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.""
Du Fu, ""Ballad of the Army Carts,"" ca. 750 C.E.
The poem provides evidence of which of the following as a major cause of later Tang decline? Choices: a) Discontent among the peasantry due to oppressive taxation b) Foreign invasion of the Tang heartlands c) The spread of Buddhism and Taoism as a reaction to state-sponsored Confucianism d) An ineffective bureaucracy and poor leadership 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main theme of the poem. The poem describes the hardships faced by soldiers and the peasants, particularly in the Shanxi region. The soldiers are forced to fight in distant lands, and the peasants are burdened with heavy taxes and the loss of their sons to military service.
Next, I need to analyze the causes of these hardships. The poem mentions the ""District Officers"" demanding the land tax, which suggests that the government is imposing heavy taxes on the peasants. This is likely causing discontent among the peasantry.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) Discontent among the peasantry due to oppressive taxation is a plausible cause of later Tang decline. The poem provides evidence of the peasants' suffering under the tax burden, which could lead to widespread discontent and potentially contribute to the decline of the Tang dynasty.
Option b) Foreign invasion of the Tang heartlands is not supported by the poem, as it does not mention any foreign invasions.
Option c) The spread of Buddhism and Taoism as a reaction to state-sponsored Confucianism is not mentioned in the poem, and it is not clear how this would be a major cause of Tang decline.
Option d) An ineffective bureaucracy and poor leadership is not directly mentioned in the poem, but it could be inferred as a contributing factor to the peasants' suffering and the government's inability to address their concerns.

Instructions from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo, 1512
The tone of the first letter best reflects which of the following developments in early modern Africa? Choices: a) A growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods b) Vigorous resistance to European expeditions of conquest c) The establishment of Portuguese trading posts along the coastline d) The consolidation of states along the Atlantic coast of Africa 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements of the tone of the King Afonso I's letter. The letter expresses a sense of frustration and concern about the treatment of Kongolese people by Portuguese traders, particularly the kidnapping and enslavement of noblemen and other individuals.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the letter. The letter was written in 1526, a time when European expeditions of conquest were becoming more common in Africa.
Now, I need to evaluate the options in light of the tone and context of the letter. Option a) A growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods does not seem to be reflected in the tone of the letter, which is more focused on the negative consequences of trade with Europe. Option c) The establishment of Portuguese trading posts along the coastline is also not directly related to the tone of the letter. Option d) The consolidation of states along the Atlantic coast of Africa is not mentioned in the letter.
Therefore, the tone of the letter best reflects option b) Vigorous resistance to European expeditions of conquest, as the King expresses his frustration with the negative consequences of European trade and conquest in his kingdom.

Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, March 25, 1824
Which of the following is most directly responsible for creating the constitutions above? Choices: a) Nationalist movements advocating pan-Americanism b) Revolts organized by provincial elites in Latin American nations c) Aboriginal natives gathering the support of provincials to create constitutions d) Colonial powers preparing their colonies for independence 
Output:
First, I need to identify the historical context of the two constitutions. The Fundamental Law Establishing Gran Colombia was passed in 1819, during the Latin American wars of independence. This was a time of nationalist movements and revolts against Spanish colonial rule.
The Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, on the other hand, was passed in 1824, after Brazil had already gained independence from Portugal in 1822.
Next, I need to consider the role of nationalist movements in the creation of these constitutions. Nationalist movements were a key factor in the Latin American wars of independence, and the Fundamental Law Establishing Gran Colombia was a product of these movements.
However, the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil was created after Brazil had already gained independence, and it was more focused on establishing a new imperial government rather than fighting for independence.
Now, I need to consider the role of provincial elites in the creation of these constitutions. Provincial elites played a significant role in the Latin American wars of independence, and the Fundamental Law Establishing Gran Colombia was passed by the Congress of Angostura, which was convened by Simon Bolivar and consisted of representatives from various provinces.
The Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, on the other hand, was passed by the Emperor Dom Pedro I, who was a member of the imperial family and not a provincial elite.
Therefore, the most direct responsibility for creating the constitutions above lies with the nationalist movements advocating pan-Americanism, which were a key factor in the Latin American wars of independence and the creation of the Fundamental Law Establishing Gran Colombia.

Which independent African state will claim that its financial structure and banking institutions are fully harnessed to its national development? Which will claim that its material resources and human energies are available for its own national aspirations?

Which of the following factors was most important in preventing the fulfillment of the political dreams described in the passage? Choices: a) A lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion b) The spread of communism throughout the continent c) Armed intervention on the part of the Cold War superpowers d) Africa's shortage of natural resources 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of the passage. The passage is about the importance of unity among African states for their progress and contribution to world peace.
Next, I need to analyze the factors that could prevent the fulfillment of the political dreams described in the passage. The passage mentions that political independence is not enough to rid Africa of the consequences of colonial rule, and that the continent has been too busy nursing its separate states to understand the need for union.
The passage does not mention a lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion (choice a) as a factor preventing unity. It also does not mention the spread of communism (choice b) or armed intervention by the Cold War superpowers (choice c) as factors preventing unity. The passage does mention that Africa has been too busy nursing its separate states, which suggests that the continent's shortage of natural resources (choice d) is not the main factor preventing unity.
However, the passage does not explicitly mention the shortage of natural resources as a factor preventing unity. It does mention that the continent's material resources and human energies are available for its own national aspirations, which suggests that the shortage of natural resources is not the main factor preventing unity.
The passage does mention that the continent has been too busy nursing its separate states, which suggests that the main factor preventing unity is the lack of a common purpose, common planning, and common endeavour among African states.

Based on your knowledge of world history, which of the following contributed LEAST to Western European global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.? Choices: a) The exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe b) Refinement of gunpowder technologies c) The development and application of steam-powered technologies d) The implementation of joint-stock companies 
Output:
First, I need to identify the time period in question, which is between 1450 and 1750 C.E.
Next, I need to consider the factors that contributed to Western European global hegemony during this time period. The exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe, such as maize and potatoes, had a significant impact on population growth and economic development in Europe.
The refinement of gunpowder technologies, such as the development of more efficient firearms and artillery, played a crucial role in Western European military conquests and the expansion of their empires.
The implementation of joint-stock companies, such as the Dutch East India Company and the British East India Company, facilitated trade and commerce between Europe and other parts of the world, contributing to Western European economic growth and global influence.
Now, I need to consider the option that contributed LEAST to Western European global hegemony during this time period. The development and application of steam-powered technologies did not occur until the Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century. Therefore, it did not contribute to Western European global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.

""We are not Europeans; we are not Indians; we are but a mixed species of aborigines and Spaniards.

Thus our position is most extraordinary and complicated. But there is more. As our role has always been strictly passive and political existence nil, we find that our quest for liberty is now even more difficult of accomplishment; for we, having been placed in a state lower than slavery, had been robbed not only of our freedom but also of the right to exercise an active domestic tyrannyâ€¦We have been ruled more by deceit than by force, and we have been degraded more by vice than by superstition.

The passage is best understood in the context of which of the following political movements? Choices: a) The fight for workers' rights in Central America b) The fight for independence in South America c) The fight for economic justice in the Caribbean d) The fight for political autonomy in the Philippines 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements of the passage. The passage mentions the struggle for liberty, the conflict with natives, and the struggle to maintain oneself in the country of birth against the opposition of invaders. It also mentions the role of deceit, vice, and superstition in the degradation of the people.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the passage. The passage was written by SimÃ³n de BolÃ­var, a key figure in the fight for independence in South America. The language and tone of the passage suggest a struggle for national liberation, rather than a struggle for workers' rights, economic justice, or political autonomy.
Finally, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) is incorrect because the passage does not mention workers' rights. Option c) is incorrect because the passage does not mention economic justice. Option d) is incorrect because the passage does not mention the Philippines. Option b) is the most plausible option because the passage mentions the struggle for independence in South America and the conflict with natives.

The passage below is the Chinese emperor's response to English King George III's diplomatic envoys, who were seeking expanded trading privileges (1793).
Strange and costly objects do not interest me. If I have commanded that the tribute offerings sent by you, O King, are to be accepted, this was solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar.... As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures. It behooves you, O King, to display even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity.
What was the impact of European demand for Chinese goods? Choices: a) The Portuguese increased their international power and prestige. b) The British shifted their focus for trade and colonization to Japan. c) The bulk of the world's silver supply moved to China. d) The British sought control of the Malacca Strait. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. The passage is a response from the Chinese emperor to English King George III's diplomatic envoys, who were seeking expanded trading privileges.
Next, I need to analyze the content of the passage. The emperor states that he has no interest in European objects, including those from the British, and that he values loyalty and submission over trade.
Now, I need to consider the historical context of European demand for Chinese goods. During the 18th century, European powers, including the British, were seeking to expand their trade with China, particularly in tea, silk, and porcelain.
The emperor's response suggests that he was not interested in expanding trade with the British, and that he valued loyalty and submission over trade. This suggests that the British did not gain significant trading privileges with China.
However, the passage does not mention the Portuguese, Japan, or the Malacca Strait. Therefore, I can eliminate choices a, b, and d.
The passage does mention the movement of goods, specifically the emperor's statement that ""we possess all things."" This suggests that China was a major supplier of goods, and that the bulk of the world's silver supply may have moved to China in exchange for these goods.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

The observations expressed in the excerpt are best seen as evidence for which of the following in Yuan China? Choices: a) Policies of religious toleration b) Instatement of foreigners as provincial administrators c) Mongol assimilation into Chinese culture d) Military pressures from internal unrest 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key points in the excerpt. Ibn Battuta mentions that the Chinese are infidels, but he also notes that the King of China is a Tartar and a descendant of Genghis Khan, indicating that the Mongols were in power. He also mentions that there are many Muslims in the city of Hangzhou, and that they have their own mosques and are treated with honor.
Next, I need to consider the context of Yuan China. The Yuan dynasty was a Mongol dynasty that ruled China from 1271 to 1368. During this time, the Mongols implemented policies of religious toleration, allowing people of different religions to practice their faiths freely.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) Policies of religious toleration is supported by the excerpt, as Ibn Battuta notes that the Muslims are treated with honor and have their own mosques. Option b) Instatement of foreigners as provincial administrators is not supported, as there is no mention of foreigners being appointed as administrators. Option c) Mongol assimilation into Chinese culture is not supported, as the excerpt suggests that the Mongols were still in power and that the Chinese were infidels. Option d) Military pressures from internal unrest is not supported, as there is no mention of internal unrest or military pressures.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

First, I need to understand the context of the quote. Kwame Nkrumah is advocating for a political union of African states to promote peace and unity.
Next, I need to identify the reason why Nkrumah feels Africa must avoid disunity. He mentions that disunity will lead to a ""callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.""
Now, I need to analyze the options. Option a) suggests that unity is necessary for independence, but Nkrumah is already assuming that African nations are independent. Option b) implies that disunity is a historical issue, but Nkrumah is focusing on the present and future. Option c) mentions civil wars, but Nkrumah does not mention this in the quote. Option d) aligns with Nkrumah's statement that the world community sees power as a function of size and influence, and that a unified Africa will command respect.

Output:
First, I need to consider the context of the question. The historian is sympathetic to Soviet communism, which means they are likely to have a positive view of the Soviet regime.
Next, I need to analyze the chart. The literacy rate increases significantly over time, from 24% in 1897 to 99.90% in 1955. This suggests that the Soviet regime had a positive impact on education and literacy.
Now, I need to consider the options. Option a) is incorrect because it suggests that the Soviet regime failed to achieve its ideals, which is the opposite of what the chart suggests. Option b) is also incorrect because the chart does not provide any information about military preparedness. Option c) is incorrect because the chart only provides information about Russia, not China. Option d) is the most likely correct answer because it acknowledges the abuses of Lenin and Stalin while still highlighting the significant achievements of the Soviet regime.

""Upon their arrival they were honorably and graciously received by the grand Khan, in a full assembly of his principal officers. When they drew nigh to his person, they paid their respects by prostrating themselves on the floor. He immediately commanded them to rise, and to relate to him the circumstances of their travels, with all that had taken place in their negotiation with his holiness the pope. To their narrative, which they gave in the regular order of events, and delivered in perspicuous language, he listened with attentive silence. The letters and the presents from pope Gregory were then laid before him, and, upon hearing the former read, he bestowed much commendation on the fidelity, the zeal, and the diligence of his ambassadors; and receiving with due reverence the oil from the holy sepulchre, he gave directions that it should be preserved with religious care. Upon his observing Marco Polo, and inquiring who he was, Nicolo made answer, This is your servant, and my son; upon which the grand Khan replied, ""He is welcome, and it pleases me much,"" and he caused him to be enrolled amongst his attendants of honor. And on account of their return he made a great feast and rejoicing; and as long as the said brothers and Marco remained in the court of the grand Khan, they were honored even above his own courtiers.

Choices: a) The economic dominance of the Ottoman Empire b) The influence of Middle Eastern religious beliefs on the peoples of South Asia c) The lack of cooperation among major political groups in the High Middle Ages d) Amiable cultural exchange between Europe and Asia 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements of the encounter described in the account. The grand Khan receives the ambassadors and their son Marco Polo with honor and respect, and they are treated as honored guests. The Khan listens to their narrative and commends their fidelity, zeal, and diligence. He also receives the presents and letters from the pope with due reverence.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the encounter. The account is set in the court of the grand Khan, which was the center of the Mongol Empire. The Mongols were known for their tolerance and openness to cultural exchange, and their empire stretched from China to Eastern Europe.
Now, I need to evaluate the options in light of the key elements and historical context. Option a) The economic dominance of the Ottoman Empire is incorrect because the Ottoman Empire did not exist until the 14th century, and the account is set in the 13th century. Option b) The influence of Middle Eastern religious beliefs on the peoples of South Asia is also incorrect because the account does not mention any religious beliefs or practices. Option c) The lack of cooperation among major political groups in the High Middle Ages is incorrect because the account describes a peaceful and cooperative encounter between the grand Khan and the ambassadors. Option d) Amiable cultural exchange between Europe and Asia is the most plausible option because the account describes a friendly and respectful encounter between the grand Khan and the ambassadors, and the Khan's willingness to receive the presents and letters from the pope.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

Choices: a) The first union of independent Latin American states b) The first military victory of the War of 1812 c) The first military victory of the Spanish-American War d) The first political coup by someone of mixed-race descent 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key events and accomplishments mentioned in the passage. The passage mentions that SimÃ³n de BolÃ­var is engaged in a dual conflict, disputing with the natives for titles of ownership and struggling to maintain himself in the country that gave him birth against the opposition of the invaders.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the passage. The passage is written in 1819, and it mentions the Congress of Angostura, which was a key event in the Latin American wars of independence.
Now, I need to evaluate the options based on the information in the passage. Option a) The first union of independent Latin American states is a plausible option, as the passage mentions the Congress of Angostura, which was a key event in the Latin American wars of independence. Option b) The first military victory of the War of 1812 is not relevant to the passage, as the War of 1812 was fought between the United States and the British Empire, and the passage is written from the perspective of a Latin American leader. Option c) The first military victory of the Spanish-American War is not relevant to the passage, as the Spanish-American War took place in 1898, more than 70 years after the passage was written. Option d) The first political coup by someone of mixed-race descent is not supported by the passage, as there is no mention of BolÃ­var's mixed-race descent being relevant to his accomplishments.

""The quicksilver mines of Huancavelica are where the poor Indians are so harshly punished, where they are tortured and so many Indians die; it is there that the noble caciques [headmen] of this kingdom are finished off and tortured. The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]â€¦.The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a yearâ€¦.
And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.
And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubinesâ€¦.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]â€¦at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.
There is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing himâ€¦.Even the protector of the Indians is useless;â€¦he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.""

Which of the following changes to the Spanish policies towards Native Americans occurred on account of the practices described in the passage? Choices: a) The replacement of native laborers in the mines with an almost exclusively African slave workforce b) The foundation of viceroyalties to allow for more effective royal administration of native relations c) The promulgation of royal decrees insisting on more humane treatment of the natives d) The enfranchisement of all natives by local Spanish elites in the colonies 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main issue described in the passage. The passage describes the harsh treatment of Native Americans in the mines, including torture, death, and exploitation.
Next, I need to consider the options and determine which one is a plausible response to the practices described in the passage. The passage suggests that the Spanish policies towards Native Americans were ineffective and allowed for exploitation, so it is unlikely that the correct answer would be the replacement of Native American laborers with African slaves (option a), as this would not address the issue of exploitation.
The passage also mentions the role of colonial officials in allowing the exploitation to continue, so it is unlikely that the correct answer would be the foundation of viceroyalties (option b), as this would not necessarily address the issue of corruption and exploitation.
The passage suggests that the Spanish policies towards Native Americans were ineffective and allowed for exploitation, so it is unlikely that the correct answer would be the enfranchisement of all natives (option d), as this would not address the issue of exploitation.
The passage suggests that the Spanish policies towards Native Americans were ineffective and allowed for exploitation, so it is likely that the correct answer would be the promulgation of royal decrees insisting on more humane treatment of the natives (option c), as this would be a plausible response to the practices described in the passage.

"Input: This question refers to the following information.
That day the Reverend Xuanzang was chosen from among all the monks. He had been a monk from infancy, and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitions. His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know.
â€¦
He looked to the West and prayed, ""I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures. If I am fated to have a disciple, may I be able to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King to come with me to the Vulture Peak. If I am not fated to have a disciple, and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good, then may I be unable to remove the seal."" When he had prayed he bowed again.
From Wu Chengen, Journey to the West, ca. 1590s
In which of the following ways does the excerpt above most complicate historians' understanding of the career of the Chinese monk and traveler Xuanzang? Choices: a) It highly fictionalizes the story of Xuanzang's accomplishments. b) It was written long after the time period in which Xuanzang lived. c) It casts doubt on the actual existence of Xuanzang. d) It is widely considered by scholars to be a forgery. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the historical context of the excerpt. The Journey to the West was written by Wu Chengen in the 1590s, more than 700 years after Xuanzang's time.
Next, I need to analyze the content of the excerpt. The story is presented in a fictionalized and fantastical way, with elements such as a divine Monkey King and a magical seal.
Now, I need to consider the potential impact of the excerpt on historians' understanding of Xuanzang's career. The fictionalized and fantastical elements of the story may lead historians to question the accuracy of the information presented.

As for their men there is no sexual jealousy in them. And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons.... They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.

The most likely source of Islam in Mali came from Choices: a) wandering Berber mystics. b) conquering Mughal armies. c) contact with Muslim trade caravans. d) pilgrims to Islamic shrines in Ethiopia. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the geographical location of Mali. Mali is a landlocked country in West Africa, and it is not directly connected to the Middle East or South Asia, where Islam originated.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of Mali. During the 1300s, Mali was a major center of trade, and it was an important hub for the trans-Saharan trade route, which connected West Africa to the Middle East and North Africa.
Now, I need to consider the options. Option a) wandering Berber mystics is unlikely, as Berbers are a group of people who live in North Africa, and there is no evidence of them traveling to Mali during the 1300s. Option b) conquering Mughal armies is also unlikely, as the Mughal Empire was located in South Asia, and it did not have any significant presence in West Africa during the 1300s. Option d) pilgrims to Islamic shrines in Ethiopia is also unlikely, as Ethiopia is a Christian country, and it is not a major center of Islam.

""We are not Europeans; we are not Indians; we are but a mixed species of aborigines and Spaniards. Americans by birth and Europeans by law, we find ourselves engaged in a dual conflict: we are disputing with the natives for titles of ownership, and at the same time we are struggling to maintain ourselves in the country that gave us birth against the opposition of the invaders. Thus our position is most extraordinary and complicated. But there is more. As our role has always been strictly passive and political existence nil, we find that our quest for liberty is now even more difficult of accomplishment; for we, having been placed in a state lower than slavery, had been robbed not only of our freedom but also of the right to exercise an active domestic tyrannyâ€¦We have been ruled more by deceit than by force, and we have been degraded more by vice than by superstition. Slavery is the daughter of darkness: an ignorant people is a blind instrument of its own destruction. Ambition and intrigue abuses the credulity and experience of men lacking all political, economic, and civic knowledge; they adopt pure illusion as reality; they take license for liberty, treachery for patriotism, and vengeance for justice. If a people, perverted by their training, succeed in achieving their liberty, they will soon lose it, for it would be of no avail to endeavor to explain to them that happiness consists in the practice of virtue; that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of tyrants, because, as the laws are more inflexible, every one should submit to their beneficent austerity; that proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law; and that to practice justice is to practice liberty.""

The author of this text expresses a belief in which of the following as requirements for a properly functioning legal system? Choices: a) Truth and religion b) Freedom and democracy c) Intelligence and order d) Morality and justice 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key concepts expressed in the text. The author mentions that a people must be ""ignorant"" in order to be ""blind instruments of their own destruction."" This suggests that the author believes that a lack of knowledge or intelligence is a problem.
Next, I need to consider the author's views on the relationship between knowledge and the functioning of a legal system. The author states that ""ambition and intrigue abuses the credulity and experience of men lacking all political, economic, and civic knowledge."" This suggests that the author believes that a lack of knowledge or intelligence can lead to the abuse of power and the undermining of a legal system.
Now, I need to consider the author's views on the requirements for a properly functioning legal system. The author states that ""happiness consists in the practice of virtue; that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of tyrants, because, as the laws are more inflexible, every one should submit to their beneficent austerity; that proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law; and that to practice justice is to practice liberty.""

""Purusa-Sukta""
Purusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.
It was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.
When they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.

Which of the following would best contradict the argument that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles on Indian society in the period 600 BCE to 600 CE? Choices: a) For there is nothing better for a Kshatriya than a righteous battle. b) The four divisions of human society are created by me Krishna. c) The person traditionally credited with composing the Mahabarata was born to a fisherwoman. d) The Hindu God Shiva is considered to be simultaneously the creator, the preserver, and the destroyer. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the argument that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles on Indian society in the period 600 BCE to 600 CE. This argument suggests that the caste system was a rigid and unchanging social hierarchy that determined an individual's economic and social status.
Next, I need to analyze the options to see which one would best contradict this argument. Option a) states that there is nothing better for a Kshatriya than a righteous battle, which implies that the Kshatriya caste had a specific role or duty, but it does not contradict the argument that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles.
Option b) states that the four divisions of human society are created by me Krishna, which implies that the caste system was created by a divine being and is therefore not subject to change, which would contradict the argument that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles.
Option c) states that the person traditionally credited with composing the Mahabarata was born to a fisherwoman, which implies that social mobility was possible, but it does not directly contradict the argument that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles.
Option d) states that the Hindu God Shiva is considered to be simultaneously the creator, the preserver, and the destroyer, which is a statement about the nature of the Hindu God Shiva and does not directly relate to the caste system.

""The question as to who, and what, is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels. Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.""
Walter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974
Rodney's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.? Choices: a) The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers b) The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World c) The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa d) The importation of New World products into Africa 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main argument of Walter Rodney's passage. Rodney argues that the imperialist system is responsible for African underdevelopment, and that European capitalists were the ones who actively extended their exploitation to cover the whole of Africa.
Next, I need to consider the developments of the period 1450 to 1750 C.E. that could be related to Rodney's argument. The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers is not a major development of this period, as European powers did not begin to colonize the interior of Africa until the 19th century.
The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World is also not directly related to Rodney's argument, as the passage does not mention the transatlantic slave trade or the forced migration of Africans to the Americas.
The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa is a development of this period, but it is not the most likely response to Rodney's argument. While the spread of Christianity may have been facilitated by European colonization, it is not the primary factor that Rodney identifies as responsible for African underdevelopment.
The importation of New World products into Africa is a development of this period, and it is the most likely response to Rodney's argument. Rodney argues that European capitalists extended their exploitation to cover the whole of Africa, and the importation of New World products into Africa would have been a way for European capitalists to extract wealth from Africa and to impose their economic dominance over the continent.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

The following poem refers to an incident in Sharpeville, South Africa, in 1960. To protest the requirement that they carry papers documenting their identity and residence, black South Africans gathered in front of police stations without their papers. Though other protests ended peacefully, in Sharpeville, police fired into the crowd.
What is important
about Sharpeville
is not that seventy died:
nor even that they were shot in the back
retreating, unarmed, defenceless
and certainty not
the heavy caliber slug
that tore through a mother's back
and ripped through the child in her arms
killing it
Remember Sharpeville
bullet-in-the-back day
Because it epitomized oppression
and the nature of society
More clearly than anything else;
it was the classic event
Nowhere is racial dominance
more clearly defined
nowhere the will to oppress
more clearly demonstrated
What the world whispers
apartheid declares with snarling guns
the blood the rich lust after
South Africa spills dust
Remember Sharpeville
Remember bullet-in-the-back day
And remember the unquenchable will for freedom
Remember the dead
and be glad
â€”Dennis Brutus, 1973
What does the poet mean by ""what the world whispers""? Choices: a) The world is too afraid of South Africa to oppose apartheid. b) The world engages in subtler forms of discrimination. c) The world condemns South Africaâ€™s discrimination. d) The world economy promotes South Africaâ€™s discrimination. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the poem. The poem refers to the Sharpeville incident in 1960, where police fired into a crowd of black South Africans, killing 70 people. The poem is a reflection on the incident and its significance.
Next, I need to analyze the line ""What the world whispers"". The phrase ""what the world whispers"" suggests a subtle or quiet expression of something. In this context, the poet is likely referring to the way the world expresses its disapproval or criticism of South Africa's apartheid regime.
Now, I need to consider the possible meanings of the phrase. Option a) suggests that the world is too afraid to oppose apartheid, which is not the tone of the poem. Option c) suggests that the world condemns apartheid, which is not the tone of the phrase. Option d) suggests that the world economy promotes apartheid, which is not the tone of the poem. Option b) suggests that the world engages in subtler forms of discrimination, which aligns with the tone of the poem. The poem highlights the ways in which apartheid is not just a South African issue, but a global problem that is perpetuated through subtle forms of discrimination.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them.... He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.

What was the world history event occurring in the stated time frame that caused the Soviet Union to enter Korea? Choices: a) The Crimean War b) World War I c) World War II d) The Seven Yearsâ€™ War 
Output:
First, I need to identify the time frame in which the event occurred. The text mentions that the event occurred in the 1940s.
Next, I need to consider the major world history events that occurred in the 1940s. The Crimean War occurred in the 1850s, World War I occurred in the 1910s, and the Seven Years' War occurred in the 1750s and 1760s.
Now, I need to consider the event that caused the Soviet Union to enter Korea in the 1940s. The text does not explicitly state the event, but it mentions that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea or were already there. This suggests that the event was a conflict or war that involved the Soviet Union and Korea.
Considering the major world history events of the 1940s, I can conclude that the event that caused the Soviet Union to enter Korea was World War II. World War II was a global conflict that involved many countries, including the Soviet Union and Korea. The Soviet Union entered the war in 1941 and played a significant role in the defeat of Nazi Germany. The war also led to the division of Korea into North and South Korea, with the Soviet Union controlling the north and the United States controlling the south.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

First, I need to identify the key elements of the speaker's religion. The speaker mentions the Spirit that is in their heart and Brahman, which suggests a belief in a single, all-encompassing deity.
Next, I need to analyze the speaker's views on the afterlife. The speaker states that they will come to the Spirit when they go beyond this life, which implies a belief in an afterlife.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) is incorrect because the speaker does not mention rituals. Option c) is incorrect because the speaker does not mention the gods. Option d) is incorrect because the speaker mentions a single deity, Brahman.

First, I need to understand the context of the passage. Peter the Great ruled Russia and was determined to change his country.
Next, I need to identify the practice that Peter the Great continued. The passage states that Peter the Great was convinced that he must provide both the direction and the motive force to transform Russia, and that he would try to lead but could driveâ€”and if necessary flogâ€”the backward nation forward.
Now, I need to analyze the options. Decentralization of power (a) is the opposite of what Peter the Great did, as he wanted to lead and provide direction. Isolationism (b) is not mentioned in the passage. Reform (d) is also not mentioned in the passage.

""Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighboring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations does not make us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our chief safeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws, particularly such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they are actually on the statute book, or belong to that code which, although unwritten, yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace.""

During the time period in which this text was written, who was allowed to participate in the Greek democratic process? Choices: a) All adult men born within the geographic boundaries of the state b) All adult men and women born within the geographic boundaries of the state c) All adult men who were citizens of the state by birth d) All adult men and women who were citizens of the state by birth 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key phrases in the text that indicate who is allowed to participate in the democratic process. The text states that ""advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit"" and that ""poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition.""
Next, I need to analyze the meaning of these phrases. The phrases suggest that the democratic process is open to all adult men who are able to serve the state, regardless of their social class or economic status.
Finally, I need to consider the historical context in which the text was written. The text was written in ancient Greece, where women and slaves were not considered citizens and therefore were not allowed to participate in the democratic process.

First, I need to identify the context of the passage. The passage is a keynote address to the Bandung Conference, 1955, which was a conference of non-aligned nations in Asia and Africa.
Next, I need to understand the language used by Sukarno. Sukarno mentions ""revolutions"" and ""our countries,"" which suggests that he is referring to political movements or changes in the region.
Now, I need to consider the historical context. The Bandung Conference was held in 1955, a time when many countries in Asia and Africa were gaining independence from colonial rule. This suggests that the ""revolutions"" Sukarno is referring to are likely related to the process of decolonization.

Whereas he who transgresses its ordinances is punished.
It lies as a path in front of even him who knows nothing.
Wrongdoing has never yet brought its venture to portâ€¦
Those whom the gods guide cannot lose themselves.
Those to whom they forbid passage will not be able to cross the river of life.
from The Maxims of Ptahhotep, Egypt, ca. 2400 B.C.E.
The tone of the second text best reflects which of the following hypotheses about the influence of religious beliefs on ancient societies? Choices: a) Ancient Egyptian society held compassion up as the highest virtue. b) Ancient Egyptians believed that moral behavior affected one's fate after death. c) Ancient Egyptian clergy promoted a strict ""eye for an eye"" code of ethics. d) Ancient Egyptian worshippers committed to an elaborate set of rituals and offerings. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the tone of the second text. The text emphasizes the importance of truth and moral behavior, stating that wrongdoing has never brought its venture to port and that those whom the gods guide cannot lose themselves.
Next, I need to consider the implications of the tone. The text suggests that moral behavior has consequences, and that those who follow the path of truth will be guided by the gods.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) is not supported by the text, as there is no mention of compassion as the highest virtue. Option c) is also not supported, as the text promotes a more nuanced view of morality. Option d) is not relevant to the tone of the text, which focuses on moral behavior rather than rituals and offerings.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

""I travelled thence to 'Aden, the port of Yemen, on the coast of the ocean. It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only; it has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God.""
Ibn Battuta, ca. 1325â€“1354 C.E.
The tone of the journal best reflects which of the following developments in the Indian Ocean trade network? Choices: a) The ability of commerce to foster cultural diffusion b) The superiority of Arabian port cities c) The increasing difficulty caused by language barriers d) The overproduction of cash crops 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements of the journal that suggest the tone reflects a specific development in the Indian Ocean trade network. The journal describes Aden as a bustling port city with merchants from various regions, including India and Egypt. It highlights the wealth and generosity of the merchants, as well as their piety and humility.
Next, I need to consider the options and determine which one is most closely aligned with the tone of the journal. The journal does not suggest that Arabian port cities are superior to others, so option b is unlikely. The journal also does not mention language barriers as a challenge, so option c is also unlikely. The journal does not discuss cash crops, so option d is also unlikely.
The journal does suggest that the merchants in Aden are wealthy and generous, and that they treat strangers well. This suggests that commerce is fostering cultural diffusion, as people from different regions are interacting and exchanging goods and ideas. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

""After the Tencteri came, in former days, the Bructeri; but the general account now is, that the Chamavi and Angrivarii entered their settlements, drove them out and utterly exterminated them with the common help of the [neighboring] tribes, either from hatred of their tyranny, or from the attractions of plunder, or from heaven's [favorable] regard for us. It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.""

Which of the following contributed LEAST to the decline of the Roman Empire? Choices: a) Civil wars between rivals for the throne b) Incursions of barbarian peoples into the empire c) The persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire d) Demographic weakness on account of diseases and epidemics 
Output:
First, I need to identify the factors that contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire. The passage mentions the extermination of the Bructeri by the Chamavi and Angrivarii, which suggests that the incursions of barbarian peoples into the empire contributed to the decline.
Next, I need to consider the other options. Civil wars between rivals for the throne (option a) and demographic weakness on account of diseases and epidemics (option d) are well-known factors that contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire.
Now, I need to evaluate option c, the persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire. The passage does not mention the senate at all, but it does mention the Roman arms and weapons, which suggests that the Roman Empire was still a powerful force. The persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire would likely have contributed to the stability and continuity of the empire, rather than its decline.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

""Poor Winter King,"" seventeenth-century song
The narrator of the song would most likely identify as which of the following? Choices: a) Roman Catholic b) Eastern Orthodox c) Protestant d) Muslim 
Output:
First, the narrator of the song is referring to the Winter King, which is a nickname for Frederick V, the Elector Palatine. He was a Protestant and the leader of the Protestant Union in the Holy Roman Empire.
Next, the song is written in a style that is typical of the Protestant Reformation, with a focus on individual conscience and moral accountability.
Finally, the song is critical of Frederick V for his actions, which suggests that the narrator is a member of a different religious group. Given the historical context, it is likely that the narrator is a Roman Catholic, who would have seen Frederick V's actions as a challenge to the authority of the Catholic Church.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
""The quicksilver mines of Huancavelica are where the poor Indians are so harshly punished, where they are tortured and so many Indians die; it is there that the noble caciques [headmen] of this kingdom are finished off and tortured. The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]â€¦.The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a yearâ€¦.
And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.
And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubinesâ€¦.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]â€¦at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.

Compared to the practices in the excerpt, English treatment of the natives in the New World differed in that they Choices: a) viewed the natives as true equals as they settled the Americas b) were confused by the natives' lack of a notion of land ownership c) widely did not condone intermingling with the natives d) used the natives exclusively for harvesting cash crops, like tobacco and cotton 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the excerpt. The excerpt describes the harsh treatment of the indigenous people in the New World, specifically in the mines of South America, by the Spanish colonizers. The treatment includes physical punishment, torture, and exploitation for labor.
Next, I need to compare the practices described in the excerpt to the English treatment of the natives in the New World. The excerpt highlights the brutal and oppressive nature of the Spanish treatment, including the use of torture, exploitation, and forced labor.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) suggests that the English viewed the natives as true equals, which is not supported by historical evidence. Option b) mentions the English being confused by the natives' lack of a notion of land ownership, which is not directly related to the treatment of the natives. Option c) suggests that the English widely did not condone intermingling with the natives, which is not accurate. Option d) states that the English used the natives exclusively for harvesting cash crops, like tobacco and cotton, which is partially true but does not capture the full extent of the exploitation.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

""To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat herâ€“â€“because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploitersâ€“â€“to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weakâ€“â€“therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mightyâ€“â€“therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.

The reference to the ""continual beatings"" most directly supports which of the following decisions in later Soviet foreign policy? Choices: a) The invasion of Afghanistan b) The creation of the Warsaw Pact c) The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe d) The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of the passage. The passage is about the history of Russia and how it was beaten by other countries because of its backwardness. It emphasizes the importance of not being backward and weak.
Next, I need to analyze the options and see which one is most closely related to the idea of not being backward and weak. The passage does not specifically mention any of the options, but it does mention the importance of being strong and not being beaten.
The invasion of Afghanistan (option a) is not directly related to the idea of not being backward and weak. The creation of the Warsaw Pact (option b) is also not directly related, as it was a response to the formation of NATO, not a response to backwardness. The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine (option c) is more closely related, as it was a response to the threat of Western influence and the need to maintain Soviet dominance in Eastern Europe. The declaration of war against Japan (option d) is not directly related, as it was a response to Japan's aggression, not a response to backwardness.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

O ye who believe! Strong drink and games of chance and idolsâ€¦ are only an infamy of Satan's handiwork. Leave it aside in order that ye may succeed.
the Qur'an, Sura 5: 89
When once you hear the roses are in bloom,
Then is the time, my love, to pour the wine.
the RubÃ¡iyÃ¡t of Omar KhayyÃ¡m
Both verses relate most closely to Choices: a) key economic processes within Islamic society. b) production of food and drink in Islamic society. c) religious regulation of personal behavior in Islamic society. d) changing gender relations in Islamic society. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main theme of the two verses. The first verse from the Qur'an talks about the prohibition of strong drink and games of chance, which are considered an infamy of Satan's handiwork. The second verse from the RubÃ¡iyÃ¡t of Omar KhayyÃ¡m talks about pouring wine when the roses are in bloom.
Next, I need to analyze the context of the verses. The first verse is from the Qur'an, which is a holy book of Islam, and it emphasizes the importance of leaving aside vices such as strong drink and games of chance. The second verse is from a Persian poem, and it has a more poetic and sensual tone, but it also mentions wine.
Now, I need to consider the options. Option a) key economic processes within Islamic society is not directly related to the verses, as they do not mention economic activities. Option b) production of food and drink in Islamic society is also not directly related, as the verses are more focused on the consumption of strong drink rather than its production. Option c) religious regulation of personal behavior in Islamic society is the most relevant option, as the verses both relate to the regulation of personal behavior, specifically the prohibition of strong drink and the enjoyment of wine in a poetic context. Option d) changing gender relations in Islamic society is not relevant, as the verses do not mention gender relations.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

Letter from a Jewish trader in India to his wife in Cairo, ca. 1200
Which of the following is the most probable cause of the marital strain evident in the passage above? Choices: a) The strain placed on merchant families by long periods of separation b) Religious disagreements arising from the merchant's exposure to Hinduism c) A decision on the part of the merchant to remain permanently in India d) Bankruptcy stranding the merchant far from home 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context of the letter. The letter is from a Jewish trader in India to his wife in Cairo, which suggests that the couple is separated by a significant distance.
Next, I need to consider the content of the letter. The letter mentions that the waiting has been long and that the merchant cannot come home with nothing, which suggests that the merchant has been away for a long time and is struggling financially.
Now, I need to consider the options. Option a) The strain placed on merchant families by long periods of separation is a plausible explanation for the marital strain, as the couple has been separated for a long time. Option b) Religious disagreements arising from the merchant's exposure to Hinduism is unlikely, as there is no mention of Hinduism in the letter. Option c) A decision on the part of the merchant to remain permanently in India is also unlikely, as the merchant is asking his wife to accept a bill of repudiation, which suggests that he wants to end the marriage. Option d) Bankruptcy stranding the merchant far from home is possible, but it is not the most probable cause of the marital strain, as the letter mentions that the merchant cannot come home with nothing, which suggests that he has some financial resources.
Therefore, the most probable cause of the marital strain is {'sol': 'a'}"

You are the United States,
you are the future invader
of the native America that has Indian blood,
that still prays to Jesus Christ and still speaks Spanish.
...
you are Alexander-Nebuchadnezzar.
You think that life is fire,
that progress is eruption,

What events might have prompted the poet to compose this piece? Choices: a) The discovery of the Zimmerman Telegram b) The embargo of Cuba after Castroâ€™s revolution c) U.S. involvement in Panamaâ€™s independence d) U.S. involvement in the Haitian Revolution 
Output:
First, I need to consider the historical context in which the poem was written. The poem was written in 1904 by Ruben Dario, a Nicaraguan poet.
Next, I need to examine the language and tone of the poem. The poem is written in a passionate and defensive tone, with the poet addressing the United States directly and accusing it of being a future invader of the native America.
Now, I need to consider the events that might have prompted the poet to write such a piece. The poem was written during a time of growing U.S. influence in the region, particularly in the Caribbean and Central America.
The U.S. had recently intervened in the Dominican Republic in 1903, and there were concerns about U.S. expansionism in the region. The poem's reference to the ""Saxon eyes and barbarous soul"" of the U.S. suggests that the poet was responding to these concerns.
The U.S. had also been involved in the construction of the Panama Canal, which was completed in 1914, but the poet's reference to the ""iron claws"" of the U.S. suggests that the poem was written before this event.
The U.S. had not been involved in the Haitian Revolution, which took place in the late 18th century.
The U.S. had not embargoed Cuba after Castro's revolution, as Castro did not come to power until 1959.
The U.S. had discovered the Zimmerman Telegram in 1917, during World War I.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of the passage. The passage describes the conflict between the Bructeri and the Chamavi and Angrivarii, and how the Roman Empire benefited from the conflict.
Next, I need to analyze the motivations behind the Roman Empire's actions. The passage states that the Roman Empire helped the Chamavi and Angrivarii drive out the Bructeri, and that the Roman Empire benefited from the conflict. The passage also states that the Roman Empire encouraged the conflict between the tribes, and that the Roman Empire was pleased to see the Bructeri defeated.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices. Choice a) Empires encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another to reduce threats to the state, is the most directly supported by the passage. The passage states that the Roman Empire helped the Chamavi and Angrivarii drive out the Bructeri, and that the Roman Empire encouraged the conflict between the tribes. This suggests that the Roman Empire encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another in order to reduce threats to the state.

But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight.... The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military... was relaxed... ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.

The decline of the Roman Empire and that of its Chinese counterpart resulted in which of the following? Choices: a) A decline in the appeal of religions of salvation b) A shift from trade along the Silk Roads to sea routes in the Indian Ocean c) An increased importance of the role of the father as the head of the household d) A decline in the rights of women 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context of the decline of the Roman Empire and its Chinese counterpart. The decline of these empires was a result of internal decay and external pressures, such as barbarian invasions.
Next, I need to analyze the potential consequences of such a decline. A decline in the appeal of religions of salvation (a) might be a possible consequence, as the decline of empires can lead to a loss of faith in established institutions.
However, a shift from trade along the Silk Roads to sea routes in the Indian Ocean (b) is not directly related to the decline of empires, as trade routes can be affected by various factors, including technological advancements and economic changes.
An increased importance of the role of the father as the head of the household (c) is unlikely, as the decline of empires often leads to social and cultural upheaval, which can result in changes to traditional social structures.
A decline in the rights of women (d) is also unlikely, as the decline of empires often leads to a breakdown of traditional social norms and institutions, which can result in changes to the status of women.
Therefore, the most plausible consequence of the decline of the Roman Empire and its Chinese counterpart is a decline in the appeal of religions of salvation.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,

The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani.

What is the most likely explanation for a Muslim being in charge of the Ghanian treasury? Choices: a) To facilitate trade with the predominantly Muslim merchants during this era. b) The king of Ghana had recently become a Muslim. c) Merchants and trade were considered taboo in the traditional pagan religion. d) African kings were merely vassals of the Muslim caliphs. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the historical context of the passage. The passage describes the city of Ghana as having a predominantly Muslim population, with many Muslims holding positions of power, including the king's interpreters and ministers.
Next, I need to analyze the specific information provided about the Muslim in charge of the treasury. The passage states that the king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury, and the majority of his ministers are Muslims.
Now, I need to consider the possible explanations for a Muslim being in charge of the treasury. Option a) is plausible, as trade with Muslim merchants would have been an important aspect of Ghana's economy. Option b) is also possible, as the king of Ghana may have recently converted to Islam. Option c) is unlikely, as there is no indication that trade was considered taboo in the traditional pagan religion. Option d) is also unlikely, as there is no evidence to suggest that African kings were vassals of the Muslim caliphs.
Therefore, the most likely explanation is that the king of Ghana had recently become a Muslim, {'sol': 'b'}."

""From the confines of Jerusalem and the city of Constantinople a horrible tale has gone forth and very frequently has been brought to our ears, namely, that a race from the kingdom of the Persians, an accursed race, a race utterly alienated from God, a generation forsooth which has not directed its heart and has not entrusted its spirit to God, has invaded the lands of those Christians and has depopulated them by the sword, pillage and fire; it has led away a part of the captives into its own country, and a part it has destroyed by cruel tortures; it has either entirely destroyed the churches of God or appropriated them for the rites of its own religionâ€¦.The kingdom of the Greeks is now dismembered by them and deprived of territory so vast in extent that it cannot be traversed in a march of two months. On whom therefore is the labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering this territory incumbent, if not upon you?

Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the speech. The speech is given by Pope Urban II at the Council of Clermont in 1095 C.E. and is an appeal to the nobles and knights to go on a military campaign to the Holy Land.
Next, I need to identify the key elements of the speech. The speech emphasizes the importance of Jerusalem, describing it as the ""navel of the world"" and the ""royal city"" that is now held captive by its enemies.
Now, I need to consider the options in the context of the speech. Option a) Pilgrimages to centers of religious significance is the most relevant, as the speech is an appeal to go on a military campaign to the Holy Land, which is a center of religious significance for Christians.
Option b) Eradication of heresies is not relevant, as the speech does not mention heresies.
Option c) The reconstruction of trade routes is not relevant, as the speech does not mention trade routes.
Option d) Developments in religious art is not relevant, as the speech does not mention art.

Woman, wake up; the bell of reason is being heard throughout the whole universe; discover your rights. Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind?

The independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fearâ€”but apart from that, nothing has changed.
Halima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence
Publication of the first passage was followed by which of the political outcomes described below? Choices: a) French women, like Jews, Protestants, and freed blacks, attained political equality after only a short delay. b) French women quickly gained the right to vote, but not to hold political office. c) French women found their status even lower than it had been before the French Revolution. d) French women remained without full political rights until well into the following century. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context of the two passages. The first passage is from Olympe de Gouges, a French woman who wrote the ""Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen"" in 1791. This suggests that the passage is from the late 18th century, during the French Revolution.
Next, I need to consider the content of the passage. Olympe de Gouges is calling for women's rights and equality, and she is criticizing the leaders of the Revolution for not granting women the same rights as men. This suggests that women's rights were not yet fully recognized during the Revolution.
Now, I need to consider the second passage, which is from Halima Ghomri, an Algerian woman who was interviewed in the 1970s. This passage suggests that women's rights were not yet fully recognized in Algeria, even after the country gained independence from France.
Based on these considerations, I can conclude that the publication of the first passage was not followed by the political outcomes described in choices a) or b). The first passage was written during the French Revolution, but women's rights were not yet fully recognized at that time. The second passage suggests that women's rights were still not fully recognized in Algeria in the 1970s, even after the country gained independence.

In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race â€” by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.
British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860
Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.
Rudrangshu Mukherjee, ""The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,"" 1990
From the perspective of the first passage, the death of British citizens at Cawnpore Choices: a) seems to mark a betrayal of a ""higher"" race by a ""lesser"" race. b) should be seen as a regrettable but avoidable mistake. c) can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves. d) was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the context of the Cawnpore massacres. The passage describes the event as a ""servile war, a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge"" between the British and the Indian rebels.
Next, I need to consider the perspective of the British journalist William Howard Russell, who views the massacres as a betrayal by a ""subject race"" against their masters.
Now, I need to evaluate the options based on the context and perspective. Option a) seems to align with Russell's perspective, as it implies a betrayal by a ""lesser"" race against a ""higher"" race. Option b) does not fit with the context, as the massacres were not seen as a regrettable mistake, but rather as a deliberate act of violence. Option c) is also not supported by the context, as the British were not seen as responsible for the massacres. Option d) is not mentioned in the passage, and the perspective of the Indian rebels is not provided.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

Questions to the passage below, an account given to a French officer in Algeria in the 1830s by a member of an Arab slave trade caravan.
The Slave Trade
All of you [soldiers], are summoned... to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""].... The soldiery divided themselves into two companies... with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields.... Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beardâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negressâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negroâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.30,000 cowries
A young Negress â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦50â€“60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro childâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.35â€“40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women.... It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own.... Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk.... They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.
How was the Arab trade in Africans different from the Atlantic slave trade? Choices: a) Unlike Arab slave merchants, those involved in the Atlantic slave trade were motivated by religion. b) Slaves taken for the Atlantic slave trade had no prospect of eventual liberty, but slaves taken by Arab merchants did. c) Slaves taken for the Atlantic trade were predominantly female; slaves taken by Arab merchants were mostly male. d) Slaves taken by Arab merchants were likely to have a shorter life span than those taken for the Atlantic trade. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the motivations behind the two slave trades. The Atlantic slave trade was primarily motivated by economic factors, with European colonizers seeking to exploit the labor of enslaved Africans to fuel their own economic growth. In contrast, the Arab slave trade was also motivated by economic factors, but it was also influenced by social and cultural factors, such as the desire for concubines and the need for labor in the Arab world.
Next, I need to examine the demographics of the slaves taken by each trade. The Atlantic slave trade predominantly involved the forced migration of enslaved Africans to the Americas, with a significant proportion of slaves being female. In contrast, the Arab slave trade involved the forced migration of enslaved Africans to the Arab world, with a significant proportion of slaves being male.
Finally, I need to consider the treatment and living conditions of slaves in each trade. The Atlantic slave trade was notorious for its brutal treatment of enslaved Africans, with many slaves being subjected to harsh conditions, including forced labor, physical punishment, and separation from their families. In contrast, the Arab slave trade was also marked by brutal treatment, but it was also characterized by a higher proportion of slaves being used for domestic and concubine purposes, which may have led to better living conditions for some slaves.

Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at PotosÃ­ have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.

The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.
Heinrich von FÃ¼ch, ""On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,"" 1744
Which of the following factors, not mentioned in the second passage, would have been most likely to create added difficulties for native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations? Choices: a) The arrival of rival hunters from China and Japan b) The impact of epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers c) The general warming of the climate during this time period d) The reduced demand for furs among European and Asian elites 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context of the passage, which describes the difficulties faced by native Siberians in fulfilling their tribute obligations due to the lack of furbearing animals and the loss of horses.
Next, I need to evaluate the options and determine which one would have created added difficulties for native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations.
The arrival of rival hunters from China and Japan (option a) might have competed with native Siberians for furbearing animals, but it would not have directly affected their ability to fulfill their tribute obligations.
The impact of epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers (option b) would have weakened the native population, making it even more difficult for them to fulfill their tribute obligations.
The general warming of the climate during this time period (option c) is not mentioned in the passage, and it is unlikely to have had a significant impact on the availability of furbearing animals or the native population's ability to fulfill their tribute obligations.
The reduced demand for furs among European and Asian elites (option d) would have reduced the incentive for native Siberians to hunt and fulfill their tribute obligations, but it would not have created added difficulties for them.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

""In the days of a great struggle against a foreign enemy who has been endeavoring for three years to enslave our country, it pleased God to send Russia a further painful trial. Internal troubles threatened to have a fatal effect on the further progress of this obstinate war. The destinies of Russia, the honor of her heroic Army, the happiness of the people, and the whole future of our beloved country demand that the war should be conducted at all costs to a victorious end.
The cruel enemy is making his last efforts and the moment is near when our valiant Army, in concert with our glorious Allies, will finally overthrow the enemy. In these decisive days in the life of Russia we have thought that we owed to our people the close union and organization of all its forces for the realization of a rapid victory; for which reason, in agreement with the Imperial Duma, we have recognized that it is for the good of the country that we should abdicate the Crown of the Russian State and lay down the Supreme Power.""

Czar Nicholas II's declaration of abdication in Source 1 is best understood in light of which of the following? Choices: a) Economic prosperity that fostered dislike of the aristocracy b) Widespread dislike of Nicholas' tolerance of political dissidents c) Large-scale military losses and resentment of the working classes d) Persecution of religious minorities 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context of the declaration of abdication. The declaration is made during a time of war and internal troubles, and the Tsar mentions the need for a ""victorious end"" to the war and the importance of the ""close union and organization of all its forces.""
Next, I need to consider the language and tone of the declaration. The Tsar expresses a sense of duty and responsibility to the country and the people, and he mentions the need to ""lay down the Supreme Power"" in order to achieve a ""rapid victory.""
Now, I need to consider the historical context of the Russian Revolution. The revolution was a complex and multifaceted event, but it was ultimately driven by a desire for change and a rejection of the old order. The Tsar's declaration of abdication was a key moment in this process, and it marked the beginning of the end of the Romanov dynasty.
Based on this analysis, I would conclude that the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

The system of labor described in the first passage came into being in which of the following ways? Choices: a) Spanish colonists enslaved native American populations outright. b) Spain refused to purchase slaves from Africa, relying instead on native American labor. c) Spanish authorities adapted local forms of labor mobilization for their own purposes. d) Spanish landowners came to depend heavily on plantation monoculture. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the system of labor described in the passage. The passage mentions the mita, which is a system of forced labor, and the Indians working in the mercury mine in the Huanacavelica range.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the Spanish colonization of the Americas. The Spanish colonizers did not bring African slaves to the Americas, but instead relied on the native population for labor.
Now, I need to analyze the options provided. Option a) is incorrect because the passage does not mention enslavement, but rather a system of forced labor. Option b) is also incorrect because the passage does not mention the Spanish refusing to purchase slaves from Africa. Option d) is incorrect because the passage does not mention plantation monoculture.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

At the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated.... The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions... a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.

First, I need to understand the context of the treaty. The treaty is about dividing the lands discovered in the ocean sea between the King of Portugal and the King of Castile, Aragon, etc.
Next, I need to consider the historical developments that could have led to such a treaty. European maritime exploration is a key development that could have led to the treaty, as it would have led to the discovery of new lands and the need to divide them.
Now, I need to evaluate the other options. The African slave trade is not directly related to the treaty, as it is not mentioned in the text. The Scientific Revolution and the Protestant Reformation are also not directly related to the treaty, as they are more focused on intellectual and religious developments rather than geographical exploration.

While some theorists in the Middle Ages argued that the jihad was a defensive warâ€¦ most authorities held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam. The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or ""Sea of Precious Virtues,"" written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.

It is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them. Likewise, not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories.

""In Northern India the existence of separate States at this period is usually little more than a question of words. A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.""

Moreland's description of revenue collection in the Mughal Empire is best seen as evidence for which of the following generalizations? Choices: a) Only people of certain religions were required to pay revenue to the empire. b) Geographical differences may have influenced which groups pay taxes. c) Revenue collection was the only source of funds by which the Mughal Empire operated. d) The case of Rajputana was a typical one in the Mughal Empire. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of the passage. The passage describes the revenue collection in the Mughal Empire, specifically in Northern India, and how it varied across different regions.
Next, I need to analyze the options and see which one aligns with the main idea of the passage. Option b) Geographical differences may have influenced which groups pay taxes, is the most relevant to the passage, as it mentions that in different regions, such as Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur, the chiefs and tribes occupied an anomalous position, sometimes paying revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence.
Option a) Only people of certain religions were required to pay revenue to the empire, is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention anything about religion.
Option c) Revenue collection was the only source of funds by which the Mughal Empire operated, is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention anything about the empire's sources of funds.

Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.
William Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, ""On the Suppression of Sati,"" 1829

Which of the following resources would the author of the second passage have been most likely interested in obtaining from local natives? Choices: a) Ivory b) Tobacco c) Silver d) Furs 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the context of the second passage. The author is discussing the nature and character of the Indians who trade with them and how they must be ruled with a rod of iron to bring them into a proper state of subordination.
Next, I need to identify the key phrase that indicates what the author is interested in obtaining from the local natives. The phrase ""the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them"" suggests that the author is interested in obtaining something of value in return for the goods they sell.
Now, I need to consider the options provided and determine which one would be most likely to be of value to the author. The options include ivory, tobacco, silver, and furs. Given the context of the passage, I would expect the author to be interested in obtaining something that is valuable and can be used to trade with the local natives.
Based on this analysis, I would conclude that the author would be most likely interested in obtaining furs, as they are a valuable commodity that can be used to trade with the local natives. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

Next, I need to identify the key phrases that reveal Lenin's philosophical underpinning. Lenin mentions the ""salvation of the revolution,"" ""the offer of peace,"" and ""the transfer of the land to the peasants,"" which suggests that he is advocating for a radical transformation of society.
Now, I need to consider the options. Capitalism and mercantilism are economic systems that prioritize private property and profit, which does not align with Lenin's call for radical transformation. Fascism is a political ideology that emphasizes authoritarianism and nationalism, which also does not fit with Lenin's emphasis on revolution and social change.

First, I need to identify the event that symbolized the end of South Africa's institutionalized discrimination. The poem mentions Sharpeville, which refers to an incident in 1960 where police fired into a crowd of black South Africans protesting the requirement to carry identity and residence papers.
Next, I need to consider the significance of the event. The poem states that Sharpeville ""epitomized oppression"" and ""the nature of society"" and that it ""more clearly than anything else"" demonstrated racial dominance and the will to oppress.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices. The election of F. W. de Klerk (a) and Nelson Mandela (b) were significant events in the transition to democracy in South Africa, but they did not symbolize the end of institutionalized discrimination. The bombing of Lesotho (c) is not related to the end of institutionalized discrimination in South Africa.

Which of the following inferences best explains the reason the King and Queen of Castile and Aragon insisted on Spanish control of territory west of the demarcation line? Choices: a) The Spanish desired to convert the Barbary states to Catholicism. b) The Spanish believed Portugal did not know about their discovery of the New World. c) The Spanish wanted to preserve the independence of Native states in the New World as a buffer against Portuguese expansion. d) The Spanish thought India would be harder to conquer than the New World. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the Treaty of Tordesillas. The treaty was signed in 1494 between Spain and Portugal to divide the New World between them. The line of demarcation was set at 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands.
Next, I need to analyze the motivations of the Spanish. The Spanish were interested in expanding their empire and gaining control of new territories. They had already discovered the New World and were eager to claim it as their own.
Now, I need to consider the options. Option a) is not relevant to the treaty, as the Barbary states were not involved in the negotiations. Option b) is not true, as the Portuguese were aware of the Spanish discovery of the New World. Option c) is not supported by historical evidence, as the Spanish did not prioritize preserving Native states as a buffer against Portuguese expansion.

When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols.... On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals.... The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value.

Choices: a) Imams and muezzins ensured that all Africans adhered to Islamic law. b) Some elites converted to Islam, but lower classes kept their traditional beliefs. c) Muslim merchants refused to do business with anyone who was not Muslim. d) African kings required Muslims to conform to pagan customs at court. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key information about Islam's influence in Africa during this time period. The excerpt mentions that the king of Malal was ""sincerely attached to Islam,"" which suggests that Islam had some influence in the region.
Next, I need to consider the social dynamics of the time period. The excerpt states that the common people of Malal remained polytheists, which suggests that Islam was not widely practiced among the general population.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices based on the information I have gathered. Choice a) is incorrect because the excerpt does not mention imams and muezzins enforcing Islamic law. Choice c) is also incorrect because the excerpt does not mention Muslim merchants refusing to do business with non-Muslims. Choice d) is incorrect because the excerpt does not mention African kings requiring Muslims to conform to pagan customs.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

""Upon their arrival they were honorably and graciously received by the grand Khan, in a full assembly of his principal officers. When they drew nigh to his person, they paid their respects by prostrating themselves on the floor. He immediately commanded them to rise, and to relate to him the circumstances of their travels, with all that had taken place in their negotiation with his holiness the pope. To their narrative, which they gave in the regular order of events, and delivered in perspicuous language, he listened with attentive silence. The letters and the presents from pope Gregory were then laid before him, and, upon hearing the former read, he bestowed much commendation on the fidelity, the zeal, and the diligence of his ambassadors; and receiving with due reverence the oil from the holy sepulchre, he gave directions that it should be preserved with religious care. Upon his observing Marco Polo, and inquiring who he was, Nicolo made answer, This is your servant, and my son; upon which the grand Khan replied, ""He is welcome, and it pleases me much,"" and he caused him to be enrolled amongst his attendants of honor. And on account of their return he made a great feast and rejoicing; and as long as the said brothers and Marco remained in the court of the grand Khan, they were honored even above his own courtiers. Marco was held in high estimation and respect by all belonging to the court. He learnt in a short time and adopted the manners of the Tartars, and acquired a proficiency in four different languages, which he became qualified to read and write.""
Marco Polo's Travels, ca. 1300 C.E.
Which of the following best characterizes one way in which the Mongol Empire was very different from the other major empires of the ancient and medieval worlds? Choices: a) The Mongols generally ignored or assimilated to the cultural identities of the people whom they conquered. b) The Mongols often took over territory without major destruction or bloodshed. c) The Mongols imposed their religious beliefs on the people whom they conquered. d) The Mongols had little interest in trading with their geographic neighbors. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the Mongol Empire's approach to cultural identity. The passage describes Marco Polo as adopting the manners of the Tartars and acquiring proficiency in four different languages, which suggests that the Mongols were open to cultural exchange and assimilation.
Next, I need to consider the Mongol Empire's approach to conquest. The passage describes the grand Khan's reception of the brothers and Marco Polo, and the fact that they were honored even above the courtiers, which suggests that the Mongols were able to integrate their subjects into their own culture.
Now, I need to consider the Mongol Empire's approach to religion. The passage does not mention the Mongols imposing their religious beliefs on the people they conquered, which suggests that the Mongols were tolerant of different religious beliefs.
Finally, I need to consider the Mongol Empire's approach to trade. The passage does not mention the Mongols having little interest in trading with their geographic neighbors, which suggests that the Mongols were interested in trade.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

""The real grievance of the worker is the insecurity of his existence; he is not sure that he will always have work, he is not sure that he will always be healthy, and he foresees that he will one day be old and unfit to work. If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently.

Next, I need to understand the context of the speech. The speech was given in 1884, and it was a time when workers were facing many challenges, including poverty and lack of social security.
Now, I need to analyze the options. Option a) Limited work hours in factories is not mentioned in the speech. Option c) Displaced citizens in the overpopulated city to the countryside is also not mentioned. Option d) Forced early retirement for aging workers is not mentioned either.
The correct answer is option b) Established public health care and pensions, which is mentioned in the speech as a solution to the insecurity of workers' existence.

The interactions described in the letters are best understood in the context of which of the following? Choices: a) Portuguese exploration of the coast of West Africa b) Catholic missionary efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa c) State formation in Sub-Saharan Africa d) Development of the slave trade in Sub-Saharan Africa 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the letters. The letters are written by King Afonso I of Kongo and King Manuel of Portugal, and they refer to interactions between the Kingdom of Kongo and Portugal.
Next, I need to identify the main issue being discussed in the letters. The letters mention the seizure of people from the Kingdom of Kongo and their sale to white men, which suggests that the issue is related to the slave trade.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) Portuguese exploration of the coast of West Africa is not directly related to the issue of people being seized and sold. Option b) Catholic missionary efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa may be related to the letters, but it is not the main issue being discussed. Option c) State formation in Sub-Saharan Africa is also not directly related to the issue.

Instructions from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo, 1512
The two letters best support which of the following conclusions? Choices: a) Diplomatic relations between Portugal and Kongo were often cordial. b) Kongolese noblemen were frequently taken as slaves by the Portuguese. c) Trade between Portugal and Kongo was highly regulated. d) Trade between Portugal and Kongo was brisk with both parties. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the content of the two letters. The first letter from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal expresses concern about the kidnapping of Kongolese people, including noblemen, by the Portuguese. This suggests that the relationship between the two kingdoms was not always cordial.
Next, I need to examine the second letter from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo, which instructs the envoy to negotiate with the Kongolese to fill the ships with slaves, copper, or ivory. This letter implies that trade between Portugal and Kongo was indeed regulated, as the Portuguese were seeking to extract specific goods from the Kongolese.
Now, I need to consider the overall tone and content of the two letters. While the first letter expresses concern and frustration, the second letter is more pragmatic and focused on trade. This suggests that the relationship between the two kingdoms was complex and multifaceted, and that trade was a significant aspect of their interactions.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!
What's this that you have done?
Is 't not a very naughty thing
To snatch the kaiser's crown?
Now you will have to stay away
Alike from Rhine and Prague,
And more than that-shame and dismay
Your days and nights will plague.
Right well you knew, and all the world,
Right well they know this thing,
That Ferdinand alone can be
Bohemia's lawful king.
So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go
To Ferdinand, your king,
And beg him graciously to show
Full pardon for your sin.
""Poor Winter King,"" seventeenth-century song
Based on the song, the Winter King did which of the following? Choices: a) Gave over his crown to King Ferdinand b) Successfully defended his land from the Holy Roman Empire c) Rebelled against King Ferdinand d) Claimed the lands of Bohemia for the Catholic Church 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main action of the song. The song is about the Winter King's actions and the consequences of those actions.
Next, I need to analyze the lyrics to determine what the Winter King did. The lyrics state that the Winter King ""snatched the kaiser's crown,"" which implies that he took something that didn't belong to him.
Now, I need to consider the context of the song. The song is set in the 17th century, and the lyrics mention the Holy Roman Empire and the king of Bohemia. This suggests that the Winter King was a ruler who was challenging the authority of the Holy Roman Empire.
Based on the lyrics and context, it appears that the Winter King rebelled against King Ferdinand, who was the rightful king of Bohemia. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes.

Choices: a) Barbarian peoples were converted to the religions of their host societies. b) Barbarian peoples were utilized as soldiers in their host societies. c) Barbarian peoples were uniformly relegated to a servile status through the laws of their host societies. d) Barbarian peoples were often invited by their host societies to rule instead of the societies' own ruling classes. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies in the period 600â€“1450 C.E. that is similar to the treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies between 600 B.C.E. and 600 C.E.
In the given text, it is mentioned that the Chamavi and Angrivarii tribes were driven out and exterminated by the neighboring tribes, and the Roman Empire was delighted by the spectacle of the conflict. This suggests that the barbarian peoples were used as a means to achieve the goals of the civilized societies, rather than being treated as equals or being relegated to a servile status.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) Barbarian peoples were converted to the religions of their host societies, is not similar to the treatment described in the text, as there is no mention of conversion. Option c) Barbarian peoples were uniformly relegated to a servile status through the laws of their host societies, is also not similar, as the text suggests that the barbarian peoples were used for the benefit of the civilized societies, rather than being treated as inferior. Option d) Barbarian peoples were often invited by their host societies to rule instead of the societies' own ruling classes, is not similar, as the text suggests that the barbarian peoples were driven out and exterminated, rather than being invited to rule.

""I travelled thence to 'Aden, the port of Yemen, on the coast of the ocean. It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only; it has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected.

The views expressed in this journal passage are best seen as evidence of which of the following concerning medieval Islamic societies? Choices: a) The absence of religious orthodoxy b) Hostility toward outsiders c) Limited economic opportunities d) The supremacy of piety 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the passage to understand the views expressed by Ibn Battuta. He describes Aden as a hot and dry place with no crops, trees, or water, but notes that the inhabitants are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character.
Next, I need to consider the economic opportunities in Aden. Ibn Battuta mentions that some merchants are immensely rich, owning large ships and their contents, and that there is a rivalry amongst them to show off their wealth.
Now, I need to evaluate the options in light of the passage. Option a) The absence of religious orthodoxy is not supported by the passage, as Ibn Battuta describes the inhabitants as pious and generous in character. Option b) Hostility toward outsiders is also not supported, as Ibn Battuta notes that the inhabitants treat strangers well. Option c) Limited economic opportunities is contradicted by the passage, which describes the wealth and prosperity of the merchants in Aden. Option d) The supremacy of piety is supported by the passage, which describes the inhabitants as pious, humble, upright, and generous in character.

""MAHATMA GANDHI'S MESSAGE.
REMAIN NON-VIOLENT
The following message was sent by Mahatma Gandhi from Waltair:â€”
Maulana Mohamed AH was arrested at Waltair under sections 107 and 108 to be called upon to give security, to be of good behaviour for one year. The place and date of trial is unknown.
The Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.
He and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.
I hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.
By striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.
Let us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal.""
Mohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921
Which of the following historical developments from the period 1450â€“1750 C.E. most inspired the instructions indicated in the fifth paragraph to boycott foreign cloth? Choices: a) The conquest of India by rival Muslim empires b) The development of joint-stock companies c) The importation of food crops from the New World d) The African slave trade 
Output:
First, I need to identify the historical development that inspired the instructions to boycott foreign cloth. The instructions were given by Mahatma Gandhi in 1921.
Next, I need to consider the historical developments that occurred between 1450 and 1750. The conquest of India by rival Muslim empires (a) occurred before 1450, so it is not relevant. The development of joint-stock companies (b) is also not relevant, as it refers to European trade companies that emerged in the 16th century. The importation of food crops from the New World (c) is also not relevant, as it refers to the Columbian Exchange, which occurred in the 16th century. The African slave trade (d) is also not relevant, as it refers to the transatlantic slave trade, which emerged in the 16th century.
Now, I need to consider the historical developments that occurred between 1750 and 1921. The Indian Rebellion of 1857, also known as the Sepoy Mutiny, was a major uprising against British rule in India. The rebellion was sparked by the introduction of the Enfield rifle, which used greased cartridges that had to be bitten open before loading. The grease used was pig fat and beef tallow, which offended both Hindus and Muslims. The rebellion was eventually put down, but it led to significant changes in British policy towards India, including the introduction of the Indian Councils Act of 1861, which established a legislative council in India.
The instructions to boycott foreign cloth were likely inspired by the Indian Rebellion of 1857, which was a major catalyst for the Indian independence movement. The boycott of foreign cloth was a key aspect of the Swadeshi movement, which emerged in the early 20th century as a response to British colonial rule. The Swadeshi movement emphasized the importance of self-sufficiency and the use of Indian-made goods, including cloth.

Most revolutions produce a strong leading figure; the French Revolution allowed which of the following to assume great power? Choices: a) King Louis XVI b) Robespierre c) Jean Lafitte d) Lafayette 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key figures mentioned in the passage. The passage mentions Charles Dickens and William Wordsworth, but they are not the key figures of the French Revolution. The passage also mentions King Louis XVI, Robespierre, Jean Lafitte, and Lafayette, but only one of them is the correct answer.
Next, I need to analyze the context of the passage. The passage is a quote from Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities, which is a historical novel about the French Revolution. The passage describes the tumultuous and chaotic nature of the time period, but it does not mention King Louis XVI as a strong leading figure.
Now, I need to consider the other options. Robespierre was a key figure in the French Revolution, known for his radical views and his role as the leader of the Committee of Public Safety. Jean Lafitte was a pirate who lived during the same time period, but he was not a key figure in the French Revolution. Lafayette was a French aristocrat who played a role in the early stages of the Revolution, but he was not a strong leading figure.

Which period in history is associated with the conditions described in the passage? Choices: a) The Enlightenment b) The Green Revolution c) The Scientific Revolution d) The Industrial Revolution 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements in the passage that suggest a particular period in history. The passage mentions factories, which implies a high level of industrialization, and the fact that children are working in these factories suggests a period of significant economic and social change.
Next, I need to consider the time period in which the passage was written. The passage was written in 1831-32, which is a key date in the history of the Industrial Revolution.
Finally, I need to consider the broader historical context. The Industrial Revolution was a period of significant economic and social change, marked by the development of factories and the growth of urban centers. The conditions described in the passage, including the exploitation of child labor, are consistent with the social and economic conditions of this period.

Choices: a) Latin America has excelled in poetry. b) Latin America had made significant scientific contributions. c) Latin America had a prophecy regarding these events. d) Latin America has had a rich culture for centuries. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of the poem. The poet is expressing pride in the rich cultural heritage of Latin America, particularly its poetic and spiritual traditions.
Next, I need to analyze the specific lines that mention ""our America, that has had poets since ancient times,... that consulted the stars"". The poet is highlighting the long history of poetry and spiritual knowledge in Latin America, dating back to ancient times.
Now, I need to consider the purpose of the poet in mentioning these facts. The poet is not simply listing facts, but is using them to make a point about the cultural superiority of Latin America. The poet is saying that Latin America has a rich cultural heritage that is not recognized by the United States, and that this heritage is a source of pride and strength.

Choice a) Reverence for nature leads to tranquility and peaceful transitions of power. is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention the concept of peaceful transitions of power. Choice c) Intelligence in a Chinese emperor was valued more highly than ethical behavior. is also not supported by the passage, as it does not mention the value placed on intelligence. Choice d) The emperor's ministers were expected to support all of his policies unconditionally. is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention the role of ministers in supporting the emperor's policies.
The passage does mention that the former kings of Xia cultivated their virtue, and their descendants did not follow their example, leading to calamities from Heaven. It also mentions that the king of Shang displayed his sagely prowess by substituting oppression with generous gentleness. This suggests that a ruler's public actions were considered an extension of his private behavior, and that ethical behavior was valued highly. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

""The quicksilver mines of Huancavelica are where the poor Indians are so harshly punished, where they are tortured and so many Indians die; it is there that the noble caciques [headmen] of this kingdom are finished off and tortured. The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]â€¦.The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a yearâ€¦.
And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.
And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubinesâ€¦.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]â€¦at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.
There is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing himâ€¦.Even the protector of the Indians is useless;â€¦he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.""

The production of the mines mentioned in the passage most directly contributed to which of the following in the period 1450â€“1750 C.E.? Choices: a) The prosecution of a variety of wars by the Spanish Hapsburgs across the world b) The development of a vibrant merchant class in Spain c) A decrease in patronage of religious activities by the monarchs of Spain d) A decrease in the frequency of voyages of exploration undertaken by the Spanish 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main topic of the passage, which is the harsh treatment of Indians in the mines of Peru during the Spanish colonial period.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the passage, which is the period of 1450-1750 C.E. during the Spanish colonial period.
Now, I need to analyze the options and determine which one is most directly related to the production of the mines mentioned in the passage. The passage mentions the production of silver in the mines of Potosi and Huancavelica, which were major sources of wealth for the Spanish Empire. The Spanish Hapsburgs used this wealth to finance their military campaigns and wars across the world, including the Thirty Years' War and the Eighty Years' War.

Questions to the passage below, an account given to a French officer in Algeria in the 1830s by a member of an Arab slave trade caravan.
The Slave Trade
All of you [soldiers], are summoned... to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""].... The soldiery divided themselves into two companies... with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields.... Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beardâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negressâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negroâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.30,000 cowries
A young Negress â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦50â€“60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro childâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.35â€“40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women.... It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own.... Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk.... They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.
Which conclusion is supported by the passage? Choices: a) Africans passively accepted their capture and subsequent enslavement. b) North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes. c) Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women. d) Adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength.

The knowledge of anything, since all things have causes, is not acquired or complete unless it is known by its causes. Therefore in medicine we ought to know the causes of sickness and health. And because health and sickness and their causes are sometimes manifest, and sometimes hidden and not to be comprehended except by the study of symptoms, we must also study the symptoms of health and disease. Now it is established in the sciences that no knowledge is acquired save through the study of its causes and beginnings, if it has had causes and beginnings; nor completed except by knowledge of its accidents and accompanying essentials.""

The verse above is best seen as belonging to which of the following modern cultural developments? Choices: a) The triumph of avant-garde literary styles over traditional realism b) The adaptation of Western literary forms by non-Western authors c) The political use of art and literature for propagandistic purposes d) The response of interwar literary figures to the horrors of World War I 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements of the verse. The verse is written in a lyrical and expressive style, with vivid imagery and metaphors. It describes the city of New York in a way that is both sensual and spiritual.
Next, I need to consider the cultural context in which the verse was written. The verse was written by a Senegalese poet, LÃ©opold SÃ©dar Senghor, in 1956. This was a time of great cultural and political change in Africa and the African diaspora.
Now, I need to consider the characteristics of each of the options. Option a) refers to the avant-garde literary styles of the early 20th century, which is not relevant to this verse. Option c) refers to the use of art and literature for political purposes, which is not the primary focus of this verse. Option d) refers to the response of interwar literary figures to the horrors of World War I, which is not relevant to this verse.
The verse is best seen as belonging to option b) The adaptation of Western literary forms by non-Western authors. The verse is written in a style that is influenced by Western literary forms, but it also reflects the cultural and historical context of the African diaspora. The use of imagery and metaphor to describe the city of New York is a characteristic of Western literary forms, but the way in which the verse combines these elements with African cultural references is unique to non-Western authors.

By what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.
Lin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839
Which of the following background facts persuaded Europeans to engage in the actions described in the passage? Choices: a) China had recently placed an embargo on exports of silk. b) The price of Chinese tea had risen higher than European buyers found acceptable. c) China refused to allow a meaningful volume of European goods to be sold there. d) China's emperor had repeatedly insulted the British ambassador. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main issue described in the passage. The main issue is the sale of opium by foreigners to China, which is causing harm to the Chinese people.
Next, I need to consider the possible reasons why Europeans would engage in such actions. The passage mentions that the Europeans are motivated by their ""inordinate thirst after gain"", which suggests that they are driven by financial interests.
Now, I need to evaluate the options in light of this information. Option a) mentions an embargo on silk exports, but this is not mentioned in the passage as a reason for the opium trade. Option b) mentions a rise in the price of Chinese tea, but this is also not mentioned in the passage. Option c) mentions China's refusal to allow European goods to be sold there, which is consistent with the passage's description of China's restrictive trade policies. Option d) mentions insults to the British ambassador, but this is not mentioned in the passage as a reason for the opium trade.

""To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat herâ€“â€“because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploitersâ€“â€“to beat the backward and the weak.

Choices: a) The Space Race with the United States b) The Polish-Soviet War in the early 1920s c) The Western intervention in the Russian Civil War d) The German invasion of Russia in 1941 
Output:
First, I need to identify the historical context of Stalin's speech. Stalin's speech was delivered in 1931, and he mentions the ""continual beatings"" that Russia suffered in the past.
Next, I need to consider the historical events that occurred around that time. The Western intervention in the Russian Civil War (1918-1922) and the Polish-Soviet War (1919-1921) were significant events that Russia faced in the early 20th century.
However, the Space Race with the United States did not occur until the 1950s, and the German invasion of Russia in 1941 was a major event, but it was not a direct result of Russia's backwardness.
The Western intervention in the Russian Civil War and the Polish-Soviet War were both examples of Russia being ""beaten"" by external forces, which Stalin mentions in his speech.

Which of the following religious movements was ideologically opposed to the sentiments about the use of holy images reflected in the passages? Choices: a) Sunni Islam b) Buddhism c) Zoroastrianism d) Jainism 
Output:
First, I need to identify the sentiments about the use of holy images reflected in the passages. The passages suggest that holy images are a way to proclaim and sanctify the divine, and that they can be used to bring understanding and to show the incarnation of the Word of God as real.
Next, I need to consider the religious movements listed in the choices. I need to think about which one of these movements would be ideologically opposed to the use of holy images.
Sunni Islam is a branch of Islam that has a long history of iconoclasm, or the destruction of images, and has been opposed to the use of holy images in worship and devotion. This is in contrast to the sentiments expressed in the passages, which suggest that holy images are a valuable and useful part of religious practice.
Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, and Jainism do not have a strong tradition of iconoclasm, and may even use images in their worship and devotion.

Excerpt from the inscription of Kerdir at Naqsh-e-Rustam, Persia, late third century C.E.
Which of the following best explains the presence of Buddhist communities within Sassanid Persia? Choices: a) Persian efforts to convert people away from Buddhism inspired further followers. b) Buddhism's apocalyptic message swayed converts in Persia. c) Persia's location sat astride international trade routes with India. d) Buddhists were granted limited toleration by Zoroastrians. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the historical context of the Sassanid Empire. The Sassanid Empire was a Zoroastrian empire, and Zoroastrianism was the official state religion.
Next, I need to examine the relationship between the Sassanid Empire and Buddhism. The inscription of Kerdir, which is a primary source, mentions the persecution of various religious groups, including Buddhists, Jews, Hindus, and others.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) suggests that Persian efforts to convert people away from Buddhism inspired further followers, but this is unlikely given the persecution of Buddhists mentioned in the inscription. Option b) suggests that Buddhism's apocalyptic message swayed converts in Persia, but there is no evidence to support this claim. Option c) suggests that Persia's location sat astride international trade routes with India, which would have facilitated the spread of Buddhism, but this does not explain the presence of Buddhist communities within the empire. Option d) suggests that Buddhists were granted limited toleration by Zoroastrians, which is consistent with the historical context and the inscription of Kerdir.

First, I need to understand the context of the treaty. The treaty is about dividing the newly discovered lands in the ocean sea between the King of Portugal and the King of Castile, Aragon, etc.
Next, I need to consider the technologies that could have led to the discovery of these new lands. The compass is a navigation technology that allows for more accurate and efficient navigation, which would have enabled the discovery of new lands.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Gunpowder weapons, steel, and germ theory are not directly related to navigation or exploration. The compass, on the other hand, is a technology that would have enabled the discovery of new lands, which led to the need for the treaty.

Choices: a) The invention of the machine gun b) The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases c) The development of the joint-stock company d) The invention of steam-powered ships 
Output:
First, I need to consider the historical context of European penetration of Africa during the period 1750 to 1900 C.E. This period saw the rise of European colonial empires, and the development of new technologies and economic systems that enabled Europeans to expand their control over Africa.
Next, I need to evaluate the options and consider which one contributed least to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa during this period.
The invention of the machine gun (option a) was a significant factor in European military conquests in Africa, as it allowed European armies to overpower African resistance.
The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases (option b) was also an important factor, as it enabled European colonizers to establish themselves in Africa and reduce the risk of disease.
The development of the joint-stock company (option c) was a key factor in the financing of European colonial ventures, as it allowed investors to pool their resources and share the risks of colonial expansion.
The invention of steam-powered ships (option d) was a significant factor in European maritime trade and colonization, as it enabled Europeans to travel faster and more efficiently across the Atlantic and other oceans.
However, the invention of vaccines for tropical diseases (option b) was not a direct factor in European penetration of Africa, as it was primarily a response to the challenges of European colonization, rather than a means of facilitating it.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
""The greatest contribution that Africa can make to the peace of the world is to avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity, by creating a political union which will also by its success, stand as an example to a divided world. A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.""
Kwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961
Based on the speech, the French saw Africa as which of the following? Choices: a) A collection of republics tottering into anarchy b) A resource for enhancing French power in the Cold War c) Important due to the Sahara's natural resources d) A strong political union 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of the speech. The speech emphasizes the importance of African unity and the need for a political union to project the African personality and command respect from the world.
Next, I need to analyze the passage to determine how the French are portrayed. The passage mentions the French atomic tests in the Sahara, which suggests that the French are seen as having a significant interest in the region.
Now, I need to consider the options and determine which one is most consistent with the passage. The passage does not portray the French as seeing Africa as a collection of republics tottering into anarchy (option a), nor does it suggest that the French see Africa as a strong political union (option d). The passage does suggest that the French are interested in the Sahara's natural resources, but it also implies that the French are more interested in using Africa to enhance their power in the Cold War (option b). Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

""I travelled thence to 'Aden, the port of Yemen, on the coast of the ocean. It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only; it has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God.""
Ibn Battuta, ca. 1325â€“1354 C.E.
Ibn Battuta's experiences were LEAST similar to the experiences of which of the following? Choices: a) Zheng He b) Marco Polo c) Lorenzo de Medici d) Xuanzang 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements of Ibn Battuta's experiences. He traveled to Aden, a port city in Yemen, and observed the local culture, trade, and commerce. He noted the hot climate, the importance of the port, and the wealth of the merchants. He also mentioned the presence of Indian and Egyptian merchants, as well as the piety and generosity of the local inhabitants.
Next, I need to consider the experiences of the other options. Zheng He was a Chinese admiral who led expeditions to Southeast Asia and East Africa, and his experiences would have been similar to Ibn Battuta's in terms of traveling to distant ports and observing local cultures. Marco Polo was a Venetian merchant who traveled to China and observed the Mongol Empire, and his experiences would have been similar to Ibn Battuta's in terms of traveling to distant lands and observing local cultures. Lorenzo de Medici was a Florentine statesman and banker who traveled extensively throughout Europe, but his experiences would have been very different from Ibn Battuta's in terms of the cultures and landscapes he encountered. Xuanzang was a Chinese Buddhist monk who traveled to India and observed the local culture and Buddhism, and his experiences would have been similar to Ibn Battuta's in terms of traveling to distant lands and observing local cultures.
Finally, I need to determine which option is the least similar to Ibn Battuta's experiences. Based on the information provided, Lorenzo de Medici's experiences would have been the least similar to Ibn Battuta's, as he traveled extensively throughout Europe and would not have encountered the same cultures and landscapes as Ibn Battuta.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
""Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighboring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations does not make us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our chief safeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws, particularly such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they are actually on the statute book, or belong to that code which, although unwritten, yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace.""
Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, ca. 415 B.C.E.
Which of the following correctly describes one of the primary reasons that Greek culture was disseminated widely around the Mediterranean region during the time period represented by the passage? Choices: a) The geography of Greece contains many natural resources that facilitated a profitable mining industry. b) The geography of Greece contains numerous freshwater lakes that facilitated a successful fishing industry. c) The geography of Greece contains prominent river valleys that facilitated widespread agriculture. d) The geography of Greece contains many natural harbors that facilitated trade and commerce. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the geographical features of Greece that would facilitate the dissemination of Greek culture. The passage does not mention the geography of Greece, but it does mention the dissemination of Greek culture.
Next, I need to think about the geographical features that would facilitate trade and commerce. A natural harbor would provide a safe place for ships to dock and unload goods, making it easier for people to trade and communicate with one another.
Now, I need to consider the other options. While a profitable mining industry, a successful fishing industry, and widespread agriculture might all contribute to the growth and prosperity of a civilization, they are not as directly related to the dissemination of culture as trade and commerce.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
""Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.""
Nicolo Machiavelli, The Prince, ca. 1513 C.E.
Machiavelli's treatise is best understood in the context of which of the following? Choices: a) A time of burgeoning economic prosperity among the lower classes of Italian society b) A time of increasing religious devotion among the elite Italian scholars c) A time of intense political conflict among warring Italian city-states and other factions d) A time of collegial cooperation between scholars and ecclesiastical authorities in Italy 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context in which Machiavelli wrote The Prince. The treatise is a guide for rulers, and it discusses the nature of power and how to maintain it.
Next, I need to consider the historical context in which Machiavelli lived. Machiavelli was an Italian politician and philosopher who lived during the Renaissance, a time of great change and upheaval in Italy.
During this time, Italy was divided into many small city-states, each with its own ruler, and these city-states were often at war with each other. This created a complex and unstable political environment, where power was constantly shifting and alliances were frequently formed and broken.
Given this context, I believe that the correct answer is c) A time of intense political conflict among warring Italian city-states and other factions. This is because Machiavelli's treatise is best understood in the context of the political instability and conflict that characterized Italy during the Renaissance.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
The passage below is the Chinese emperor's response to English King George III's diplomatic envoys, who were seeking expanded trading privileges (1793).
Strange and costly objects do not interest me. If I have commanded that the tribute offerings sent by you, O King, are to be accepted, this was solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar.... As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures. It behooves you, O King, to display even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity.
How did the Chinese restrict foreign trade during the era 1750â€“1900? Choices: a) European merchants were confined to a few cities designated for foreign trade. b) Only the Dutch traded with China; other Europeans had to use them as intermediaries. c) The Chinese imposed extraordinary tariffs on all foreign products. d) They passed laws intended to persecute and harass foreign residents. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key information in the passage that relates to the question. The passage mentions that the Chinese emperor does not value ""strange or ingenious"" objects and has no use for the English king's country's manufactures.
Next, I need to consider the options provided and determine which one aligns with the information in the passage. The passage does not mention tariffs, persecution, or harassment of foreign residents, so options c and d can be eliminated.
The passage does mention that the Chinese emperor has no use for foreign manufactures, which suggests that the Chinese may not be interested in trading with foreigners. However, it does not explicitly state that European merchants were confined to a few cities or that only the Dutch traded with China.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

Woman, wake up; the bell of reason is being heard throughout the whole universe; discover your rights. Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!
Olympe de Gouges, ""Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,"" 1791
The independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fearâ€”but apart from that, nothing has changed.
Halima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence
Based on both passages, which of the following conclusions can be most reasonably made about revolutions? Choices: a) The new liberties gained by revolution are rarely worth the bloodshed. b) The new liberties gained by revolution typically fail to benefit women or ethnic minorities. c) The new liberties gained by revolution are sometimes distributed unequally or inconsistently. d) The new liberties gained by revolution do not always bring about economic improvement. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the content of the two passages. Olympe de Gouges' passage is a call to action for women to recognize their rights and challenge the injustices they face. She argues that the Revolution has not brought about the desired changes for women, and that they must continue to fight for their rights.
Next, I need to consider Halima Ghomri's passage, which provides a more nuanced view of the impact of revolution. She notes that while the war of independence brought about freedom from fear, it did not bring about significant economic improvements or changes in the lives of peasants.
Now, I need to consider the options and determine which one is most reasonably supported by the passages. Option a) suggests that the new liberties gained by revolution are rarely worth the bloodshed, but this is not explicitly stated in either passage. Option b) suggests that the new liberties gained by revolution typically fail to benefit women or ethnic minorities, but this is not supported by the passages, which suggest that the issue is more complex. Option d) suggests that the new liberties gained by revolution do not always bring about economic improvement, but this is not explicitly stated in either passage. Option c) suggests that the new liberties gained by revolution are sometimes distributed unequally or inconsistently, which is supported by both passages. Olympe de Gouges argues that the Revolution has not brought about the desired changes for women, and Halima Ghomri notes that the war of independence did not bring about significant economic improvements for peasants.

Crosby's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450â€“1750 C.E.? Choices: a) The development of direct trade links between Western Europe and India b) The beginning of the Industrial Revolution c) The colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans d) The increasing development of seafaring technologies 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context of the passage. The passage mentions the idea of a society increasing its productivity by exploiting the resources of other continents, which suggests that the passage is discussing the process of colonization.
Next, I need to consider the time period mentioned in the passage, which is 1450â€“1750 C.E. This time period corresponds to the Age of Exploration and the early stages of colonization.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) The development of direct trade links between Western Europe and India is not directly related to the idea of colonization, as it involves trade rather than the exploitation of resources. Option b) The beginning of the Industrial Revolution is also not directly related, as it refers to a technological development rather than a process of colonization. Option c) The colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans is a direct match for the idea of a society increasing its productivity by exploiting the resources of other continents. Option d) The increasing development of seafaring technologies is a factor that contributed to the colonization of the Americas, but it is not the development that Crosby's argument is responding to.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

Which of the following inferences about religion in the period 1750â€“1900 C.E. is supported by Source 2? Choices: a) Religious uniformity was expected of the citizens of most states in the period. b) Religious toleration gained acceptance with the laws of most states in the period. c) Religious authority was the basis of the divine right of monarchs to rule their states in the period. d) Religious influence on the populations of states declined due to scientific advancements. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the information provided in Source 2, which is the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, passed in 1824.
The Constitution states that the Catholic Apostolic Roman Religion will continue to be the religion of the Empire (Article 5).
However, it also allows followers of other religions to worship within their households or particular houses for that intent, as long as there is nothing indicating this on the exterior of the Temple (Article 5).
This suggests that while the Catholic religion is the official religion, there is also a degree of religious toleration.
Now, I need to consider the other options:
Option a) Religious uniformity was expected of the citizens of most states in the period. This is not supported by Source 2, as it allows for religious toleration.
Option c) Religious authority was the basis of the divine right of monarchs to rule their states in the period. This is not supported by Source 2, as it does not mention the divine right of monarchs.

Next, I need to analyze the language and imagery used in the poem. The speaker describes Latin America as a place of beauty and richness, with a long history and a deep connection to the natural world. The speaker also describes the potential invaders as being ""men of Saxon eyes and barbarous soul,"" implying that they are cold and uncaring.
The speaker also uses imagery and metaphor to convey the idea that Latin America is a vibrant and living entity that will not be easily conquered. The speaker describes Latin America as ""the daughter of the sun,"" and says that it ""lives, you men of Saxon eyes and barbarous soul.""
The speaker also warns the potential invaders to be careful, saying ""Be careful. Viva Spanish America!"" and ""There are a thousand cubs loosed from the Spanish lion."" This suggests that Latin America is not to be underestimated, and that it will fight back if necessary.

Choices: a) A reduction of barriers to trade across international borders b) A secret treaty to maintain the balance of power in Europe c) Reconstruction efforts to rebuild Europe after World War II d) A response to aggression from outside of Western Europe 
Output:
First, I need to understand the main purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty. The treaty is focused on maintaining peace and security in the North Atlantic area, particularly in Europe and North America.
Next, I need to analyze the specific articles of the treaty to determine its main purpose. Article 1 emphasizes the use of peaceful means to settle international disputes, while Article 2 promotes friendly international relations and economic collaboration. However, Article 5 specifically addresses the use of armed force in response to an armed attack.
Now, I need to consider the historical context of the treaty. The treaty was signed in 1949, after World War II, and it was a response to the threat of Soviet expansion in Europe. The treaty was an attempt to maintain the balance of power in Europe and to prevent further aggression from the Soviet Union.

First, I need to analyze the tone of the first passage to understand the motivations behind the British decision to eradicate the sati ritual. The passage expresses a sense of responsibility and horror at the idea of continuing the practice, but also acknowledges the potential risks of stopping it.
Next, I need to consider the language and tone used in the passage. The passage uses words like ""horror"" and ""cruel and untimely end"" to describe the sati ritual, indicating a strong moral objection to the practice. However, the passage also mentions the ""powerful responsibility"" of the decision, suggesting that the British are aware of the potential consequences of their actions.
Now, I need to evaluate the options based on the tone and language used in the passage. Option a) suggests that the British intended to Christianize India's Hindu population, but the passage does not mention anything about Christianity or religious conversion. Option c) suggests that the British were motivated by a concern for women's equality, but the passage does not mention women's rights or equality. Option d) suggests that the British were motivated by a racially prejudiced disdain for all Indian customs, but the passage does not express any general disdain for Indian customs, only a specific objection to the sati ritual.
Based on the tone and language used in the passage, option b) seems to be the most supported supposition. The passage suggests that the British were motivated by a desire to end the sati ritual without endangering their own authority, and that they were aware of the potential risks and consequences of their actions.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

""The greatest contribution that Africa can make to the peace of the world is to avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity, by creating a political union which will also by its success, stand as an example to a divided world. A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.""
Kwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961
The inclusion of the Congo in Nkrumah's argument is intended to do which of the following? Choices: a) Demonstrate the possibility of African unity b) Give an example of how African nations are neglected by the world powers c) Present an illustration of how the development of a constitution brings order to nations d) Blame European powers for the difficulties experienced in Africa 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. Kwame Nkrumah is arguing for African unity and its benefits.
Next, I need to analyze the inclusion of the Congo in the passage. The Congo is mentioned as an example of how the U.N. quibbled about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy.
Now, I need to determine the purpose of including the Congo in the passage. The Congo is used to illustrate how African nations are neglected by the world powers, which supports Nkrumah's argument for African unity.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

""The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries. It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.
Non-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investmentsâ€¦The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.""
Kwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965
Which of the following is referenced by the co-operation mentioned in the second paragraph? Choices: a) The competing ideologies of the Cold War b) The competing ideologies of World War II c) The competing empires of World War I d) The competing colonization companies in the Scramble for Africa 
Output:
First, I need to identify the context of the co-operation mentioned in the second paragraph. The co-operation is mentioned in the context of non-alignment, which is a policy practiced by Ghana and many other countries.
Next, I need to understand the nature of the co-operation. The co-operation involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State.
Now, I need to consider the historical context of the Scramble for Africa. The Scramble for Africa was a period of intense colonization and competition among European powers for control of African territories. The competing colonization companies mentioned in the options are a key aspect of this period.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China
In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
What traditional view of world history does this passage seem to challenge? Choices: a) That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies b) That China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation c) That China was hindered by religious fundamentalism when it came to modernizing efforts d) That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change 
Output:
First, I need to identify the traditional view of world history that the passage seems to challenge. The passage mentions that China devoted its efforts to improving horse archer units, which suggests that China was not focused on gunpowder weapons.
Next, I need to consider the reasons why China might not have focused on gunpowder weapons. The passage mentions that early gunpowder weapons were unwieldy and proved of little utility against highly mobile steppe nomads.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices. Choice a) suggests that China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies, but the passage does not support this view. In fact, the passage suggests that China was able to improve its horse archer units, which implies a high level of technological sophistication. Choice b) suggests that China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation, but the passage does not mention anything about China's form of government. Choice c) suggests that China was hindered by religious fundamentalism when it came to modernizing efforts, but the passage does not mention anything about religion. Choice d) suggests that China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change, which is the opposite of what the passage suggests. The passage suggests that China's focus on horse archer units was a deliberate choice, rather than a lack of attention to technological change.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

The passage below is taken from testimony before Parliament.
Joshua Drake, called in; and Examined.
You say you would prefer moderate labour and lower wages; are you pretty comfortable upon your present wages?
â€”I have no wages, but two days a week at present; but when I am working at some jobs we can make a little, and at others we do very poorly.
When a child gets 3s. a week, does that go much towards its subsistence?
â€”No, it will not keep it as it should do.
Why do you allow your children to go to work at those places where they are ill-treated or over-worked?
â€”Necessity compels a man that has children to let them work.
Then you would not allow your children to go to those factories under the present system, if it was not from necessity?
â€”No.
â€”Testimony given before the Sadler Committee, 1831â€“32
Which type of organization was partially responsible for improving the hours, wages, and working conditions of workers in this era? Choices: a) Guilds b) Joint-stock companies c) Labor unions d) Zaibatsu groups 
Output:
First, I need to identify the context of the testimony. The testimony is given before the Sadler Committee, which suggests that the committee is investigating working conditions and labor practices.
Next, I need to understand the purpose of the Sadler Committee. The committee is likely investigating the treatment of workers, particularly children, in factories and other workplaces.
Now, I need to consider the options. Guilds were organizations of skilled craftsmen that regulated their own trades, but they were not typically involved in improving working conditions or wages. Joint-stock companies were business organizations that raised capital by issuing shares, but they were not typically involved in improving working conditions or wages. Zaibatsu groups were large business conglomerates in Japan, but they were not relevant to the context of the testimony. Labor unions, on the other hand, were organizations of workers that advocated for better wages, working conditions, and hours.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

The passage below is the Chinese emperor's response to English King George III's diplomatic envoys, who were seeking expanded trading privileges (1793).
Strange and costly objects do not interest me. If I have commanded that the tribute offerings sent by you, O King, are to be accepted, this was solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar.... As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures. It behooves you, O King, to display even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity.
Why were the Chinese not interested in expanding trading rights with Great Britain? Choices: a) The Chinese were angry over Britain's interference in their foreign affairs. b) The Chinese had a preexisting exclusive trade agreement with the Dutch. c) They had no interest in the products that Great Britain could provide. d) They were afraid that the British would gain too much influence within China. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main reason for the Chinese emperor's response. The passage states that ""Strange and costly objects do not interest me,"" which suggests that the Chinese emperor is not interested in the products that Great Britain can provide.
Next, I need to consider the other options. Option a) is not mentioned in the passage, and option b) is also not mentioned. Option d) is not supported by the passage, as the emperor's tone is not one of fear or concern.

What was the impact of this process on Europe? Choices: a) The population increased due to the increased diversity of crops. b) The population declined as a result of imported disease. c) The population increased due to New World immigrants. d) The population declined because of famine caused by the mass export of crops. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the impact of the process on Europe. The process refers to the Columbian Exchange, which was the transfer of plants, animals, and cultures between the New World and the Old World.
Next, I need to think about the effects of the Columbian Exchange on Europe. The exchange brought new crops and food sources to Europe, which would likely increase the population due to improved nutrition and food availability.
Now, I need to consider the other options. Option b) is incorrect because the Columbian Exchange was a transfer of crops and animals, not a transfer of diseases. Option c) is incorrect because the New World immigrants were not a significant factor in the population increase in Europe. Option d) is incorrect because the mass export of crops would not have caused famine in Europe.

"Input: This question refers to the following information.
The city of Ghana consists of two towns. One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables.... The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means.... The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms.... He sits... in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols.... On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals.... The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani.
