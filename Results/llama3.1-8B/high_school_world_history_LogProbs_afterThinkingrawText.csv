"Input: This question refers to the following information.
No task is more urgent than that of preserving peace. Without peace our independence means little. The rehabilitation and upbuilding of our countries will have little meaning. Our revolutions will not be allowed to run their course. What can we do? We can do much! We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we! We, the peoples of Asia and Africa, 1.4 billion strong.
Indonesian leader Sukarno, keynote address to the Bandung Conference, 1955
The passage above is most associated with which of the following developments? Choices: a) The formation of the non-aligned movement b) Global disarmanent and nuclear non-proliferation c) The Green Revolution in agriculture d) Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements of the passage. The passage mentions the importance of preserving peace, the need for the voice of reason in world affairs, and the mobilization of the spiritual, moral, and political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the passage. The passage was delivered by Indonesian leader Sukarno in 1955 at the Bandung Conference.
Now, I need to analyze the options in relation to the passage. Option a) The formation of the non-aligned movement is a development that is closely related to the passage. The non-aligned movement was a group of countries that sought to maintain their independence and avoid taking sides in the Cold War. The passage mentions the importance of preserving peace and avoiding the influence of external powers, which is consistent with the goals of the non-aligned movement.
Option b) Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation is not directly related to the passage. While the passage mentions the importance of peace, it does not specifically address the issue of disarmament or nuclear non-proliferation.
Option c) The Green Revolution in agriculture is not related to the passage. The passage is focused on international relations and politics, not agriculture.
Option d) Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology is not directly related to the passage. While the passage mentions the mobilization of the spiritual, moral, and political strength of Asia, it does not specifically advocate for a pan-Asian ideology.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China
In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
The argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history? Choices: a) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other b) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era c) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E. d) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main argument of the passage. The passage discusses the development of gunpowder weapons in Europe and China during the 1200s through the 1400s.
Next, I need to consider the context of the passage. The passage mentions the use of gunpowder weapons in protracted sieges in Europe and their limited utility against mobile steppe nomads in China.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) is not relevant to the passage, as it discusses the sharing of technologies, but the passage focuses on the development of gunpowder weapons in Europe and China. Option c) is also not relevant, as the passage does not discuss the Silk Road or commerce. Option d) is not relevant, as the passage does not mention the medieval climatic optimum or cultural diffusion.
The passage most closely relates to option b) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era. This option is relevant because the passage discusses the development of gunpowder weapons in Europe, which contributed to European military superiority.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
The city of Ghana consists of two towns. One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables.... The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means.... The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms.... He sits... in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols.... On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals.... The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani.

What evidence is there in the passage that Ghanians were engaged, directly or indirectly, in trade with Asia? Choices: a) They kept horses in their court, which would have come from the Mongols. b) The Ghanian king had adopted the Chinese tradition of the kow-tow. c) The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India. d) The people in his court wore silk robes. 
Output:
First, I need to look for any information in the passage that suggests trade with Asia. The passage mentions that the king levies a tax on salt, copper, and other goods, which suggests that these goods are being imported into the country.
Next, I need to consider the origin of these goods. The passage does not mention the origin of the salt, copper, or other goods, but it does mention that the people in the country wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. This suggests that these goods are being imported into the country.
Now, I need to consider the possibility of trade with Asia. The passage does not mention any direct trade with Asia, but it does mention that the king's due is five mithqals from a load of copper and ten mithqals from a load of other goods. This suggests that the goods are being imported from a region where copper and other goods are abundant, which could be Asia.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

Indonesian leader Sukarno, keynote address to the Bandung Conference, 1955
Like numerous other leaders in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, Sukarno attempted, but did not completely succeed, in maintaining a neutral stance during Choices: a) the Arab-Israeli conflict. b) the Korean War. c) the Cold War. d) the Vietnam conflicts. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the context of the speech. The speech is from the Bandung Conference in 1955, which was a conference of non-aligned nations in Asia and Africa.
Next, I need to understand the content of the speech. Sukarno is emphasizing the importance of peace and the need for the people of Asia and Africa to mobilize their strength to support peace.
Now, I need to consider the options. The Arab-Israeli conflict, the Korean War, the Cold War, and the Vietnam conflicts are all significant conflicts in the 20th century. However, the context of the speech suggests that Sukarno is referring to a broader conflict that involves the Cold War.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them.... He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.
—Adapted from U.S. Army Lt. Paul C. McGrath's account of Colonel Bonesteel's decision in the 1940s
How did the events depicted here affect Koreans? Choices: a) They became a part of Japan’s territory. b) The Americans established freedom for all Koreans. c) The Korean economy never recovered. d) Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the events depicted. The events refer to the decision made by Colonel Bonesteel to establish a surrender zone in Korea during the 1940s.
Next, I need to consider the impact of these events on Koreans. The events led to the division of Korea into two zones, with the 38th parallel serving as the hypothetical line dividing the zones.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices. Choice a) They became a part of Japan’s territory. is incorrect because the events depicted do not indicate that Koreans became a part of Japan’s territory. Choice b) The Americans established freedom for all Koreans. is also incorrect because the events depicted do not indicate that the Americans established freedom for all Koreans. Choice c) The Korean economy never recovered. is incorrect because the events depicted do not provide information about the impact of the events on the Korean economy. Choice d) Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel. is the correct answer because the events depicted led to the division of Korea into two zones, with the 38th parallel serving as the hypothetical line dividing the zones.

Both authors below were speaking of the French Revolution.
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal... that things in general were settled for ever.
—A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens
Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive. But to be young was very heaven.
—The Prelude, by William Wordsworth
Dickens's and Wordsworth's differing views about the French Revolution can be described, respectively, by which of the following adjectives? Choices: a) Optimistic, encouraged b) Understanding, accepting c) Cynical, enthusiastic d) Sincere, resigned 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the tone of Dickens's passage. Dickens describes the French Revolution as a time of contradictions, where both good and bad things coexisted. He uses phrases like ""the best of times, the worst of times"" and ""the season of Light, the season of Darkness"" to convey this sense of ambiguity. He also mentions that some people were going to Heaven, while others were going the other way, which suggests a sense of uncertainty and chaos.
Next, I need to analyze the tone of Wordsworth's passage. Wordsworth describes the French Revolution as a time of great joy and excitement, where being young was ""very heaven."" He uses the phrase ""Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive"" to convey a sense of euphoria and optimism.
Now, I need to compare the two tones. Dickens's tone is cynical, as he is skeptical of the French Revolution and its ideals. He sees the Revolution as a time of contradictions and uncertainty. In contrast, Wordsworth's tone is enthusiastic, as he is excited and optimistic about the French Revolution and its potential for change.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

Woman, wake up; the bell of reason is being heard throughout the whole universe; discover your rights. Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!
Olympe de Gouges, ""Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,"" 1791
The independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fear—but apart from that, nothing has changed.

Which of the following observations about revolutions and gender is best supported by the first passage? Choices: a) Revolutionary progressivism does not always concern itself with gender equality. b) Women typically assume leadership roles during times of revolution. c) Women rarely support revolutions and therefore receive little benefit from them. d) Revolutionary movements are generally uninterested in women's rights. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the content of the passage. The passage is a call to action for women to recognize their rights and to oppose the injustices they face. The author, Olympe de Gouges, is advocating for women's rights and equality.
Next, I need to consider the tone and language used in the passage. The author is using strong and emotive language to emphasize the importance of women's rights and to encourage women to take action.
Now, I need to evaluate the options based on the analysis. Option a) is supported by the passage, as it highlights the fact that women's rights are not always a priority in revolutionary movements. Option b) is not supported, as there is no indication that women are assuming leadership roles. Option c) is not supported, as the passage suggests that women are actively involved in the revolution and are advocating for their rights. Option d) is not supported, as the passage suggests that revolutionary movements can be a catalyst for change and that women's rights are an important aspect of this change.

""The question as to who, and what, is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels. Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.""

Which of the following best explains the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.? Choices: a) Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs. b) Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms. c) Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves. d) Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the question, which is about the period 1450 to 1750 C.E. and the impact of European trading contacts on Sub-Saharan Africans.
Next, I need to analyze the options given and determine which one best explains the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans during this period.
Option a) suggests that Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the importation of New World foodstuffs. However, this is not accurate, as the New World foodstuffs were not introduced until the Columbian Exchange, which occurred after 1750 C.E.
Option b) suggests that Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with Europeans for firearms. This is a plausible explanation, as the introduction of firearms would have given Sub-Saharan Africans a significant advantage over their neighbors and allowed them to expand their territories.
Option c) suggests that Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves. While it is true that the transatlantic slave trade was a significant aspect of European-African trade during this period, it is not the most accurate explanation of the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans.
Option d) suggests that Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty. This is not a plausible explanation, as there is no evidence to suggest that Sub-Saharan Africans were allied with European powers against Muslim and Arab merchant princes.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

""It is impossible to demand that an impossible position should be cleared up by peaceful revision and at the same time constantly reject peaceful revision. It is also impossible to say that he who undertakes to carry out these revisions for himself transgresses a law, since the Versailles ""Diktat"" is not law to us. A signature was forced out of us with pistols at our head and with the threat of hunger for millions of people. And then this document, with our signature, obtained by force, was proclaimed as a solemn law.""

What is the historical background for Adolf Hitler's condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles mentioned in Source 1? Choices: a) Hitler's belief that Poland's territorial borders should not be violated b) A rising intolerance of ethnic and political minority groups c) A widespread belief in Germany that it had been unfairly treated at the end of World War I d) Hitler's attempted collaboration with Italian leader Benito Mussolini 
Output:
First, I need to identify the historical context of the Treaty of Versailles. The Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919 after World War I, and it imposed harsh penalties on Germany, including significant territorial losses and reparations.
Next, I need to consider the sentiment expressed by Adolf Hitler in Source 1. Hitler is expressing a sense of injustice and resentment towards the Treaty of Versailles, which he claims was imposed on Germany through force and coercion.
Now, I need to evaluate the options in light of this context. Option a) is incorrect because Hitler's condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles is not related to Poland's territorial borders. Option b) is also incorrect because while Hitler's regime did exhibit intolerance towards minority groups, this is not the historical background for his condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles. Option d) is incorrect because Hitler's attempted collaboration with Mussolini is not relevant to the historical background for his condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles.

In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.
British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860
Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.
Rudrangshu Mukherjee, ""The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,"" 1990
According to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre Choices: a) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms. b) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India. c) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression. d) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the Cawnpore Massacre. The passage mentions that the massacre was a result of a revolt against British colonial rule in India.
Next, I need to analyze the reasons behind the revolt. The passage states that the revolt was a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) suggests that the massacre was justifiable according to local military custom, but this is not mentioned in the passage. Option c) suggests that the massacre should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression, but this is not a neutral or objective perspective. Option d) suggests that the massacre was the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy, but this is not mentioned in the passage.

Joshua Drake, called in; and Examined.
You say you would prefer moderate labour and lower wages; are you pretty comfortable upon your present wages?
—I have no wages, but two days a week at present; but when I am working at some jobs we can make a little, and at others we do very poorly.
When a child gets 3s. a week, does that go much towards its subsistence?
—No, it will not keep it as it should do.
Why do you allow your children to go to work at those places where they are ill-treated or over-worked?
—Necessity compels a man that has children to let them work.
Then you would not allow your children to go to those factories under the present system, if it was not from necessity?
—No.
—Testimony given before the Sadler Committee, 1831–32
According to the passage, why does the witness allow his children to work in a place where they will be ill-treated? Choices: a) A factory owner is forcing him to do so. b) He doesn’t earn enough on his own. c) The children need discipline. d) Their labor is only moderately difficult. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. The passage is a testimony given before the Sadler Committee in 1831-32, which suggests that the topic is related to labor and working conditions.
Next, I need to identify the key information provided by the witness. The witness states that he allows his children to work in places where they are ill-treated or over-worked because of necessity.
Now, I need to analyze the possible reasons for the witness's decision. The witness does not mention a factory owner forcing him to do so (a), nor does he mention that the children need discipline (c), or that their labor is only moderately difficult (d). However, he does mention that he doesn't earn enough on his own (b), which suggests that he is struggling to provide for his children and is forced to allow them to work in difficult conditions due to financial necessity.

Which best describes the relationship between the United States and the Soviets as depicted in the passage? Choices: a) Uneasy allies b) Comrades-in-arms c) Mortal enemies d) Distant strangers 
Output:
First, I need to identify the tone of the passage. The passage describes the situation as a problem that the United States needs to solve, and it mentions that the United States would be unable to stop the Soviets if they refused to confine their advance to north Korea. This suggests that the relationship between the United States and the Soviets is tense and potentially hostile.
Next, I need to consider the context of the passage. The passage is discussing a military situation, and it mentions the movement of troops and the surrender of Japanese forces. This suggests that the relationship between the United States and the Soviets is one of military adversaries.
Finally, I need to consider the language used in the passage. The passage describes the Soviets as ""the Russians,"" which is a formal and somewhat distant term. It also mentions that the United States would be unable to stop the Soviets, which suggests a sense of powerlessness and vulnerability. This language suggests that the relationship between the United States and the Soviets is one of distant strangers, but with a sense of tension and hostility.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

Letter from a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War, South Africa, 1879
Incidents such as those described by the author of the letter were used by the British government to do which of the following? Choices: a) Issue a casus belli to go to war with the Kingdom of Zulu b) Tax the Zulu kingdom to cover damages attributed to them c) Sever its responsibility to protect citizens who chose to live in South Africa d) Liberate the Zulus from British colonialism 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the letter. The letter is written by a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War in South Africa in 1879.
Next, I need to identify the purpose of the letter. The letter describes the damage caused by a contingent of 1,500 natives to the writer's property and mentions that the insurance companies will not make good the damage.
Now, I need to analyze the options. Option a) Issue a casus belli to go to war with the Kingdom of Zulu is a plausible reason for the British government to use incidents like the one described in the letter. The letter describes the damage caused by the natives, which could be used as a pretext for war. Option b) Tax the Zulu kingdom to cover damages attributed to them is also a possible reason, as the British government might use the damage as a reason to impose taxes on the Zulu kingdom. Option c) Sever its responsibility to protect citizens who chose to live in South Africa is not a likely reason, as the British government would likely want to protect its citizens, not abandon them. Option d) Liberate the Zulus from British colonialism is the opposite of what the British government would want to do, so it is not a plausible reason.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

""The greatest contribution that Africa can make to the peace of the world is to avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity, by creating a political union which will also by its success, stand as an example to a divided world. A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.""
Kwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961
Nkrumah's argument in the passage most clearly supports which of the following ideologies? Choices: a) Pan-Africanism b) Communism c) African socialism d) Neocolonialism 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of Nkrumah's argument. He is advocating for a political union of African states, which he believes will project the African personality and command respect from the world.
Next, I need to consider the ideologies listed in the choices. Pan-Africanism is a movement that advocates for unity and solidarity among African nations, which aligns with Nkrumah's argument.
Now, I need to evaluate the other options. Communism is an ideology that advocates for a classless society, which is not mentioned in the passage. African socialism is an ideology that combines elements of socialism and African culture, but it is not directly related to Nkrumah's argument. Neocolonialism is an ideology that advocates for the continuation of colonialism in a new form, which is the opposite of Nkrumah's argument.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.""
Mao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955
Which of the following best explains Mao's concept of the ""socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture"" in China? Choices: a) Agriculture fueled industrialization in cities as excess labor flowed from the countryside to urban centers. b) Agricultural surpluses allowed the state to invest more heavily in modernizing agricultural production. c) Agricultural efficiency reduced prices of basic commodities, raising the standard of living across the whole of China. d) Agriculture was collectivized, with the result that entire communities shared fields instead of individuals owning the land as private property. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. Mao Zedong is discussing the issue of polarization in the countryside, where some peasants are becoming rich while others are struggling to make ends meet.
Next, I need to identify the key concept that Mao is trying to address. He mentions the need for a ""new basis"" to solve the problem, which involves the ""socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture.""
Now, I need to analyze the options to see which one best explains Mao's concept. Option a) mentions the flow of labor from the countryside to urban centers, but this is not directly related to the socialist transformation of agriculture. Option b) mentions the state investing in modernizing agricultural production, but this is not explicitly stated in the passage. Option c) mentions the reduction of prices of basic commodities, but this is not the main focus of the passage. Option d) mentions the collectivization of agriculture, which is the most relevant to the concept of socialist transformation.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

The condition of foreign states is not what it once was; they have invented the steamship, and introduced radical changes in the art of navigation. They have also built up their armies to a state of great efficiency and are possessed of war implements of great power and precision, in short have license to be formidable powers. If, therefore, we persistently cling to our antiquated systems, heaven only knows what a mighty calamity may befall our Empire.
—Adapted from a letter written by Lord Ii to Lord Tokugawa, 1847
Which event or period in Japan's history best reflects Lord Ii's concerns? Choices: a) The expulsion of Christian missionaries from Japan b) The adoption of Chinese imperial customs in the Japanese court c) The annexation of Manchuria by the Japanese d) Commodore Perry forcing Japan to open its ports to trade 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements in the passage that indicate the time period in question. The passage mentions the steamship, radical changes in navigation, and the introduction of war implements of great power and precision. These elements suggest that the time period is relatively modern.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of Japan during the 19th century. The passage mentions the Empire, which suggests that Japan was a unified country at the time. This is consistent with the Meiji period, which began in 1868 and saw the modernization of Japan.
Finally, I need to consider the events that occurred during the Meiji period. The passage mentions the introduction of Western technology and the modernization of the military, which is consistent with the Meiji period. Therefore, the event or period in Japan's history that best reflects Lord Ii's concerns is the Meiji Restoration, which is not listed as an option. However, the closest option is the annexation of Manchuria by the Japanese, which occurred in 1931 and is not relevant to the passage. However, the event that best reflects Lord Ii's concerns is the event that occurred in 1853, when Commodore Perry forced Japan to open its ports to trade. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

""The real grievance of the worker is the insecurity of his existence; he is not sure that he will always have work, he is not sure that he will always be healthy, and he foresees that he will one day be old and unfit to work. If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.""
Otto von Bismarck, 1884
The long-term effects of Otto von Bismarck's speech include which of the following? Choices: a) Development of socialized programs throughout much of Europe b) Disunity of the German states c) Communist overhaul of the eastern parts of Germany d) A decrease in German economic output 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context of the speech. Otto von Bismarck was the Prime Minister of Prussia and later the Chancellor of Germany, and he was known for his efforts to unify Germany and improve the lives of its citizens.
Next, I need to analyze the content of the speech. Bismarck is expressing concern about the insecurity of workers' lives and the lack of support for them in times of need. He is highlighting the need for a more comprehensive system of social support.
Now, I need to consider the long-term effects of Bismarck's speech. Given the context and content of the speech, it is likely that Bismarck's speech contributed to the development of socialized programs throughout much of Europe. This is because Bismarck's speech was a call to action for governments to provide more support for workers, and his efforts led to the establishment of the first social insurance programs in Germany.

This ruler of Syria made me spend many years as commander of his army,
Every land to which I turned
I overcame.
I destroyed its green fields and its wells,
I captured its cattle, I took captive its inhabitants, I deprived them of their provisions,
and I slew [many] people…by my sword, my bow, my marchings, and my good devices.
Thus my excellence was in his heart; he loved me and he knew my valor;
…he set me at the head of his sons, when he saw the success of my handiwork.
There came a champion of Syria
to defy me in my tent;
a bold man without equal, for he had vanquished all his rivals.
He said, ""Let Sanehat fight with me.""
He thought to overcome me; he designed to take my cattle, thus being counseled by his tribe.
The Tale of Sanehat, Egyptian poem written during the Middle Kingdom, ca.1800 B.C.E.
The text of this passage is best seen as evidence of which of the following in Egyptian society? Choices: a) Meritocratic appointments by rulers to their bureaucracies b) Long-distance contact between Egypt and other lands c) The clan as the basic political unit d) A lack of emphasis on martial ability 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the passage to understand its content. The passage describes a ruler of Syria who made the speaker spend many years as commander of his army. The speaker claims to have overcome every land they turned to, destroyed its green fields and wells, captured its cattle, taken captive its inhabitants, deprived them of their provisions, and slew many people.
Next, I need to identify the key points in the passage that relate to Egyptian society. The passage mentions the ruler of Syria, which suggests long-distance contact between Egypt and other lands. The speaker is appointed as commander of the army, which implies meritocratic appointments by rulers to their bureaucracies. The passage also mentions the speaker's excellence and valor, which suggests that martial ability is valued.
Finally, I need to evaluate the options based on the key points I identified. Option a) Meritocratic appointments by rulers to their bureaucracies is supported by the passage, as the speaker is appointed as commander of the army. Option b) Long-distance contact between Egypt and other lands is also supported, as the passage mentions the ruler of Syria. Option c) The clan as the basic political unit is not supported, as there is no mention of clans in the passage. Option d) A lack of emphasis on martial ability is not supported, as the passage highlights the speaker's martial ability and valor.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on.
A soldier says simply: ""They call up more every day.
""Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
""But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.""

Based on the poem and your knowledge of history, Tang relations with western nomadic peoples and frontier peoples relied on which of the following? Choices: a) Adroit diplomacy and establishment of client relationships with bordering nomads b) The ability of the Tang emperor to project military power on the frontier in order to impose his will c) The permanent settlement of Han Chinese in frontier zones d) The payment of tribute to nomadic rulers 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the poem. The poem is about the hardships faced by soldiers in the Tang dynasty, particularly those from the Shanxi region who are being conscripted into the army.
Next, I need to analyze the poem's content. The poem mentions the constant wars and bloodshed on the frontier, the difficulties faced by the soldiers, and the hardships faced by the people in the frontier zones.
Now, I need to consider the historical context of the Tang dynasty. The Tang dynasty was a period of significant expansion and military campaigns, particularly in the western regions.
Based on the poem and my knowledge of history, I believe that the correct answer is b) The ability of the Tang emperor to project military power on the frontier in order to impose his will. This is because the poem highlights the constant wars and bloodshed on the frontier, and the difficulties faced by the soldiers in imposing the emperor's will on the nomadic peoples.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

At the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated.... The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions... a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.
—Robert Guisepi, 1992
The Mongol empire used which of the following to integrate its vast, geographically diverse area? Choices: a) Emphasis on trade networks b) Expansion of bureaucracy to reinforce dominance c) The use of state-sponsored religion to legitimize the government d) Expansion of an interregional canal system 
Output:
First, I need to consider the geographical diversity of the Mongol empire. The empire was vast and covered a large portion of the Eastern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.
Next, I need to think about the characteristics of the Mongol empire. The Mongols were a nomadic people who valued mobility and flexibility, and they did not have a strong centralized government.
Now, I need to consider the options. Option a) Emphasis on trade networks is a good fit for the Mongol empire. The Mongols were known for their ability to facilitate trade and commerce across their vast territory, and they established a network of trade routes that connected different regions of the empire.
Option b) Expansion of bureaucracy to reinforce dominance is not a good fit for the Mongol empire. The Mongols did not have a strong centralized government, and they did not rely on a large bureaucracy to maintain control.
Option c) The use of state-sponsored religion to legitimize the government is not a good fit for the Mongol empire. The Mongols were tolerant of different religions and did not use a single state-sponsored religion to legitimize their government.
Option d) Expansion of an interregional canal system is not a good fit for the Mongol empire. The Mongols were a nomadic people who valued mobility and flexibility, and they did not rely on a complex system of canals to maintain control.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

This great purity of the French Revolution is precisely what causes both our strength and our weakness. Our strength, because it gives to us rights of the public interest over private interests; our weakness, because it rallies all vicious men against us. We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or perish with it; now in this situation, the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror. Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible; it is therefore an emanation of virtue; it is not so much a special principle as it is a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to our country's most urgent needs.

With which of the following threats does the speaker in the passage above seem most concerned? Choices: a) Counterrevolutionary opponents b) Foreign invaders c) Communist agitators d) Transnational corporations 
Output:
First, I need to identify the context of the passage. The passage is about the French Revolution and the speaker is Maximilien Robespierre, a French revolutionary leader.
Next, I need to understand the speaker's concerns. The speaker mentions ""internal and external enemies of the Republic"" and states that the first maxim of policy should be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror.
Now, I need to analyze the options. The speaker is concerned with threats to the French Revolution, which is a democratic movement. The options a) Counterrevolutionary opponents and b) Foreign invaders are both threats to a democratic movement. Option c) Communist agitators is not relevant to the context of the passage, as the French Revolution was a democratic movement, not a communist one. Option d) Transnational corporations is not relevant to the context of the passage, as the French Revolution was a 18th-century event and transnational corporations did not exist at that time.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them.... He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.
—Adapted from U.S. Army Lt. Paul C. McGrath's account of Colonel Bonesteel's decision in the 1940s
Which U.S. cold war policy, developed later, is consistent with the U.S. concern over limiting how much Korean territory the Soviet Union would occupy? Choices: a) Détente b) Mutual Assured Destruction c) Dollar Diplomacy d) Containment 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the question. The question refers to a historical event in which Colonel Bonesteel established a surrender zone in Korea to prevent the Soviet Union from occupying too much territory.
Next, I need to identify the U.S. cold war policy that is consistent with the U.S. concern over limiting how much Korean territory the Soviet Union would occupy. The policy that is consistent with this concern is containment, which is the policy of preventing the spread of communism.
Now, I need to evaluate the other options to see if they are consistent with the U.S. concern. Détente is a policy of relaxation of tensions, mutual assured destruction is a policy of nuclear deterrence, and dollar diplomacy is a policy of using economic power to influence foreign policy. None of these policies are consistent with the U.S. concern over limiting how much Korean territory the Soviet Union would occupy.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.
As we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women's liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation.

What economic practice is referred to by the phrase ""his Indians"" in the quote? Choices: a) Slavery b) Indentured servitude c) The encomienda system d) The apprentice system 
Output:
First, I need to identify the context of the quote. The quote mentions a Spanish nobleman and his Indians, which suggests a relationship between the nobleman and the Indians.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the quote. The quote is from 1972, but it refers to the time of the Spanish conquest of the Americas.
Now, I need to analyze the options. Slavery (a) is a system in which people are owned and forced to work against their will. Indentured servitude (b) is a system in which people are contracted to work for a set period of time in exchange for passage to a new country. The encomienda system (c) is a system in which the Spanish crown granted land and labor to Spanish nobles in exchange for their loyalty and military service. The apprentice system (d) is a system in which young people are trained in a trade in exchange for room and board.
Based on the context and the options, I believe that the encomienda system (c) is the correct answer. The quote mentions a Spanish nobleman and his Indians, which suggests a relationship of ownership and control, which is consistent with the encomienda system.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God.""

Which of the following led directly to the development of the economic system described in the journal? Choices: a) Military campaigns b) Meteorological phenomena c) Competition with European trade networks d) The presence of highly developed port cities 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key characteristics of the economic system described in the journal. The system is based on trade, with merchants playing a central role. The merchants are described as being rich, pious, humble, upright, and generous, and they treat strangers well and give liberally to devotees.
Next, I need to consider the factors that could have led to the development of this economic system. Military campaigns (a) might have led to the expansion of trade routes, but they do not directly explain the development of the economic system described in the journal. Meteorological phenomena (b) are not mentioned in the journal, and they do not seem to be relevant to the development of the economic system. Competition with European trade networks (c) is not mentioned in the journal, and it is not clear how it would have led to the development of the economic system described.
Finally, I need to consider the presence of highly developed port cities (d). The journal describes Aden as a port city with a large number of merchants, porters, and fishermen. The city is described as being surrounded by mountains, with no crops, trees, or water, but with reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. This suggests that the city's economy is based on trade, with merchants bringing goods to the city and selling them to other merchants or to the local population. The presence of highly developed port cities would have provided a favorable environment for the development of the economic system described in the journal.

While some theorists in the Middle Ages argued that the jihad was a defensive war… most authorities held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam. The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or ""Sea of Precious Virtues,"" written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.

These two passages are best understood in the context of which of the following? Choices: a) The influence of religion on interaction between cultures b) The use of religion to justify armed violence c) The syncretic fusion of different religious traditions d) The attempt of a religious group to proselytize to those following another faith 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the two passages. The first passage describes the obligation of jihad and the duty of a Muslim ruler to prosecute it, implying that the use of religion is used to justify armed violence.
Next, I need to analyze the second passage, which describes the kindness and respect shown to Muslim hermits by Christian merchants, suggesting a peaceful and respectful interaction between cultures.
Now, I need to consider the options and determine which one best fits the context of the two passages. The first passage suggests that the use of religion is used to justify armed violence, while the second passage suggests a peaceful interaction between cultures. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

""The question as to who, and what, is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels. Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.""

Which of the following would best support the author's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment? Choices: a) The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations b) The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market c) The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company d) The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key claim made by the author, which is that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment.
Next, I need to consider what evidence would support this claim. The author suggests that the operation of the imperialist system, which includes the exploitation of African wealth, is responsible for African underdevelopment.
Now, I need to evaluate the options to see which one best supports the author's claim. Option a) The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations, suggests that Western European capitalists were involved in the exploitation of African labor, which is consistent with the author's claim.

In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.
British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860
Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.
Rudrangshu Mukherjee, ""The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,"" 1990
In the short term, the events discussed in both passages led to which of the following outcomes? Choices: a) The expulsion of the British East India Company and partial home rule for India b) British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company c) Indian military success and the attainment of full independence from British authority d) The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context of the passages. Both passages describe the Cawnpore massacres and the Indian Rebellion of 1857, which was a major uprising against British rule in India.
Next, I need to analyze the tone and content of the passages. The passages describe the violence and brutality of the British rule in India and the Indian response to it. They also highlight the racial and religious tensions that led to the rebellion.
Now, I need to consider the possible outcomes of the events described in the passages. Given the context and tone of the passages, it is clear that the Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a significant challenge to British rule in India. However, the passages do not suggest that the Indians were successful in achieving their goals or that the British were forced to grant them independence.
Therefore, the most likely outcome is that the British were able to suppress the rebellion and maintain their control over India. This is consistent with the historical record, which shows that the British were ultimately able to quell the rebellion and continue their rule in India.

The passage states that a woman should ""rise early to duties"" and ""not refuse to perform domestic duties whether easy or difficult."" This suggests that women are expected to be responsible for domestic work.
Next, I need to consider the broader implications of these expectations. The passage implies that women's primary role is to serve their husbands and maintain a good reputation within their community.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices in light of these expectations. Choice a) That they obediently fulfill their obligations within the home is consistent with the passage's emphasis on women's domestic responsibilities.
Choice b) That they collaborate with their husbands on domestic tasks is not explicitly stated in the passage, and may even be seen as contradicting the passage's emphasis on women's independent responsibility for domestic work.
Choice c) That they pursue education in order to find meaningful employment is not mentioned in the passage at all, and may even be seen as contradicting the passage's emphasis on women's domestic roles.
Choice d) That they speak their minds boldly is not mentioned in the passage, and may even be seen as contradicting the passage's emphasis on women's obedience and humility.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

The following poem refers to an incident in Sharpeville, South Africa, in 1960. To protest the requirement that they carry papers documenting their identity and residence, black South Africans gathered in front of police stations without their papers. Though other protests ended peacefully, in Sharpeville, police fired into the crowd.
What is important
about Sharpeville
is not that seventy died:
nor even that they were shot in the back
retreating, unarmed, defenceless
and certainty not
the heavy caliber slug
that tore through a mother's back
and ripped through the child in her arms
killing it
Remember Sharpeville
bullet-in-the-back day
Because it epitomized oppression
and the nature of society
More clearly than anything else;
it was the classic event
Nowhere is racial dominance
more clearly defined
nowhere the will to oppress
more clearly demonstrated
What the world whispers
apartheid declares with snarling guns
the blood the rich lust after
South Africa spills dust
Remember Sharpeville
Remember bullet-in-the-back day
And remember the unquenchable will for freedom
Remember the dead
and be glad
—Dennis Brutus, 1973

Both authors below were speaking of the French Revolution.
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal... that things in general were settled for ever.

The intellectual foundations of the eighteenth-century political revolutions were based on Choices: a) the Reformation b) mercantilism c) the Enlightenment d) the Reconquista 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key phrases that indicate the time period being referred to. The phrases ""the French Revolution"" and ""the eighteenth-century political revolutions"" suggest that the correct answer is related to this time period.
Next, I need to consider the options provided and determine which one is most closely associated with the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment was a period of intellectual and philosophical transformation that took place in the 17th and 18th centuries, and it had a significant impact on the French Revolution and other political revolutions of the time.
Finally, I need to eliminate the other options. The Reformation was a 16th-century movement that emphasized the authority of the Bible, mercantilism was an economic theory that emerged in the 16th century, and the Reconquista was a medieval period of Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula. None of these options are closely associated with the Enlightenment or the French Revolution.

While some theorists in the Middle Ages argued that the jihad was a defensive war… most authorities held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam. The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or ""Sea of Precious Virtues,"" written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.
Robert Irwin, ""Islam and the Crusades,"" 1995
It is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them. Likewise, not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories.
Ibn Jubayr, Muslim scholar, traveling to Mecca and Jerusalem, ca. 1185
The first passage tends to support which of the following traditional historical assumptions? Choices: a) That the majority of Muslims were more peaceful than Christians during the crusading era b) That most Muslims were interested only in protecting their own territory during the crusading era c) That many Muslims during the crusading era were driven by Islamic faith to be inherently violent d) That the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of the first passage. The passage states that most authorities in the Middle Ages held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam, and that a Muslim ruler who did not prosecute the jihad was considered corrupt.
Next, I need to consider the implications of this idea. If most authorities believed that the obligation of jihad was ongoing, it suggests that the idea of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era.
Finally, I need to evaluate the options. Option d) is the only one that is supported by the passage. The passage does not provide information about the peacefulness of Muslims compared to Christians (option a), the interest of Muslims in protecting their own territory (option b), or the inherent violence of Muslims (option c).
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

""From the confines of Jerusalem and the city of Constantinople a horrible tale has gone forth and very frequently has been brought to our ears, namely, that a race from the kingdom of the Persians, an accursed race, a race utterly alienated from God, a generation forsooth which has not directed its heart and has not entrusted its spirit to God, has invaded the lands of those Christians and has depopulated them by the sword, pillage and fire; it has led away a part of the captives into its own country, and a part it has destroyed by cruel tortures; it has either entirely destroyed the churches of God or appropriated them for the rites of its own religion….The kingdom of the Greeks is now dismembered by them and deprived of territory so vast in extent that it cannot be traversed in a march of two months. On whom therefore is the labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering this territory incumbent, if not upon you? You, upon whom above other nations God has conferred remarkable glory in arms, great courage, bodily activity, and strength to humble the hairy scalp of those who resist you.
Let the deeds of your ancestors move you and incite your minds to manly achievements; the glory and greatness of king Charles the Great, and of his son Louis, and of your other kings, who have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans, and extended in these lands the territory of the holy church. Let the holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior, which is possessed by unclean nations, especially incite you, and the holy places which are now treated with ignominy and irreverently polluted with their filthiness. Oh, most valiant soldiers and descendants of invincible ancestors, be not degenerate, but recall the valor of your progenitors.
Jerusalem is the navel of the world; the land is fruitful above others, like another paradise of delights. This the Redeemer of the human race has made illustrious by His advent, has beautified by residence, has consecrated by suffering, has redeemed by death, has glorified by burial. This royal city, therefore, situated at the center of the world, is now held captive by His enemies, and is in subjection to those who do not know God, to the worship of the heathens. She seeks therefore and desires to be liberated and does not cease to implore you to come to her aid. From you especially she asks succor, because, as we have already said, God has conferred upon you above all nations great glory in arms. Accordingly undertake this journey for the remission of your sins, with the assurance of the imperishable glory of the kingdom of heaven.""
Pope Urban II, Speech at the Council of Clermont as recorded by Robert the Monk, 1095 C.E.
Which of the following events most directly inspired Urban's invocation of Constantinople in the first paragraph? Choices: a) The conquest of Constantinople by the armies of the Abbasid Caliphate b) The invasion of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks c) The invasion of the Balkans by the Avars and Bulgars d) The conversion of the people of Constantinople to Catholic Christianity 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key information in the first paragraph of the speech. The key information is that a race from the kingdom of the Persians has invaded the lands of Christians and has depopulated them by the sword, pillage, and fire.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the speech. The speech was given in 1095 C.E. and refers to the kingdom of the Greeks, which is now dismembered by the invaders.
Now, I need to consider the possible events that could have inspired Urban's invocation of Constantinople. The conquest of Constantinople by the armies of the Abbasid Caliphate (choice a) is unlikely, as it occurred in 1204 C.E. The invasion of the Balkans by the Avars and Bulgars (choice c) is also unlikely, as it occurred in the 6th and 7th centuries C.E. The conversion of the people of Constantinople to Catholic Christianity (choice d) is not mentioned in the speech and is unlikely to have inspired Urban's invocation of Constantinople.
The invasion of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks (choice b) is the most likely event to have inspired Urban's invocation of Constantinople. The Seljuk Turks had been invading Anatolia since the 11th century C.E. and had recently captured the city of Nicaea in 1081 C.E. This would have been a significant threat to the Byzantine Empire and would have inspired Urban to invoke the need for military action to protect the Christians of the region.

Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!
What's this that you have done?
Is 't not a very naughty thing
To snatch the kaiser's crown?
Now you will have to stay away
Alike from Rhine and Prague,
And more than that-shame and dismay
Your days and nights will plague.
Right well you knew, and all the world,
Right well they know this thing,
That Ferdinand alone can be
Bohemia's lawful king.
So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go
To Ferdinand, your king,
And beg him graciously to show
Full pardon for your sin.
""Poor Winter King,"" seventeenth-century song
Which of the following is an important underlying issue in this song? Choices: a) Rules of royal succession b) Religious conflict c) Military stalemate d) Social class conflicts 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main theme of the song. The song is about the Winter King, who has done something wrong and is being punished.
Next, I need to understand the context of the song. The song is set in the 17th century, and it mentions the Kaiser and the king of Bohemia, which suggests that it is about a conflict between European powers.
Now, I need to analyze the lyrics to determine the underlying issue. The song mentions the Winter King snatching the Kaiser's crown, which suggests a conflict over royal succession. The song also mentions Ferdinand as the lawful king of Bohemia, which further supports this interpretation.

In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.
British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860
Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.
Rudrangshu Mukherjee, ""The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,"" 1990
The passages above can best be connected with which of the following forms of violence? Choices: a) Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown b) Killing of civilians during wartime c) Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction d) State-sponsored campaigns of genocide 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passages. The passages describe the Cawnpore massacres, which occurred during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The passages highlight the brutality and violence of the massacres, particularly the fact that they were perpetrated by a subject race against their masters.
Next, I need to analyze the forms of violence listed in the choices. Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown (a) refers to violence committed by individuals or groups in response to economic or social grievances. Killing of civilians during wartime (b) refers to violence against non-combatants during armed conflict. Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction (c) refers to unintended harm or damage caused by military actions. State-sponsored campaigns of genocide (d) refer to violence committed by a government or state against a particular group of people, often with the intention of eliminating them.
Now, I need to determine which form of violence is most closely related to the passages. The passages describe a violent conflict between a subject race and their masters, with the subject race committing atrocities against their oppressors. This is not a case of banditry due to socio-economic breakdown, as the violence is not driven by economic or social grievances. It is also not a case of collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction, as the violence is not a result of military actions. While the killing of civilians during wartime (b) is a relevant category, it is not the most accurate description of the violence described in the passages. The most accurate description is state-sponsored campaigns of genocide (d), as the violence is committed by a subject race against their masters, with the intention of eliminating them.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

Although in Protestant Europe, [Peter the Great] was surrounded by evidence of the new civil and political rights of individual men embodied in constitutions, bills of rights and parliaments, he did not return to Russia determined to share power with his people. On the contrary, he returned not only determined to change his country but also convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force. He would try to lead; but where education and persuasion were not enough, he could drive—and if necessary flog—the backward nation forward.

Based on the above passage, what kinds of reforms did Peter the Great embrace? Choices: a) Creation of an elected assembly b) Declarations of human rights c) Development of a constitutional monarchy d) Reduction of aristocratic influence 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key information in the passage. The passage mentions that Peter the Great was surrounded by evidence of new civil and political rights of individual men in Protestant Europe, but it does not indicate that he was interested in sharing power with his people.
Next, I need to analyze the passage to determine what kind of reforms Peter the Great embraced. The passage states that Peter the Great was determined to change his country and provide both the direction and the motive force, which suggests that he was interested in implementing reforms that would allow him to maintain control.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices based on the information in the passage. The passage does not mention the creation of an elected assembly, declarations of human rights, or the development of a constitutional monarchy. However, it does suggest that Peter the Great was interested in reducing the influence of the aristocracy, as he was determined to drive and flog the backward nation forward.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

""The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.
Firstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.
Secondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.
Thirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope…
…The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only.

When the author of the passage above discusses the ""second wall,"" to what is he referring? Choices: a) The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate definition of ""Holy Ghost"" b) The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate use and interpretation of biblical texts c) The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate theological belief about the divinity of Jesus d) The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate method of baptism 
Output:
First, I need to identify the context of the passage. The author, Martin Luther, is discussing the ways in which the Roman Catholic Church has protected itself from reform.
Next, I need to understand what Luther means by the ""second wall."" He describes it as a way in which the Church has protected itself from criticism, specifically by claiming that only the Pope can interpret the Scriptures.
Now, I need to consider the options. Option a) refers to a specific theological issue, but it is not the main point of Luther's discussion. Option c) also refers to a specific theological issue, but it is not relevant to the passage. Option d) is not mentioned in the passage at all. Option b) is the correct answer, as it accurately reflects Luther's discussion of the Church's claim to be the sole interpreters of Scripture.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the letter. The author is writing to his sister about the situation in South Africa during the Anglo-Zulu War.
The author mentions that he has insured his homestead for ￡2,000 and that the insurance companies will not cover the damage caused by the war.
The author also mentions that he is suing the Government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives.
The inclusion of the author's pending litigation with the British government serves to highlight the extent of the author's property losses, as it shows that he is taking action to recover his losses.

Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.

The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.
Heinrich von Füch, ""On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,"" 1744
According to the second passage, which of the following contributed most to the burden faced by native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations? Choices: a) Interference by Russian Orthodox missionaries b) Native inexperience in hunting deep into the subarctic tundra c) Competition from Russian hunters and trappers d) Overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the question. The question is asking about the burden faced by native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations.
Next, I need to identify the key factors that contributed to this burden. The passage mentions several factors, including the lack of horses, the depletion of furbearing animals, and the interference by Russian Orthodox missionaries.
However, the passage specifically states that ""almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors."" This suggests that the lack of horses is a significant factor in the burden faced by native Siberians.

Ban Zhao, Lessons for a Woman, ca. 80 C.E.
In what way were women's lives in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. generally more restricted than women's lives had been globally before the advent of sedentary societies? Choices: a) Women were increasingly thought of as primary earners for the family. b) Women were increasingly responsible for the care of their children. c) Women's power increasingly fell within the private sphere. d) Women's power increasingly fell within the public sphere. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. The passage is from a text called ""Lessons for a Woman"" written by Ban Zhao, a Chinese historian and philosopher, around 80 C.E.
Next, I need to analyze the content of the passage. The passage describes the ideal behavior of a woman, emphasizing her domestic duties, her relationship with her husband, and her role in ancestral worship.
Now, I need to consider the historical context of the passage. The passage was written during the Han Dynasty in ancient China, a time when sedentary societies were becoming more common.
Based on the passage and the historical context, I can infer that women's lives in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. were generally more restricted than women's lives had been globally before the advent of sedentary societies. The passage suggests that women's power and responsibilities were increasingly confined to the private sphere, where they were expected to manage the household and care for their families.

As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures. It behooves you, O King, to display even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity.
According to the passage, what was the Chinese reaction to the British goods? Choices: a) Awe at their technological superiority b) Fascination with their strangeness c) Offense at a perceived bribe d) Interpreting them as an act of submission 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key sentence in the passage that describes the Chinese reaction to the British goods. The sentence is: ""Strange and costly objects do not interest me.""
Next, I need to analyze the meaning of this sentence. The word ""do not interest me"" implies a lack of enthusiasm or value placed on the objects.
Now, I need to consider the context of the sentence. The Chinese emperor is responding to the British envoys' request for expanded trading privileges, and the emperor is essentially saying that the British goods are not valuable or desirable to him.

""To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak––therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty––therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.
That is why we must no longer lag behind.""
Joseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931
The speech as a whole is best understood in the context of which of the following historical developments? Choices: a) Stalin's drive to motivate Soviet industry for the Winter War with Finland b) Stalin's push to make the Soviet Union a nuclear nation c) Stalin's implementation of five-year plans for the Soviet economy d) Stalin's purges of dissidents and other political prisoners 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the speech. The speech is about the importance of not falling behind in development and being beaten by others. It mentions the history of old Russia being beaten by various groups due to her backwardness.
Next, I need to consider the historical developments that could be related to the speech. The speech mentions the importance of development and not falling behind, which could be related to the implementation of five-year plans for the Soviet economy.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) refers to the Winter War with Finland, which is not mentioned in the speech. Option b) refers to the Soviet Union becoming a nuclear nation, which is also not mentioned in the speech. Option c) refers to the implementation of five-year plans, which is consistent with the theme of development and not falling behind. Option d) refers to the purges of dissidents and political prisoners, which is not mentioned in the speech.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

""My little homestead in the city, which I recently insured for ￡2,000 would no doubt have shared the common fate, as the insurance companies will not make good that which is destroyed by the Queen's enemies. And although I have a farm of 50 acres close to the town, no doubt the crops and premises would have been destroyed. In fact, this has already partly been the case, and I am now suing the Government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives that have recently encamped not many hundred yards from the place, who have done much damage all around.""
Letter from a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War, South Africa, 1879
Which of the following reasons explains why European citizens moved in large numbers to Zulu lands in 1867? Choices: a) The British crown offered incentives to those who would establish homesteads in the unsettled lands of South Africa. b) The Zulu created attractive trade ports along the Indian Ocean. c) The Berlin Conference clarified boundaries, thus making it logistically sound for Europeans to move to the African colonies. d) A diamond rush ensued following the discovery of diamonds on Zulu lands. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the historical context of the letter. The letter is written during the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879, which suggests that the European settlement in Zulu lands is a recent phenomenon.
Next, I need to consider the reasons why European citizens would move to Zulu lands. The letter mentions that the writer has a homestead in the city and a farm close to the town, which implies that the area is being settled by Europeans.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) is a plausible reason, as the British crown may have offered incentives to establish homesteads in the unsettled lands of South Africa. Option b) is unlikely, as the Zulu did not have a history of creating attractive trade ports along the Indian Ocean. Option c) is also unlikely, as the Berlin Conference was held in 1884-1885, which is after the events described in the letter. Option d) is unlikely, as the diamond rush in South Africa occurred in the late 19th century, which is after the events described in the letter.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

""The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries. It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.
Non-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments…The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.""
Kwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965
Which of the following most inspired the national plan advanced by Nkrumah in the second paragraph? Choices: a) Fascism b) Social Darwinism c) Classical liberalism d) Socialism 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. Kwame Nkrumah is discussing the concept of neo-colonialism and how it affects less developed countries.
Next, I need to identify the key idea of the national plan. The plan is about co-operating with all states, regardless of their economic systems, but with the goal of preventing the financial power of developed countries from being used to impoverish less developed countries.
Now, I need to consider the options and see which one aligns with the idea of the national plan. 
Fascism (a) is a political ideology that emphasizes nationalism and authoritarianism, but it does not necessarily focus on economic development or cooperation with other states.
Social Darwinism (b) is a concept that applies the principles of natural selection to human societies, but it does not provide a framework for economic development or cooperation.
Classical liberalism (c) emphasizes individual freedom and free markets, but it does not necessarily prioritize economic development or cooperation with other states.
Socialism (d) is an economic system that emphasizes public ownership and collective decision-making, which aligns with the idea of a national plan that prioritizes the interests of the state and its people.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

"Input: This question refers to the following information.
""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.""
Mao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955
Which of the following later developments would most undermine the hopes expressed by Mao in the second-to-last line of the passage? Choices: a) The development of Special Economic Zones along the Chinese coast brought economic growth to China. b) Political friction with the Soviet Union pushed China into the orbit of the United States during the Cold War. c) The cooperatives of peasants on the farmland and an emphasis on countryside steel production brought famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry. d) Opposition voices in the Communist Party led by men such as Deng Xiaopeng were rooted out and silenced during the Cultural Revolution. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. Mao is expressing his hopes for the future of the worker-peasant alliance in China. He believes that the alliance can be consolidated by bringing about the socialist transformation of agriculture, industry, and commerce.
Next, I need to analyze the options and determine which one would most undermine the hopes expressed by Mao. Option a) is a positive development that would likely strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, as it would bring economic growth to China. Option b) is also a positive development, as it would allow China to maintain its independence and sovereignty. Option d) is a negative development, but it is not directly related to the worker-peasant alliance. Option c) is the most relevant option, as it would undermine the hopes expressed by Mao by bringing famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry, which would likely lead to the breakdown of the worker-peasant alliance.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

By what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land!

Lin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839
Which of the following most likely prompted the complaint voiced in the passage? Choices: a) British sale of opium in China b) British exports of tobacco to China c) British introduction of gunpowder to China d) British encouragement of heroin use to China 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main issue that the Chinese trade commissioner, Lin Zexu, is complaining about. The passage mentions ""that poisonous drug"" and ""the injurious drug,"" which suggests that the issue is related to the sale of a harmful substance.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the passage. The letter was written in 1839, and it is well-known that the British were involved in the opium trade in China during this time period.
Finally, I need to evaluate the options and determine which one is most likely to have prompted the complaint. Option a) British sale of opium in China is the most plausible explanation, as it aligns with the historical context and the language used in the passage.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China
In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
According to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry? Choices: a) They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so. b) They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces. c) They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs. d) They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. The passage is discussing the development of gunpowder weaponry in Europe and China during the 1200s through the 1400s.
Next, I need to identify the key difference between the two regions. The passage states that Western Europe was threatened by protracted sieges, which made early cannons useful, while China was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons were of little utility.
Now, I need to analyze the options. Option a) is incorrect because there is no mention of Confucian traditionalism in the passage. Option b) is also incorrect because the passage does not mention the Chinese putting too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces. Option d) is incorrect because the passage does not mention the Chinese being unable to afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology.
The correct answer is option c) because the passage states that China ""logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs"", which implies that they prioritized developing horse archer units over gunpowder weaponry.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

—Adapted from a letter written by Lord Ii to Lord Tokugawa, 1847
How did Japan respond to the concerns raised by Lord Ii during this era? Choices: a) The government dismantled the Chinese-style civil service system. b) The government undertook a program of conquest in the Pacific. c) The country sent emissaries to study western democracies and industry. d) The country turned inward and closed its ports to all foreigners. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the situation. Lord Ii is expressing concerns about Japan's antiquated systems and the potential threat posed by foreign powers, particularly the introduction of steamships and modern war implements.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of Japan during this era. In the mid-19th century, Japan was indeed facing significant external pressures, including the arrival of American Commodore Matthew Perry and his ""Black Ships"" in 1853.
Now, I need to evaluate the options in light of this context. Option a) is incorrect because the Chinese-style civil service system was not dismantled during this era. Option b) is also incorrect because Japan did not undertake a program of conquest in the Pacific during this time. Option c) is plausible, as Japan did send emissaries to study Western democracies and industry, but this was not a direct response to Lord Ii's concerns.

At the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated.... The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions... a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.

Which of the following was a long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s? Choices: a) Russia was excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance). b) Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity. c) Islam became the dominant religion of Russia. d) Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the impact of the Mongol conquest on Russia. The Mongols were a nomadic people who were known for their military prowess and their ability to unite disparate groups under their rule.
Next, I need to think about the long-term consequences of the Mongol conquest. The Mongols brought about a period of relative peace and stability to the region, which allowed for the development of trade and cultural exchange.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices. Choice a) is incorrect because the Mongol conquest actually facilitated Russia's participation in Western European developments. Choice c) is incorrect because the Mongols were not Muslim, and they did not impose Islam on the people they conquered. Choice d) is incorrect because the Mongols did not establish a centralized bureaucracy in Russia.

Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (United States)
The passages are best seen as examples of which prominent social or economic trend from the 1800s? Choices: a) The rise of anti-Semitic ideologies b) Trade protectionism c) A growing desire to attract skilled labor from abroad d) Hardening of anti-immigrant sentiment 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements of the passages. The Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 (Australia) and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (United States) both restrict immigration based on certain criteria.
Next, I need to analyze the criteria for restriction. The Australian Act restricts immigration based on language proficiency, likelihood of becoming a public charge, and type of labor contract. The US Act restricts immigration based on nationality (Chinese laborers) and type of labor (laborers).
Now, I need to consider the broader social and economic trends of the 1800s. The rise of anti-Semitic ideologies (a) is not relevant to the passages, as they do not mention Jews or anti-Semitism. Trade protectionism (b) is also not relevant, as the passages do not discuss tariffs or trade policies. A growing desire to attract skilled labor from abroad (c) is the opposite of what the passages describe, as they restrict immigration rather than encouraging it. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

Which of the following best describes Persia's relationship with Arabia in the period 600–1450 C.E.? Choices: a) Persian armies were largely in control of Arabia throughout the period. b) Persia and Arabia interacted infrequently throughout the period. c) Persia supported Arabian client states throughout the period. d) Persia was brought into the Arabian orbit over the course of the period.

First, I need to identify the time period in question, which is 600–1450 C.E. 
Next, I need to consider the historical context of Persia and Arabia during this time period. 
In the late third century C.E., the inscription of Kerdir at Naqsh-e-Rustam describes the relationship between Persia and various religious groups, including Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, Nasoreans, Christians, Maktak, and Manichaeans, but it does not mention Arabia. 
This suggests that Persia's relationship with Arabia during this time period was likely limited or non-existent.

Which of the following best explains the phenomenon of an African poet writing so lyrically about New York? Choices: a) Outmigration from Africa due to political violence b) Stronger transatlantic influences linking art in Afro-Eurasia with that in the Americas c) Preference on the part of African intellectuals for Western cultural advancements d) Lack of a rich indigenous artistic tradition in Africa 
Output:
First, I need to consider the historical context of the poem. The poem was written in 1956, a time when many African countries were gaining independence from colonial rule.
Next, I need to think about the cultural exchange between Africa and the West during this period. The poem suggests a strong connection between African and Western cultures, with the poet drawing on Western imagery and musical references to describe New York.
Now, I need to consider the options. Option a) is unlikely, as the poem does not suggest that the poet is writing about New York as a result of fleeing political violence. Option c) is also unlikely, as the poem does not suggest that the poet is simply adopting Western cultural values without any connection to African culture. Option d) is also unlikely, as the poem suggests a rich and vibrant cultural tradition in Africa, with the poet drawing on African imagery and symbolism to describe New York.

It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help.... These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.... That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality... That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope... That No One May Call a Council but the Pope.... Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night.... It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called ""cardinals""? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.
—Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation
Which of the following reformers expressed views similar to those expressed by Martin Luther in his letter above? Choices: a) Ulrich Zwingli b) Sir Thomas More c) Erasmus d) John Wycliffe

Luther is criticizing the Roman Catholic Church and its practices, such as the creation of cardinals and the accumulation of wealth by the Church. He is also calling for reform and criticizing the Church's leadership.
Next, I need to consider the views of the other reformers listed. Ulrich Zwingli was a Swiss reformer who also criticized the Catholic Church, but his views were more focused on the sacraments and the authority of the Bible. Sir Thomas More was an English Catholic who was executed for his opposition to the Protestant Reformation, and his views were not similar to Luther's. Erasmus was a Dutch humanist who was critical of the Catholic Church, but he did not call for reform in the same way that Luther did.

When the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names.

Ralph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.
The description in the second paragraph of the procedures that Portuguese and other foreigners followed when trading in China supports which of the following inferences about trade policy in the later Ming Dynasty? Choices: a) The Ming Dynasty was very supportive of and welcoming to all commercial enterprise. b) The Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly to limit contact with foreigners and ease collection of taxes. c) The Ming Dynasty was too busy battling pirates along its coast to pay any attention to regular merchant activity. d) The Ming Dynasty only allowed Portugal to trade with China through Canton, permitting only one boat a year. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the information provided in the text to understand the trade policy in the later Ming Dynasty. The text mentions that when the Portuguese come to Canton in China to trade, they must follow certain procedures, such as entering their names in a book, lying in their boats outside of the town, and not remaining in the town all night. This suggests that the Ming Dynasty had rules and regulations in place for foreign trade.
Next, I need to consider the purpose of these regulations. The text states that if any man remains in the town after their time expired, they are imprisoned. This implies that the Ming Dynasty was trying to control and limit the contact between foreigners and the local population, possibly to ease the collection of taxes or to maintain social order.
Finally, I need to evaluate the options provided. Option a) suggests that the Ming Dynasty was welcoming to all commercial enterprise, but the text suggests the opposite. Option c) mentions battling pirates, but the text does not provide any information about this. Option d) is incorrect because the text does not mention any restrictions on the number of boats allowed to trade. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Which will claim that its material resources and human energies are available for its own national aspirations? We are fast learning that political independence is not enough to rid us of the consequences of colonial rule. We have been too busy nursing our separate states to understand fully the basic need for union, rooted in common purpose, common planning and common endeavour.

First, I need to identify the main idea of the passage. The speaker is talking about the need for African states to work together and be united in order to achieve their goals and contribute to world peace.
Next, I need to consider the options and see which one aligns with the main idea. Nationalism is the idea of promoting the interests of one's own nation, which is not the main idea of the passage. Socialism is an economic system that is not mentioned in the passage. Neocolonialism is the idea of a country being controlled by another country, which is the opposite of what the speaker is advocating for.
The only option that aligns with the main idea of the passage is Pan-Africanism, which is the idea of African states working together and being united in order to achieve their goals and contribute to world peace.

By what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.
Lin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839
On which of the following arguments does the author of the passage principally base his appeal? Choices: a) It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own. b) Confucian teachings forbid the use of all narcotics as inherently immoral. c) Addiction is causing China to suffer an unfavorable balance of trade. d) Britain is unwise to risk the wrath of a militarily more powerful state. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main argument of the author. The author is appealing to Queen Victoria to stop selling opium to China.
Next, I need to analyze the reasons given by the author for this appeal. The author argues that the British are aware of the harm caused by opium, as evidenced by their prohibition of it in their own country.
Finally, I need to determine which of the given choices best matches the author's argument. The author's argument is based on the idea that it is hypocritical for the British to sell a substance that they know is harmful, when they prohibit it in their own country.

Letter from a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War, South Africa, 1879
A historian researching nineteenth-century conflicts in South Africa would most likely find this letter a useful source for information about which of the following? Choices: a) The diffusion of cultural practices throughout South Africa b) Economic boons present in British colonies c) Daily challenges of Afrikaners during the colonial period d) Unforeseen consequences of British imperialism 
Output:
First, I need to identify the context of the letter. The letter is written by a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War in South Africa in 1879.
Next, I need to analyze the content of the letter. The letter mentions the destruction of the writer's homestead and farm by a contingent of 1,500 natives, and the writer is suing the Government for damages.
Now, I need to consider the options. Option a) The diffusion of cultural practices throughout South Africa is not relevant to the letter, as it only mentions the destruction of property. Option b) Economic boons present in British colonies is also not relevant, as the letter does not mention any economic benefits. Option c) Daily challenges of Afrikaners during the colonial period is not relevant, as the letter is written by a British citizen, not an Afrikaner. Option d) Unforeseen consequences of British imperialism is relevant, as the letter mentions the destruction of property by a contingent of natives, which can be seen as a consequence of British imperialism.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

""In Northern India the existence of separate States at this period is usually little more than a question of words. A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.""
W.H. Moreland, India at the Death of Akbar, 1920
Zamindars had an ability ""to establish a claim to sovereignty"" largely due to the Mughal Empire's policy of Choices: a) religious toleration b) universal taxation c) martial law d) suffrage 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the question. The Mughal Empire's policy of martial law is mentioned in the passage, but it is not directly related to the ability of zamindars to establish a claim to sovereignty.
Next, I need to analyze the options given. Religious toleration (a) would not have given zamindars the ability to establish a claim to sovereignty, as it would have allowed them to maintain their current position without challenging the Mughal Empire.
Universal taxation (b) is also not a likely answer, as it would have given the Mughal Empire more control over the zamindars, rather than allowing them to establish a claim to sovereignty.
Suffrage (d) is not mentioned in the passage, and it is not clear how it would have affected the zamindars' ability to establish a claim to sovereignty.
Martial law (c) is the most likely answer, as it would have given the Mughal Empire the power to enforce its rule, making it more difficult for zamindars to establish a claim to sovereignty.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

What does the phrase below tell us about the ruler? Choices: a) He had the Mandate of Heaven. b) He was an absolute monarch. c) He had lost the blessing of the gods. d) He was killed as a result of natural disasters. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. Yi Yin is addressing the young king, instructing him on the virtue of his grandfather, the Meritorious Ancestor.
The passage mentions that the former kings of Xia cultivated their virtue, and as a result, there were no calamities from Heaven. However, their descendant did not follow their example, and Heaven sent down calamities, using their ruler.
This suggests that the ruler of Xia had lost the blessing of the gods, as Heaven sent down calamities as a result of their actions.

Output:
First, I need to identify the key traits of classical empires. The passage describes the decline of the Roman Empire, but it also provides insight into the characteristics of classical empires in general.
Next, I need to analyze each option to determine which one is most consistent with the passage. Option a) They required the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire. This option is not supported by the passage, as it describes the Roman Empire as being overwhelmed by a ""deluge of Barbarians,"" suggesting that the empire did not assimilate the conquered peoples.
Option b) They provided state support of foreign religions to improve support of the government. This option is also not supported by the passage, as it does not mention the Roman Empire providing state support of foreign religions.
Option c) They embarked on widespread public works projects to integrate their empires. This option is consistent with the passage, as it describes the Roman Empire as having a ""stupendous fabric"" that was eventually overwhelmed by its own weight, suggesting that the empire invested heavily in public works projects.
Option d) They had government bureaucracies based on the merit principle. This option is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention the Roman Empire's government bureaucracy.

""The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.
Firstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.
Secondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.
Thirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope…
…The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures?

Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. Martin Luther is addressing the nobility of the German nation, and he is criticizing the Roman Catholic Church.
Next, I need to identify the ""temporal power"" mentioned in the passage. Luther says that the Romanists have drawn three walls around themselves, and the first wall is that they claim the spiritual power is above the temporal power.
Now, I need to determine what the ""temporal power"" refers to. Given the context, it is clear that the ""temporal power"" refers to a state or secular authority, as opposed to a spiritual or ecclesiastical authority.

Output:
First, I need to consider the segments of the population that would benefit most from rising literacy rates. Generally, people in lower socio-economic positions, such as the rural peasantry, would benefit more from increased literacy rates because they would have better access to information and opportunities for social mobility.
Next, I need to consider the segments of the population that would benefit less from rising literacy rates. Members of the Russian Orthodox clergy, the urban middle class, and officers in the armed forces are likely to have higher levels of education and literacy already, so they would benefit less from the rising literacy rates.

A comparison of both verses would best support which of the following conclusions? Choices: a) Many Muslims inclined toward atheism in the premodern era. b) Religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims. c) Christian missionaries were steadily winning converts among Muslim populations. d) Muslim intellectuals were generally hostile to traditional religious practice. 
Output:
First, I need to compare the two verses. The first verse from the Qur'an prohibits the consumption of strong drink and games of chance, which are associated with idolatry. The second verse from the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám, on the other hand, suggests that drinking wine is a joyful and celebratory activity.
Next, I need to consider the context of the two verses. The Qur'anic verse is a prohibition, while the Rubáiyát is a poem that celebrates the beauty of life and the pleasures of drinking wine.
Now, I need to consider the implications of the comparison. The fact that the Rubáiyát, which is a work of a Muslim poet, celebrates the consumption of wine, suggests that not all Muslims observed the religious restrictions on drinking.

How would twentieth-century economist John Maynard Keynes suggest that society address Otto von Bismarck's evaluation of workers in Germany? Choices: a) Keynes would recommend government intervention in order to maintain aggregate demand. b) Keynes would suggest helping elderly workers, but claim that the government should not intervene in most circumstances. c) Keynes would caution against government intervention in personal economic matters. d) Keynes would advocate doing nothing because he felt poverty in rural areas was actually more severe than it was in cities. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the problem. Otto von Bismarck is expressing concerns about the insecurity of workers' existence in Germany, particularly in terms of unemployment, illness, and old age.
Next, I need to consider John Maynard Keynes' economic theories. Keynes believed that government intervention was necessary to stabilize the economy and maintain aggregate demand during times of economic downturn.
Now, I need to analyze how Keynes would address Bismarck's concerns. Keynes would likely recommend government intervention to address the issues of unemployment, illness, and old age. This could include programs such as unemployment insurance, social security, and healthcare.

Output:
First, I need to analyze the two texts to understand their main ideas. The first text describes a place of darkness and despair, where people live in the dark and eat clay. This suggests a negative view of the afterlife. The second text, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of truth and obedience to the gods, and suggests that those who follow these principles will be guided and will not lose themselves.
Next, I need to compare the two texts to the options provided. Option a) suggests that the ancient Egyptians had a less gloomy view of the afterlife than the ancient Sumerians. However, the first text suggests that the Sumerians had a negative view of the afterlife, while the second text does not provide information about the Egyptians' view of the afterlife. Therefore, this option is not supported by the texts.
Option b) suggests that the ancient Egyptians were more inclined to view political obedience as morally proper than the ancient Sumerians. The second text emphasizes the importance of obedience to the gods, which suggests that the Egyptians valued political obedience. In contrast, the first text does not provide information about the Sumerians' view of political obedience. Therefore, this option is supported by the texts.
Option c) suggests that the ancient Egyptians were more patriarchal in their gender relations than the ancient Sumerians. However, neither text provides information about gender relations, so this option is not supported by the texts.
Option d) suggests that the ancient Egyptians suffered under a more rigid social hierarchy than the ancient Sumerians. However, neither text provides information about social hierarchy, so this option is not supported by the texts.

Output:
First, I need to consider the context in which the Epic of Gilgamesh was written. The text mentions the ""glorious sun Shamash"" and ""Adad the terrible god of storms,"" which suggests a strong connection to the gods and the divine.
Next, I need to analyze the content of the text. The Epic of Gilgamesh is a story about a king, Gilgamesh, who is described as ""two thirds god"" and ""one third man."" This suggests that the epic is focused on the deeds of a king or a god-king.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) mentions the rise of a literate class of scribes, which is a plausible explanation for the development of epic poetry. However, it does not directly address the content of the Epic of Gilgamesh. Option b) mentions the rise of a merchant class, which is not directly related to the content of the epic. Option c) mentions the rise of a religious caste, which is also not directly related to the content of the epic. Option d) mentions the rise of a warrior elite, which is not directly related to the content of the epic.

While both empires experienced periods of decline, the reasons given in the passage do not seem to apply directly to their falls.
Option b) Ming and Aztec: The Ming Dynasty was a Chinese empire that flourished from the 14th to the 17th century, while the Aztec Empire was a Mesoamerican empire that flourished from the 14th to the 16th century. The passage does not seem to apply directly to the falls of these empires.
Option c) Han and Gupta: The Han Dynasty was a Chinese empire that flourished from the 2nd century BCE to the 3rd century CE, while the Gupta Empire was an Indian empire that flourished from the 4th to the 6th century CE. The passage mentions that the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest, which could be applied to the Han Dynasty's expansion and the Gupta Empire's extensive trade networks. Additionally, the passage mentions that the victorious legions acquired vices and corrupted the discipline, which could be applied to the Han Dynasty's military expansion and the Gupta Empire's reliance on mercenaries.
Option d) Qin and Etruscan: The Qin Dynasty was a Chinese empire that flourished from the 3rd to the 2nd century BCE, while the Etruscan civilization was an ancient civilization that flourished in what is now modern-day Italy from the 8th to the 1st century BCE. The passage does not seem to apply directly to the falls of these empires.
Based on the analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
Woman, wake up; the bell of reason is being heard throughout the whole universe; discover your rights. Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!
Olympe de Gouges, ""Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,"" 1791
The independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fear—but apart from that, nothing has changed.
Halima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence
Which of the following factors is likeliest to have prevented the sort of progress hoped for by the speaker in the second passage? Choices: a) Failure to eradicate Islamic traditionalism b) Lack of industrial assets or infrastructure c) Hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites d) Prioritization of national liberation over social reform 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context of the passage. The speaker is an Algerian woman who lived through the country's war of independence. She expresses disappointment that the independence did not bring about the changes she had hoped for, particularly in terms of education for her children.
Next, I need to analyze the factors that might have prevented the progress she hoped for. Option a) Failure to eradicate Islamic traditionalism might have contributed to the lack of progress, but it is not the most direct factor. Option b) Lack of industrial assets or infrastructure might have hindered economic development, but it is not directly related to the speaker's concerns about education and women's rights.
Option c) Hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites is a plausible factor, as it would have prevented the implementation of policies that promote women's education and empowerment. Option d) Prioritization of national liberation over social reform might have led to a focus on independence at the expense of addressing social issues like education and women's rights.

""And then Shapur, King of Kings, passed away. Then his son Hormizd, King of Kings, rose over the empire. And Hormizd, King of Kings, conferred on me cap and belt and created for me a higher rank and dignity, and at court and in kingdom after kingdom, place after place, throughout the whole empire he gave me more authority and power in matters of the divine services, and created for me the title ""Kerdir, Ahura Mazda's [Chief Priest]"" after the name of Ahura Mazda, the Deity.

Excerpt from the inscription of Kerdir at Naqsh-e-Rustam, Persia, late third century C.E.
The source best supports which of the following inferences about sources of political authority in the period circa 600 B.C.E.–600 C.E.? Choices: a) Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule by their sponsorship of religion and chief priests. b) Rulers were limited in their political authority by powerful religious figures. c) Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule through victories over foreign peoples. d) Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule through the consent of those they governed. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key points in the text that relate to the question. The text describes the relationship between the rulers of the empire and the chief priest, Kerdir. It states that the rulers, Hormizd and Bahram, conferred on Kerdir a higher rank and dignity, and gave him more authority and power in matters of the divine services. It also states that the rulers held Kerdir in high honor and dignity, and that Kerdir was given authority and power for divine services of every sort.
Next, I need to analyze the relationship between the rulers and Kerdir. The text suggests that the rulers derived their legitimacy for their rule by their sponsorship of religion and chief priests, as they conferred on Kerdir a higher rank and dignity, and gave him more authority and power in matters of the divine services.
Finally, I need to evaluate the answer choices based on the analysis. Choice a) Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule by their sponsorship of religion and chief priests, is supported by the text. Choice b) Rulers were limited in their political authority by powerful religious figures, is not supported by the text, as it suggests that the rulers had significant control over the chief priest. Choice c) Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule through victories over foreign peoples, is not mentioned in the text. Choice d) Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule through the consent of those they governed, is not mentioned in the text.

""Al-Zawawi also said 'This sultan Musa told me that at a town called ZKRY he has a copper mine from which ingots are brought to BYTY. ""There is nothing in my kingdom, Musa said, on which a duty is levied except this crude copper which is brought in. Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.""

Ralph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.
The description of the route Portuguese sailors took in the first paragraph most directly supports which of the following historical developments? Choices: a) Chinese merchants' domination of East Asian trade b) Competition between Dutch and Portuguese traders for markets in Japan c) European participation in East Asian trade patterns d) Jesuit missionary work in Japan and China 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements of the route described by the Portuguese sailors. The route involves traveling from Macao in China to Japan, carrying goods such as white silk, gold, musk, and porcelain, and bringing back silver.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the time period mentioned in the text, which is 1599 C.E. During this time, European powers such as Portugal were expanding their trade and colonial empires in Asia.
Now, I need to evaluate the options in light of the information provided. Option a) Chinese merchants' domination of East Asian trade is not supported by the text, as the Portuguese are the ones described as carrying goods and bringing back silver. Option b) Competition between Dutch and Portuguese traders for markets in Japan is not mentioned in the text, and the Dutch are not even mentioned. Option c) European participation in East Asian trade patterns is directly supported by the text, as the Portuguese are described as traveling from Macao in China to Japan and engaging in trade. Option d) Jesuit missionary work in Japan and China is not mentioned in the text, and while the Jesuits were active in Asia during this time period, the text does not provide any information about their activities.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road.

Mao's quotation is best understood in the context of which of the following? Choices: a) Governments in communist countries implementing liberal political and economic reforms to mitigate social unrest b) Governments promoting collectivization of the land to reduce inequality between sectors of the population c) Governments promoting policies intended to hasten industrialization d) Governments promoting capitalist policies to reduce inequality between sectors of the population 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of Mao's quotation. The quotation mentions the polarization in the countryside, the growth of rich peasants, and the need for socialist transformation of agriculture. It also mentions the worker-peasant alliance and the need to bring about co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy.
Next, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) refers to liberal political and economic reforms, which is not relevant to the context of Mao's quotation. Option d) refers to capitalist policies, which is also not relevant to the context of Mao's quotation.
Option b) refers to collectivization of the land, which is relevant to the context of Mao's quotation. The quotation mentions the need to bring about co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy, which is consistent with collectivization of the land.
Option c) refers to policies intended to hasten industrialization, which is not directly relevant to the context of Mao's quotation. However, the quotation does mention the need to realize socialist industrialization, which suggests that industrialization is related to the context of the quotation.

As for their men there is no sexual jealousy in them. And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons.... They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.

What evidence is there in the passage that the Malians take their Muslim faith seriously? Choices: a) The genealogy is derived from the maternal side. b) They study Islamic law faithfully. c) The men do not yield to sexual jealousy. d) They enjoy friendship with all, regardless of gender. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements that indicate the Malians take their Muslim faith seriously. The passage mentions that the men are ""Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart."" This suggests that they are committed to their faith and actively engage in religious practices.
Next, I need to consider the other options and determine if they provide evidence of the Malians' commitment to their faith. Option a) mentions the genealogy being derived from the maternal side, but this is a cultural practice and not necessarily a religious one. Option c) mentions that the men do not yield to sexual jealousy, but this is a cultural practice and not necessarily a religious one. Option d) mentions that they enjoy friendship with all, regardless of gender, but this is a cultural practice and not necessarily a religious one.

Mao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955
Mao's view of the cooperation of peasant labor most directly reflects the influence of which of the following? Choices: a) The ideals of communism as stated by Joseph Stalin b) The ideals of the Enlightenment as stated by political revolutionaries such as Maximilian Robespierre c) The ideals of classical liberalism as stated by Adam Smith d) The ideals of globalization as evidenced by multinational trade blocs such as NAFTA or the European Union 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. Mao Zedong is discussing the issue of peasant labor and the need for cooperation in the countryside.
Next, I need to identify the key elements of Mao's view on cooperation. Mao emphasizes the need for socialist transformation of agriculture and the elimination of the rich-peasant economy and individual economy in the countryside.
Now, I need to consider the possible influences on Mao's view. The ideals of communism as stated by Joseph Stalin emphasize the collective ownership of the means of production and the elimination of private property, which aligns with Mao's emphasis on socialist transformation and the elimination of individual economies.
The ideals of the Enlightenment as stated by Maximilian Robespierre emphasize the importance of individual rights and liberties, which does not align with Mao's emphasis on collective ownership and the elimination of individual economies.
The ideals of classical liberalism as stated by Adam Smith emphasize the importance of individual freedom and the free market, which does not align with Mao's emphasis on socialist transformation and the elimination of individual economies.
The ideals of globalization as evidenced by multinational trade blocs such as NAFTA or the European Union emphasize the importance of international trade and cooperation, but do not necessarily emphasize the elimination of individual economies or the collective ownership of the means of production.

""After the Tencteri came, in former days, the Bructeri; but the general account now is, that the Chamavi and Angrivarii entered their settlements, drove them out and utterly exterminated them with the common help of the [neighboring] tribes, either from hatred of their tyranny, or from the attractions of plunder, or from heaven's [favorable] regard for us. It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.""
Germania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.
The views expressed in the excerpt are best seen as evidence of which of the following in Roman society? Choices: a) Disgust for barbarian peoples b) Concern about barbarian attacks c) Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy d) Maintenance of large armies 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the tone of the passage to understand the views expressed by the author. The author describes the conflict between the Tencteri and the Chamavi and Angrivarii as a spectacle, and expresses delight at the sight of the Bructeri being exterminated.
Next, I need to consider the language used by the author to describe the conflict. The author uses words such as ""tyranny"" and ""plunder"" to describe the Bructeri, which suggests a negative view of the Bructeri and a positive view of the Roman Empire.
Finally, I need to consider the implications of the author's views. The author's delight at the sight of the Bructeri being exterminated suggests that the Roman Empire is willing to use violence to maintain its power and dominance over other tribes.

I have, in conformity without resolve, put together some few points concerning the reformation of the Christian estate, with the intent of placing the same before the Christian nobility of the German nation.... It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help.... These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.... That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality... That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope... That No One May Call a Council but the Pope.... Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night.... It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called ""cardinals""? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.
—Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation
In his letter, Martin Luther avoided speaking about which of the following topics? Choices: a) The wealth of the church b) The power of the clergy c) The sale of indulgences d) The political nature of the church 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main topics discussed in the letter. Martin Luther talks about the distress and misery of the Christian estates, the three walls that the Romanists have drawn around themselves, and the need for reform. He also criticizes the wealth and power of the clergy, and the way that the church is run.
Next, I need to consider the options and determine which topic is not discussed in the letter. The letter does mention the wealth of the church, as Luther criticizes the rich convents and the way that the church is run for personal gain. It also mentions the power of the clergy, as Luther talks about the way that the clergy have used their power to accumulate wealth and influence. The sale of indulgences is not mentioned in the letter, but Luther does talk about the way that the church is run for personal gain, which is related to the sale of indulgences.

""MAHATMA GANDHI'S MESSAGE.
REMAIN NON-VIOLENT
The following message was sent by Mahatma Gandhi from Waltair:—
Maulana Mohamed AH was arrested at Waltair under sections 107 and 108 to be called upon to give security, to be of good behaviour for one year. The place and date of trial is unknown.
The Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.
He and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.
I hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.

Choices: a) The Zionist movement that created the modern state of Israel b) The independence movements that freed the states of southeast Asia from colonial rule c) The civil rights movements that changed the legal status of minorities in the United States d) The communist movement that changed the government of Cuba 
Output:
First, I need to identify the context of the message. The message is from Mahatma Gandhi, who was a key figure in the Indian independence movement.
Next, I need to understand the content of the message. Gandhi is urging his followers to remain non-violent in the face of the arrest of Maulana Mohamed Ali, a prominent Muslim leader.
Now, I need to consider the historical developments that were influenced by Gandhi's message. The message is urging non-violence and civil disobedience, which were key tactics used by Gandhi and the Indian independence movement.
Considering the options, I can see that the civil rights movements in the United States were also influenced by the principles of non-violence and civil disobedience. The message is likely to have inspired the civil rights movements that changed the legal status of minorities in the United States.

Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (United States)
Which of the following economic activities did the most to drive the rising levels of immigration that led to the enactment of the law described in the second passage? Choices: a) Railroad construction b) Fertilizer harvesting c) Sugarcane production d) Gold mining 
Output:
First, I need to identify the time period in which the law was enacted. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was enacted in the late 19th century, a time of rapid economic growth and industrialization in the United States.
Next, I need to consider the economic activities that were prevalent during this time period. Railroad construction, fertilizer harvesting, sugarcane production, and gold mining were all significant economic activities during this time.
However, the most significant economic activity that drove the rising levels of immigration during this time was the construction of railroads. The construction of the transcontinental railroad, which was completed in 1869, created a huge demand for labor, and many immigrants came to the United States to work on the railroad.

""The quicksilver mines of Huancavelica are where the poor Indians are so harshly punished, where they are tortured and so many Indians die; it is there that the noble caciques [headmen] of this kingdom are finished off and tortured. The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]….The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year….
And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.
And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines….And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]…at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays.

The passage suggests that the king is not aware of the problems faced by the Indians, and that the colonial officials are more interested in protecting the interests of the mine owners than in protecting the welfare of the Indians.

Which of the following conclusions about the period 600 C.E.–1450 C.E. is most directly supported by the passage? Choices: a) Long-distance contact between civilizations stagnated. b) New religious traditions overturned prior lasting religious beliefs. c) The empires of steppe nomads united trade links across Eurasia. d) Technological developments spread across trade routes. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key information in the passage. The passage describes the presence of Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Turks in the city of Hangzhou, China, and mentions the existence of mosques, colleges, and other Islamic institutions.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the passage. The passage is from the 14th century, and it describes a time when trade and cultural exchange were flourishing across Eurasia.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices in light of the key information and historical context. Choice a) is incorrect because the passage suggests that long-distance contact between civilizations was active and vibrant during this period. Choice b) is also incorrect because the passage does not suggest that new religious traditions overturned prior lasting religious beliefs. Instead, it suggests that Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Turks coexisted in the city of Hangzhou. Choice d) is incorrect because the passage does not mention technological developments.
Choice c) is the most directly supported by the passage. The passage describes the presence of steppe nomads, such as the Tartars, in China, and mentions the existence of trade links across Eurasia. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.
Antonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potosí, 1620s
The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.
Heinrich von Füch, ""On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,"" 1744
Both passages are best seen in the context of which of the following broad developments? Choices: a) Emerging systems of coerced labor b) The expansion of chattel slavery c) Increased reliance on prison-camp workforces d) Colonization of overseas territories by joint-stock companies 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passages. Both passages describe the exploitation of indigenous peoples in the New World and Siberia. The first passage describes the mita system, where Indians are forced to work in mercury mines, and the second passage describes the yasak tribute system, where natives are forced to pay tribute in the form of furs or cash.
Next, I need to identify the common theme in both passages. Both passages describe systems of forced labor or tribute, where indigenous peoples are exploited by colonial powers.
Now, I need to consider the options. Option a) Emerging systems of coerced labor is the most relevant to the passages. The mita system and the yasak tribute system are both examples of coerced labor, where indigenous peoples are forced to work or pay tribute against their will.
Option b) The expansion of chattel slavery is not directly relevant to the passages. While chattel slavery is a form of coerced labor, it is not the specific type of labor described in the passages.
Option c) Increased reliance on prison-camp workforces is not relevant to the passages. The passages do not describe the use of prison camps or forced labor in a modern industrial context.
Option d) Colonization of overseas territories by joint-stock companies is not directly relevant to the passages. While the passages do describe colonialism, they do not specifically mention joint-stock companies.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.
As we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women's liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation. In order to build this alliance, the brothers in gay liberation will have to be prepared to sacrifice that degree of male chauvinism and male privilege that they still all possess.""

According to the text, the authors of Source 3 see which of the following as an obstacle to achieving Gay Liberation? Choices: a) Rigid societal gender roles b) Conflicts with the women's rights movement c) Societal privileging of some races over others d) Inequity in pay scales 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main goal of the Gay Liberation Front, which is to ""rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression.""
Next, I need to understand what the authors see as the obstacle to achieving this goal. According to the text, the obstacle is the ""social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles.""
Now, I need to compare this with the options provided. The correct answer is the one that matches the obstacle identified in the text. The authors of Source 3 see rigid societal gender roles as the obstacle to achieving Gay Liberation.

At the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated.... The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions... a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.

Which statement most accurately compares the Mongol (post-classical) empire with the Persian (classical) empire? Choices: a) Both the Mongols and the Persians allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures. b) The Mongols invested in building large-scale monuments, whereas the Persians focused on public works. c) Both the Persians and the Mongols improved the social, economic, and legal status of women. d) The Mongols created a new syncretic belief system, but the Persians maintained a traditional monotheistic religion. 
Output:
First, I need to compare the Mongol and Persian empires based on the information provided. The text states that the Mongols allowed conquered peoples to live together in peace and tolerated all religions, which suggests that they allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures.
Next, I need to compare the Mongols and Persians in terms of their investment in building large-scale monuments. The text does not mention the Mongols building large-scale monuments, but it does mention that the Mongols created a well-policed domain that facilitated international contact and trade.
Finally, I need to compare the Mongols and Persians in terms of their impact on the social, economic, and legal status of women. The text does not provide any information about the Mongols' impact on women's status, but it does mention that the Mongols created a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated.

Which of the following would best support the author's assertion regarding the ""quantum jump"" that would help Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.? Choices: a) The colonization of the interior of Africa b) The conquest of the Aztec Empire c) The reformation of Catholic Christianity d) The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan 
Output:
First, I need to understand what the author means by a ""quantum jump"" in productivity. The author suggests that Western Europe needed to increase its productivity significantly in order to achieve global hegemony.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of Western Europe between 1450 and 1750 C.E. During this time, Western Europe was expanding its empires and establishing trade routes with other regions of the world.
Now, I need to evaluate the options to see which one would best support the author's assertion. Option a) The colonization of the interior of Africa would not have been a significant factor in Western Europe's productivity, as it was not a major source of resources or trade during this time period. Option b) The conquest of the Aztec Empire would have provided Western Europe with access to new resources and trade routes, which would have increased its productivity. Option c) The reformation of Catholic Christianity would not have had a direct impact on Western Europe's productivity, as it was a religious movement rather than an economic one. Option d) The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan would not have supported Western Europe's productivity, as it would have limited trade and resource exchange between the two regions.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Choices: a) Educational reform in the modern era b) Centralized and state-directed campaigns of modernization c) Experimentation with syndicalist forms of socio-economic organization d) Second-stage industrialization in the non-Western world 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the information presented in the chart. The chart shows the literacy rates among the Russian-speaking population of late Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union from 1897 to 1955.
Next, I need to consider the historical context in which the Soviet Union was formed and developed. The Soviet Union was formed in 1922 and was a socialist state that aimed to modernize and industrialize the country.
Now, I need to analyze the information presented in the chart in relation to the historical context. The chart shows a significant increase in literacy rates during the Soviet period, from 24% in 1897 to 99.90% in 1955. This suggests that the Soviet government implemented policies and programs to improve education and literacy, which is consistent with the goal of modernization.

Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.
William Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, ""On the Suppression of Sati,"" 1829
I have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].

The authors of both passages served institutions associated with which of the following colonial techniques commonly used by Western imperial powers? Choices: a) Direct rule by the crown b) Complete privatization of colonial authority c) Martial law enforced by sizable armies d) The chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits 
Output:
First, I need to identify the institutions associated with the authors of the passages. William Bentinck was the Governor-General of India, which suggests that he was associated with the British government or crown. George Simpson was the Head of the Northern Department of the Hudson's Bay Company, which was a chartered company.
Next, I need to consider the colonial techniques commonly used by Western imperial powers. Direct rule by the crown refers to the practice of the crown directly governing a colony, which is not the case in the passages. Complete privatization of colonial authority refers to the practice of private companies or individuals governing a colony without any government oversight, which is also not the case in the passages. Martial law enforced by sizable armies refers to the practice of using military force to govern a colony, which is not mentioned in the passages.
Finally, I need to consider the chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits, which is the practice of granting a charter to a private company to govern a colony and share the profits with the government. This is the technique used by the Hudson's Bay Company, as mentioned in the passage.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

""Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
""But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.""

Choices: a) Confucian relationships between husband and wife were still strong in Tang society. b) Imperial rescripts emphasized the birth of able sons over daughters to fulfill conscription quotas. c) Agricultural work could be shared by women and men alike. d) Traditional Chinese gender relations were reversed during the reign of Empress Wu Zetian. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the poem to understand the context and the message it conveys. The poem describes the hardships faced by soldiers and the difficulties of rural life in Tang society.
Next, I need to identify the specific information related to gender relations in the poem. The poem mentions that it's harder for Shanxi men to have sons because they are often impressed into military service, and that it's better to have a daughter who can marry and live with the neighbors.
Now, I need to evaluate the options based on the information in the poem. Option a) is incorrect because the poem does not mention the strength of Confucian relationships between husband and wife. Option c) is also incorrect because the poem suggests that men are often away fighting, and that women are left to handle the household chores. Option d) is incorrect because the poem does not mention Empress Wu Zetian or her reign.

Output:
First, I need to analyze the Mongol administration in China during the period 600 C.E. to 1450 C.E. as described in the excerpt. The excerpt states that the Mongols in China were tolerant of many religious traditions, including Islam, and that they had a strong presence in the country, with many Muslims residing in the city of Hangzhou.
Next, I need to compare this with the Mongol administration of its Russian domains during the same period. The Mongols in Russia were known to be more brutal and oppressive, and they relied heavily on tribute from the Russian principalities.
Now, I need to evaluate the options based on this comparison. Option a) is incorrect because the Mongols in China were not only tolerant of Orthodox Christianity, but also of many other religious traditions. Option b) is correct because the Mongols in Russia relied heavily on tribute from the Russian principalities, while the Mongols in China emulated a centralized Chinese bureaucratic state.

Which of the following developments from the period 1750–1900 C.E. most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph? Choices: a) The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants b) Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas c) The Industrial Revolution d) The colonization of Africa 
Output:
First, I need to understand the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph. The Portuguese are carrying goods such as white silk, gold, musk, and porcelain from China to Japan, and bringing back silver. They are also using the silver from Japan and India to their advantage in China, and bringing back gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and other costly items from China.
Next, I need to consider the developments from the period 1750–1900 C.E. that could have undid these trade patterns. Option a) The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants could have potentially disrupted the trade patterns, but it is not the most direct cause.
Option b) Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas could have led to changes in trade policies and practices, but it is not the most direct cause.
Option c) The Industrial Revolution could have led to the mass production of goods that were previously imported from China, making it less necessary for the Portuguese to trade with China.
Option d) The colonization of Africa is not directly related to the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (United States)
The emphasis on language in the first passage is most safely interpreted as Choices: a) a concern for high educational standards in a rapidly growing society. b) a tactic allowing the exclusion of non-Europeans without referring directly to race. c) a measure to ensure that all immigrants possessed useful expertise. d) an attempt to bar all immigrants regardless of origin. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context of the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901. The Act is concerned with restricting immigration to Australia, and it lists various categories of people who are prohibited from entering the country.
Next, I need to examine the specific provision that mentions language. Paragraph (a) states that any person who fails to write out at dictation and sign a passage of 50 words in length in a European language is considered a prohibited immigrant.
Now, I need to consider the possible interpretations of the language provision. Option a) suggests that the provision is related to high educational standards, but this does not seem to be the primary concern of the Act. Option c) implies that the provision is related to the expertise of immigrants, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the Act. Option d) suggests that the provision is an attempt to bar all immigrants regardless of origin, but this is not the case, as the Act specifically targets certain categories of people.
Therefore, the most plausible interpretation is that the language provision is a tactic allowing the exclusion of non-Europeans without referring directly to race. This is consistent with the historical context of the Act, which was enacted during a period of rising nationalism and racism in Australia.

Which of the following best describes the most common political significance of conflict between states to the rulers of early civilizations? Choices: a) Victories against outsiders granted legitimacy to leaders of states. b) Victories against outsiders provided slaves whose labor sustained agricultural systems. c) Victories against outsiders demonstrated the power of divinities over other gods. d) Victories against outsiders allowed leaders of states to incorporate the elites of the subjugated into the conquering power. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the context of the poem. The poem describes the ruler of Syria and his military campaigns, highlighting his victories and the impact they had on the people and the land.
Next, I need to consider the political significance of conflict between states in early civilizations. The poem suggests that victories against outsiders granted legitimacy to leaders of states, as the ruler of Syria is praised for his military prowess and his ability to overcome other lands.
Now, I need to evaluate the other options. While victories against outsiders may have provided slaves or demonstrated the power of divinities, these are not the primary political significance of conflict between states in early civilizations.

They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.""
Ralph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.
Which of the following developments from the period 1450–1750 C.E. most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph? Choices: a) The eastward expansion of Russia b) The Portuguese conquest of India c) The establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate d) The Spanish conquest of Mexico 
Output:
First, I need to identify the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph. The Portuguese are carrying goods from China to Japan and bringing goods from Japan to China, and they are also using silver from Japan and India to their advantage in China.
Next, I need to consider the developments from the period 1450–1750 C.E. that could have disrupted these trade patterns. The Portuguese conquest of India (b) could have disrupted the trade patterns by giving the Portuguese a monopoly on the spice trade and allowing them to control the flow of goods between China and Japan. The establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate (c) could have also disrupted the trade patterns by closing Japan to European trade and commerce. The eastward expansion of Russia (a) and the Spanish conquest of Mexico (d) are less likely to have directly affected the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

""Purusa-Sukta""
Purusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.
It was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.
When they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.

Which of the following statements is supported by the information in the passage above? Choices: a) The caste system was a purely social construct that reflected its time period. b) The caste system was encouraged by regional princes to reinforce social stability. c) The caste system reinforced Indian identity in the face of Muslim invaders. d) The caste system was integral to the Hindu religion, transcending historical eras. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. The passage refers to the Purusa-Sukta, an ancient Hindu text that describes the creation of the world and the origin of the four varnas (social classes) in Hindu society.
Next, I need to identify the key information in the passage. The passage states that the four varnas were created from the body of Purusa, the lord of the immortals. The mouth of Purusa became the Brahman, the arms became the Ksatriya, the thighs became the Vaisya, and the feet became the Sudra.
Now, I need to analyze the options. Option a) suggests that the caste system was a social construct, but the passage implies that it was a divine creation. Option b) is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention regional princes. Option c) is also not supported, as the passage does not mention Muslim invaders. Option d) suggests that the caste system was integral to the Hindu religion, which is supported by the passage.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

North Atlantic Treaty, April 4, 1949
The North Atlantic Treaty in the passage above most clearly supports which of the following concepts? Choices: a) Capitalism b) Collective defense c) Mutually assured destruction d) Communism 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of the North Atlantic Treaty. The treaty is focused on promoting peace and security in the North Atlantic area.
Next, I need to analyze the specific articles of the treaty to understand its main concept. Article 1 emphasizes the importance of peaceful means to settle international disputes, while Article 2 promotes friendly international relations and economic collaboration.
However, Article 5 is the most relevant to the question, as it clearly states that an armed attack against one or more of the parties will be considered an attack against all, and that each party will assist the attacked party by taking necessary action, including the use of armed force.

Questions to the passage below, an account given to a French officer in Algeria in the 1830s by a member of an Arab slave trade caravan.
The Slave Trade
All of you [soldiers], are summoned... to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""].... The soldiery divided themselves into two companies... with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields.... Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries
A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women.... It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own.... Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk.... They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.
Which statement best supports the argument that religion played a role in the Arab slave trade? Choices: a) Seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields b) With orders to attack places without defenses c) Four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women d) All of you soldiers, are summoned... to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes 
Output:
First, I need to identify the statement that mentions religion. The passage mentions that the Koholanes are referred to as ""idolatrous,"" which implies that they have a different religion than the Arabs.
Next, I need to determine how this statement supports the argument that religion played a role in the Arab slave trade. The fact that the Koholanes are referred to as ""idolatrous"" suggests that their religion was a reason for the Arabs to hunt and enslave them.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

""The greatest contribution that Africa can make to the peace of the world is to avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity, by creating a political union which will also by its success, stand as an example to a divided world. A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.""
Kwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961
The passage is most clearly an example of which of the following? Choices: a) Responses to failed unification attempts in Africa b) A plea for the United Nations to intervene in Africa c) A proposal to increase the standing of Africa in the modern world d) Ardent opposition to the influence of capitalism in Africa 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of the passage. The passage is talking about the importance of African unity and how it can benefit the continent and the world.
Next, I need to analyze the language and tone used in the passage. The language is formal and persuasive, and the tone is optimistic and confident.
Now, I need to consider the options and determine which one best fits the main idea and tone of the passage. Option c) A proposal to increase the standing of Africa in the modern world is the most fitting, as the passage argues that a united Africa will be more effective in projecting the African personality and commanding respect from the world.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.
William Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, ""On the Suppression of Sati,"" 1829
I have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].
George Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826
The first passage can be said to undermine which commonly held assumption about Western imperialism? Choices: a) That European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices b) That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits c) That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations d) That European colonizers often resorted to armed force to impose their will on imperial subjects 
Output:
First, I need to identify the commonly held assumption about Western imperialism that the first passage is likely to undermine. The passage discusses the decision to continue or discontinue the practice of sati, which is a native religious practice. It suggests that the decision is surrounded by a difficult responsibility, implying that the British are considering the impact of their actions on the native population.
Next, I need to consider the tone and language used in the passage. The passage is written in a formal and serious tone, and it emphasizes the importance of considering the welfare of the native population. This suggests that the British are not simply imposing their will on the native population, but are rather trying to make a difficult decision that balances competing interests.
Finally, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) suggests that the passage undermines the assumption that European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices. However, the passage does not suggest that the British are interfering with the practice of sati for the first time, but rather that they are considering whether to continue or discontinue it. Option b) suggests that the passage undermines the assumption that European colonizers were not concerned with turning profits. However, the passage does not mention profits at all, and instead focuses on the moral and ethical implications of the decision. Option c) suggests that the passage undermines the assumption that European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations. This option seems most plausible, as the passage suggests that the British are considering the impact of their actions on the native population and are trying to make a difficult decision that balances competing interests. Option d) suggests that the passage undermines the assumption that European colonizers often resorted to armed force to impose their will on imperial subjects. However, the passage does not mention armed force at all, and instead focuses on the moral and ethical implications of the decision.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

Know the self to be sitting in the chariot, the body to be the chariot, the intellect the charioteer, and the mind the reins. He who has understanding, who is mindful and always pure, indeed reaches that place from whence he is not born again.
from the Upanishads, India, circa 600s–400s B.C.E.
Compared to the message communicated by the excerpt, Buddhist doctrine regarding reincarnation most resembled Hinduism in that it Choices: a) retained the concept of karma. b) proposed a heavenly existence after death. c) rejected the validity of all gods. d) mandated unquestioning obedience to the priestly class. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the main idea of the excerpt, which is the concept of the self and the path to liberation. The excerpt describes the self as the charioteer, the body as the chariot, the intellect as the charioteer, and the mind as the reins. This metaphor suggests that the self is in control of its own destiny and that it can reach a state of liberation through mindfulness and self-purification.
Next, I need to compare this idea with the Buddhist doctrine regarding reincarnation. Buddhist doctrine teaches that the self is an illusion and that the cycle of birth and death is driven by karma. However, Buddhist doctrine does not retain the concept of a permanent self or a heavenly existence after death.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices. Choice a) retained the concept of karma, which is a key aspect of Buddhist doctrine. Choice b) proposed a heavenly existence after death, which is not a central tenet of Buddhist doctrine. Choice c) rejected the validity of all gods, which is a key aspect of Buddhist doctrine. Choice d) mandated unquestioning obedience to the priestly class, which is not a central tenet of Buddhist doctrine.

""To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak––therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty––therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.

Joseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931
Stalin's speech is most strongly influenced by which of the following? Choices: a) Appeasement b) Fascism c) Communism d) Secret treaties 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of Stalin's speech. The speech is about the importance of not falling behind in development and progress, and how this can lead to being beaten or exploited by others.
Next, I need to analyze the language and tone used in the speech. Stalin uses phrases such as ""beat her"" and ""exploiters"" to describe the actions of those who are stronger or more developed, and emphasizes the need for Russia to be strong and self-sufficient.
Now, I need to consider the historical and political context of the speech. Stalin's speech was delivered in 1931, during a time of great industrialization and modernization in the Soviet Union. The speech reflects the communist ideology of the time, which emphasized the importance of collective ownership and the elimination of social classes.
Based on this analysis, I would conclude that Stalin's speech is most strongly influenced by communism. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

She seeks therefore and desires to be liberated and does not cease to implore you to come to her aid. From you especially she asks succor, because, as we have already said, God has conferred upon you above all nations great glory in arms. Accordingly undertake this journey for the remission of your sins, with the assurance of the imperishable glory of the kingdom of heaven.""
Pope Urban II, Speech at the Council of Clermont as recorded by Robert the Monk, 1095 C.E.
Which of the following events was most directly the result of the speech presented above? Choices: a) The failure of any Christian campaign to reclaim the Levant b) The decline of Mediterranean trade routes c) The conquest of Constantinople by Latin Christians d) The decisive defeat of the Seljuk Turks by Byzantine forces 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main purpose of the speech. The speech is a call to arms, urging the audience to go on a military campaign to reclaim the Holy Land from the infidels.
Next, I need to identify the immediate consequences of the speech. The speech was delivered at the Council of Clermont in 1095 C.E., and it is widely believed to have inspired the First Crusade, a military campaign that took place from 1096 to 1099 C.E.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) is incorrect because the speech was a call to action, not a prediction of failure. Option b) is also incorrect because the speech did not mention trade routes. Option c) is the correct answer because the conquest of Constantinople by Latin Christians was a key event of the Fourth Crusade, which was a direct result of the speech. Option d) is incorrect because the decisive defeat of the Seljuk Turks by Byzantine forces was not a direct result of the speech.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

But their descendant did not follow their example, and Heaven sent down calamities, using our ruler, who possessed of its favor. The attack on Xia may be traced to the orgies in Ming Tiao.... Our king of Shang brilliantly displayed his sagely prowess; for oppression he substituted his generous gentleness. Now your Majesty is entering on the inheritance of his virtue; all depends on how you commence your reign.

Next, I need to identify the phrase that can be seen as a statement of the roots of Daoist beliefs. Daoism emphasizes the importance of living in harmony with nature and the natural order of things.
The phrase ""The birds and beasts... enjoyed their existence according to their nature"" (option c) suggests that living in harmony with nature is a key aspect of Daoist beliefs. This phrase implies that animals live in accordance with their natural instincts and that humans should strive to do the same.

Which style of government is most associated with limited regulations on business and working conditions similar to those described in the passage? Choices: a) Laissez-faire b) Totalitarian c) Utilitarian d) Corporatist 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. The passage describes a situation where workers, including children, are working in factories under poor conditions and low wages.
Next, I need to identify the key characteristics of the government style associated with limited regulations on business and working conditions. A laissez-faire government style is characterized by minimal government intervention in economic matters, allowing businesses to operate with limited regulations.
Now, I need to compare the characteristics of the government styles listed in the choices. A totalitarian government style is associated with a strong central government controlling all aspects of society, including the economy. A utilitarian government style is associated with a focus on maximizing overall happiness or well-being, but it does not necessarily imply limited regulations on business and working conditions. A corporatist government style is associated with a strong role for business and industry in government decision-making, but it does not necessarily imply limited regulations on business and working conditions.
Based on the characteristics of the government styles, I can conclude that the style most associated with limited regulations on business and working conditions similar to those described in the passage is laissez-faire.

And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land!

Lin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839
Which of the outcomes listed below followed the delivery of Lin Zexu's letter? Choices: a) Chinese naval defeat and new trade terms more favorable to the West b) A successful ban of the opium trade in all Chinese territories c) Violent uprisings on the part of China's pro-British Muslim minority d) The expulsion of all foreigners from Chinese territory 
Output:
First, I need to identify the historical context of the letter. Lin Zexu was a Chinese trade commissioner who wrote to Queen Victoria in 1839, during the First Opium War.
Next, I need to understand the content of the letter. Lin Zexu is arguing against the opium trade, which he believes is harmful to China and its people. He is pointing out the hypocrisy of the British, who prohibit opium in their own country but allow it to be sold in China.
Now, I need to consider the possible outcomes of the letter. Given the historical context, it is unlikely that the letter would lead to a successful ban of the opium trade in all Chinese territories (b), as the British were determined to continue the trade. It is also unlikely that the letter would lead to the expulsion of all foreigners from Chinese territory (d), as the British had already established a significant presence in China.
Considering the options, I believe that the most likely outcome of the letter was the Chinese naval defeat and new trade terms more favorable to the West (a). The British were already in a position of power, and the letter would not have changed the course of the war. The violent uprisings on the part of China's pro-British Muslim minority (c) is not a plausible outcome, as there is no historical evidence to support this.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight.... The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military... was relaxed... ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.
—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon
The author of the above passage claims: ""Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest."" What does he mean by this? Choices: a) The rulers became too rich and thus were overthrown. b) The empire became too large to control effectively. c) Decay begins the minute something begins to grow. d) Conquest and prosperity are mutually exclusive. 
Output:
First, I need to understand what the author means by ""the principle of decay."" The author is suggesting that the very success of the Roman Empire led to its downfall. This is a common theme in history, where the very factors that contribute to an empire's growth and prosperity also contribute to its eventual decline.
Next, I need to consider what the author means by ""the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest."" The author is suggesting that as the Roman Empire expanded its territories through conquest, it also created new problems and challenges that ultimately led to its downfall. This could include the strain on resources, the difficulty of maintaining control over a large and diverse territory, and the potential for rebellion and conflict.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices. Choice a) suggests that the rulers became too rich and were overthrown, but this is not what the author is saying. The author is talking about the empire as a whole, not just the rulers. Choice b) suggests that the empire became too large to control effectively, which is consistent with the author's argument. Choice c) suggests that decay begins the minute something begins to grow, which is a simplistic and overly broad interpretation of the author's argument. Choice d) suggests that conquest and prosperity are mutually exclusive, which is not what the author is saying.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Treaty of Tordesillas, 1494
Which of the following inferences best explains the reason the King of Portugal insisted on Portuguese control of territory east of the demarcation line? Choices: a) Portuguese explorers were convinced that the route to the New World was easier traveled by going east. b) The Portuguese desired to continue the crusades against the Mamelukes who controlled the Holy Land. c) The Portuguese desired control of the wealthy lands of Mexico. d) The Portuguese knew of a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope in the south of Africa. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the Treaty of Tordesillas. The treaty was signed in 1494 between the King of Portugal and the King of Spain, and it established a demarcation line in the ocean sea, dividing the New World between the two powers.
Next, I need to analyze the reasons behind the King of Portugal's insistence on Portuguese control of territory east of the demarcation line. The correct answer is not related to the New World, but rather to the existing trade routes and the desire to control the spice trade.
The Portuguese had been exploring the coast of Africa and had discovered a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope in the south of Africa. This route would allow them to control the spice trade, which was a lucrative business at the time.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

Both authors below were speaking of the French Revolution.
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal... that things in general were settled for ever.

One similarity between the French Revolution and the American Revolution is that both were responses to which of the following? Choices: a) Transformation of the social class structure b) Unfair systems of taxation c) New proposed political structures d) The privileges and influence of religious leaders 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements of the French Revolution and the American Revolution. The French Revolution was a time of great change and upheaval in France, marked by the overthrow of the monarchy and the rise of the middle class. The American Revolution was a colonial revolt that resulted in the formation of the United States.
Next, I need to consider the possible answers and determine which one is most closely related to both revolutions. The transformation of the social class structure is a key element of both revolutions, as both were responses to the growing discontent of the middle class with the privileges and power of the aristocracy.
Now, I need to evaluate the other options and determine if they are also relevant to both revolutions. Unfair systems of taxation were a major factor in the American Revolution, but they were not a primary cause of the French Revolution. New proposed political structures were a result of both revolutions, but they were not a primary cause. The privileges and influence of religious leaders were not a major factor in either revolution.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!
What's this that you have done?
Is 't not a very naughty thing
To snatch the kaiser's crown?
Now you will have to stay away
Alike from Rhine and Prague,
And more than that-shame and dismay
Your days and nights will plague.
Right well you knew, and all the world,
Right well they know this thing,
That Ferdinand alone can be
Bohemia's lawful king.
So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go
To Ferdinand, your king,
And beg him graciously to show
Full pardon for your sin.
""Poor Winter King,"" seventeenth-century song
Which of the following events inspired the composition of this song? Choices: a) Peace of Augsburg b) War of Spanish Succession c) Edict of Nantes d) Thirty Years' War 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements in the song that might indicate the historical event that inspired it. The song mentions the ""Winter King,"" which is a reference to Frederick V, the Elector Palatine who was crowned King of Bohemia in 1619. It also mentions the ""kaiser's crown,"" which refers to the Holy Roman Emperor, and the fact that Frederick V was forced to leave Bohemia and was subsequently exiled.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the time period in which the song was written. The Thirty Years' War was a major conflict that took place in Europe from 1618 to 1648, and it involved many of the major powers of the time, including the Holy Roman Empire, the Kingdom of Bohemia, and the Kingdom of France.
Now, I need to consider the specific events mentioned in the song and how they relate to the Thirty Years' War. The song mentions the fact that Frederick V was forced to leave Bohemia and was subsequently exiled, which is consistent with the events of the Thirty Years' War. The song also mentions the fact that Ferdinand was the lawful king of Bohemia, which is also consistent with the events of the war.

Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, March 25, 1824
Taken together, the two sources best illustrate which of the following aspects of political philosophy in the period circa 1750–1900 C.E.? Choices: a) Constitutions around the world decreed representative governments for their citizens. b) Monarchs exerted a great deal of influence in their nations' governments. c) Military dictatorships often supplanted democratic governments. d) Industrialization propelled societies to demand more social obligations from their governments. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the two sources to understand their content. Source 1 refers to the Fundamental Law Establishing Gran Colombia, which was passed by the Congress of Angostura convened by Simon Bolivar in 1819. This document outlines the unification of the Republics of Venezuela and New Granada under the title of Republic of Colombia. It establishes the executive power of the republic and the role of the president and vice president.
Next, I need to examine Source 2, which refers to the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, passed in 1824. This document outlines the government of the Empire of Brazil, which is a Hereditary Monarchy, constitutional, and Representative. It also establishes the prevailing dynasty and the religion of the empire.
Now, I need to consider the aspects of political philosophy in the period circa 1750–1900 C.E. that are illustrated by the two sources. I notice that both sources refer to the establishment of a government and the role of the executive power. However, the key difference between the two sources is the type of government established. Source 1 refers to a republic, while Source 2 refers to a monarchy.

This great purity of the French Revolution is precisely what causes both our strength and our weakness. Our strength, because it gives to us rights of the public interest over private interests; our weakness, because it rallies all vicious men against us. We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or perish with it; now in this situation, the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror. Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible; it is therefore an emanation of virtue; it is not so much a special principle as it is a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to our country's most urgent needs.

The passage above appears to articulate which of the following political principles? Choices: a) From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs b) Might makes right c) The end justifies the means d) The government is best that governs least 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key phrases in the passage that relate to political principles. The passage mentions ""rights of the public interest over private interests,"" which suggests a focus on the collective good over individual interests.
Next, I need to consider the context in which the passage was written. The French Revolution was a time of great upheaval and violence, and the passage suggests that the author is advocating for a strong and decisive approach to maintaining order and protecting the Revolution.
Now, I need to evaluate the options in light of the passage. Option a) ""From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs"" is a principle associated with socialism and communism, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the passage. Option b) ""Might makes right"" is a principle that suggests that power and strength are the ultimate determinants of what is right, but the passage does not explicitly endorse this view. Option c) ""The end justifies the means"" is a principle that suggests that the goal of an action is more important than the methods used to achieve it, and the passage suggests that the use of terror is justified in order to maintain the Revolution.

First, I need to identify the key ideas in the passage. The passage mentions the idea of meaning transcending human condition, and the author's uncertainty about the meaning of the world.
Next, I need to consider the characteristics of each movement. Existentialism emphasizes individual freedom and choice, and often questions the meaning of life. Religious fundamentalism emphasizes the literal interpretation of religious texts, and often rejects uncertainty. New age syncretism emphasizes the blending of different spiritual practices, and often emphasizes personal growth. Liberation theology emphasizes the role of religion in social justice, and often emphasizes the importance of community.

""Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.""
Nicolo Machiavelli, The Prince, ca. 1513 C.E.
The political philosophy espoused in the text above is different from those of the medieval period in which of the following ways? Choices: a) It accepted the notion that monarchs were justified in asserting their authority. b) It was a pragmatic rather than an ethical or religious ideology. c) It stressed the importance of looking back to the classical past. d) It did not rely upon strong concepts of equality across class boundaries. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the main idea of the text. The text discusses the political philosophy of Nicolo Machiavelli, who argues that it is safer to be feared than loved by your subjects.
Next, I need to compare this idea with the political philosophies of the medieval period. During the medieval period, the dominant political philosophy was the idea of the ""divine right of kings,"" which held that monarchs were justified in asserting their authority because they were appointed by God.
Now, I need to identify the key differences between Machiavelli's philosophy and the medieval philosophy. Machiavelli's philosophy is pragmatic, meaning that it focuses on what works in practice rather than on ethical or religious principles. In contrast, the medieval philosophy was based on a strong sense of morality and religious duty.

Which of the following best accounts for the spread of Islam to the lands of the kingdom of Mali? Choices: a) Muslim missionaries who came from Southern Africa. b) Trade contacts who came from the north across the Sahara. c) Berber armies who conquered the former kingdom of Ghana. d) Pressure from Christian Ethiopia caused the king of Mali to seek Muslim allies. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the geographical location of the kingdom of Mali. It is located in West Africa, and the Sahara Desert is to its north.
Next, I need to think about the historical context of the spread of Islam. Islam spread rapidly in the Middle East and North Africa, and it is likely that trade and cultural exchange played a significant role in its spread to West Africa.
Considering the options, I can eliminate a) Muslim missionaries who came from Southern Africa, as there is no historical evidence to support this. I can also eliminate c) Berber armies who conquered the former kingdom of Ghana, as the text does not mention the kingdom of Ghana or Berber armies.
Now, I need to consider the remaining options. Option b) Trade contacts who came from the north across the Sahara is a plausible explanation, as the Sahara Desert was a major trade route between North Africa and West Africa. Option d) Pressure from Christian Ethiopia caused the king of Mali to seek Muslim allies is unlikely, as there is no historical evidence to support this.
Therefore, the most likely explanation for the spread of Islam to the lands of the kingdom of Mali is {'sol': 'b'}"

Based on the quotation, what is true of Brahman? Choices: a) He is found everywhere and contained in everything. b) He resides in a form of paradise, like Heaven. c) He is found only inside the hearts of the faithful. d) He is a vengeful God, punishing those who sin. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the quotation. The Upanishads are ancient Indian texts that describe the nature of the ultimate reality, which is referred to as Brahman.
Next, I need to analyze the description of Brahman in the quotation. It is said to ""enfold the whole universe"" and be ""loving to all"", which suggests that it is a universal and benevolent force.
Now, I need to consider the options. Option a) says that Brahman is found everywhere and contained in everything, which aligns with the description of it enfolding the whole universe. Option b) suggests a more localized and exclusive concept of Brahman, which does not fit with the universal nature described in the quotation.

""Purusa-Sukta""
Purusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.
It was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.
When they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.

As for their men there is no sexual jealousy in them. And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons.... They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.
—Adapted from an account by Ibn Battuta of his travels in Mali during the 1300s
What was the likely cause of women not wearing the veil? Choices: a) They were probably rebelling against the oppression of women in Islam. b) It was a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern. c) As sexual objects, they were prevented from veiling themselves. d) The climate of Mali makes veiling women impractical. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context in which the women were living. They were in Mali, a region in West Africa, during the 1300s.
Next, I need to consider the cultural practices of the region. In many West African cultures, women do not wear veils as a matter of course.
Finally, I need to consider the information provided in the text. The text states that the women do not veil themselves ""in spite of their perseverance in the prayers,"" which suggests that their not wearing veils is not due to a lack of religiosity.

Non-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments…The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.""

Choices: a) The establishment of formal control over previous colonies by colonial powers b) The establishment of successful democratic regimes in targets of foreign investment c) The development of globalization and the spread of culture through consumerism d) The reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of the text, which is the struggle against neo-colonialism and the need for non-aligned countries to control their own destiny.
Next, I need to analyze the second paragraph, which mentions foreign investment from capitalist countries. The text states that this investment must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State.

The text does not mention the establishment of formal control over previous colonies (a), the establishment of successful democratic regimes (b), or the development of globalization and the spread of culture through consumerism (c). However, it does mention the issue of power, stating that a State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.

Option a) The use of religion to justify gender relations does not seem to be relevant to the texts, as they do not mention gender. Option b) The use of religion to enforce legal norms is also not relevant, as the texts do not discuss specific laws or punishments. Option c) The use of religion to ponder conceptions of the afterlife seems to be the most relevant, as the texts mention the path of life, the river of life, and the consequences of wrongdoing in the afterlife. Option d) The use of religion to explain social hierarchy is not relevant, as the texts do not discuss social classes or hierarchies.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on.
A soldier says simply: ""They call up more every day.
""Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
""But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.""
Du Fu, ""Ballad of the Army Carts,"" ca. 750 C.E.
The poem provides evidence of which of the following as a major cause of later Tang decline? Choices: a) Discontent among the peasantry due to oppressive taxation b) Foreign invasion of the Tang heartlands c) The spread of Buddhism and Taoism as a reaction to state-sponsored Confucianism d) An ineffective bureaucracy and poor leadership 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main theme of the poem. The poem describes the hardships faced by soldiers and the peasants, particularly in the Shanxi region. The soldiers are forced to fight in distant lands, and the peasants are burdened with heavy taxes and the loss of their sons to military service.
Next, I need to analyze the causes of the hardships described in the poem. The poem mentions the oppressive taxation, the heavy burden of military service, and the loss of sons to military service. These are all symptoms of a larger problem: the decline of the Tang dynasty.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) Discontent among the peasantry due to oppressive taxation is a major cause of the decline of the Tang dynasty. The poem describes the peasants as being burdened with heavy taxes and the loss of their sons to military service. This discontent among the peasantry would have contributed to the decline of the Tang dynasty.
Option b) Foreign invasion of the Tang heartlands is not mentioned in the poem. While the Tang dynasty did face foreign invasions, this is not the main theme of the poem.
Option c) The spread of Buddhism and Taoism as a reaction to state-sponsored Confucianism is not mentioned in the poem. While the spread of Buddhism and Taoism did have an impact on Chinese society during the Tang dynasty, this is not the main theme of the poem.
Option d) An ineffective bureaucracy and poor leadership is not mentioned in the poem. While the Tang dynasty did face problems with its bureaucracy and leadership, this is not the main theme of the poem.

Choices: a) A growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods b) Vigorous resistance to European expeditions of conquest c) The establishment of Portuguese trading posts along the coastline d) The consolidation of states along the Atlantic coast of Africa 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements of the first letter. The letter is from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal, and it expresses the King's concern about the kidnapping of his people by Portuguese traders.
Next, I need to consider the context of the letter. The letter was written in 1526, a time when European powers were establishing trade relationships with African kingdoms.
Now, I need to analyze the tone of the letter. The tone is one of complaint and frustration, with the King expressing his concern about the negative impact of European trade on his kingdom.
Considering the options, I can see that the tone of the letter best reflects the development of a growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods. The King is complaining about the negative impact of European trade on his kingdom, which suggests that his kingdom is becoming increasingly dependent on trade with Europe.

Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, March 25, 1824
Which of the following is most directly responsible for creating the constitutions above? Choices: a) Nationalist movements advocating pan-Americanism b) Revolts organized by provincial elites in Latin American nations c) Aboriginal natives gathering the support of provincials to create constitutions d) Colonial powers preparing their colonies for independence 
Output:
First, I need to consider the historical context of the constitutions. The Fundamental Law Establishing Gran Colombia was passed in 1819, while the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil was passed in 1824.
Next, I need to analyze the content of the constitutions. The Fundamental Law Establishing Gran Colombia establishes a federal republic, while the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil establishes a hereditary monarchy.
Now, I need to consider the factors that led to the creation of these constitutions. The Fundamental Law Establishing Gran Colombia was created by the Congress of Angostura, which was convened by Simon Bolivar, a key figure in the Latin American wars of independence. The Constitution of the Empire of Brazil was created by the Emperor Dom Pedro I, who had recently declared Brazil's independence from Portugal.
Considering these factors, I believe that the most direct cause of the creation of these constitutions is the Revolts organized by provincial elites in Latin American nations. These revolts led to the creation of new governments and the establishment of constitutions that reflected the values and goals of the provincial elites.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

Which of the following factors was most important in preventing the fulfillment of the political dreams described in the passage? Choices: a) A lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion b) The spread of communism throughout the continent c) Armed intervention on the part of the Cold War superpowers d) Africa's shortage of natural resources 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of the passage. The passage is about the need for African states to unite in order to achieve their goals and contribute to world peace.
Next, I need to consider the factors that might have prevented the fulfillment of the political dreams described in the passage. The passage does not mention a lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion (choice a) as a factor, nor does it mention the spread of communism (choice b) or Africa's shortage of natural resources (choice d) as a factor.
The passage does mention that the African states have been ""too busy nursing their separate states"" to understand the need for union, which suggests that the main factor preventing the fulfillment of the political dreams is the lack of unity among African states.

Based on your knowledge of world history, which of the following contributed LEAST to Western European global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.? Choices: a) The exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe b) Refinement of gunpowder technologies c) The development and application of steam-powered technologies d) The implementation of joint-stock companies 
Output:
First, I need to consider the time period given, which is between 1450 and 1750 C.E. This was a time of European exploration and colonization.
Next, I need to evaluate each option in the context of this time period.
Option a) The exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe refers to the Columbian Exchange, which occurred during this time period. This exchange had a significant impact on the demographics and economies of both the Americas and Europe.
Option b) Refinement of gunpowder technologies was a key factor in European military superiority during this time period. Gunpowder was used in firearms, which gave European armies a significant advantage over their opponents.
Option c) The development and application of steam-powered technologies did not occur until the Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century. This option is therefore not relevant to the time period given.
Option d) The implementation of joint-stock companies was a key factor in European colonization and trade during this time period. Joint-stock companies such as the East India Company played a significant role in the establishment of European trade routes and the exploitation of colonial resources.

""We are not Europeans; we are not Indians; we are but a mixed species of aborigines and Spaniards. Americans by birth and Europeans by law, we find ourselves engaged in a dual conflict: we are disputing with the natives for titles of ownership, and at the same time we are struggling to maintain ourselves in the country that gave us birth against the opposition of the invaders. Thus our position is most extraordinary and complicated. But there is more. As our role has always been strictly passive and political existence nil, we find that our quest for liberty is now even more difficult of accomplishment; for we, having been placed in a state lower than slavery, had been robbed not only of our freedom but also of the right to exercise an active domestic tyranny…We have been ruled more by deceit than by force, and we have been degraded more by vice than by superstition. Slavery is the daughter of darkness: an ignorant people is a blind instrument of its own destruction. Ambition and intrigue abuses the credulity and experience of men lacking all political, economic, and civic knowledge; they adopt pure illusion as reality; they take license for liberty, treachery for patriotism, and vengeance for justice. If a people, perverted by their training, succeed in achieving their liberty, they will soon lose it, for it would be of no avail to endeavor to explain to them that happiness consists in the practice of virtue; that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of tyrants, because, as the laws are more inflexible, every one should submit to their beneficent austerity; that proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law; and that to practice justice is to practice liberty.""

The observations expressed in the excerpt are best seen as evidence for which of the following in Yuan China? Choices: a) Policies of religious toleration b) Instatement of foreigners as provincial administrators c) Mongol assimilation into Chinese culture d) Military pressures from internal unrest 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key points in the excerpt. Ibn Battuta mentions that the Chinese are infidels, but he also notes that the King of China is a Tartar and a descendant of Genghis Khan. This suggests that the Mongols were in power in China.
Next, I need to look for evidence of the Mongols' policies towards different religious groups. Ibn Battuta mentions that there are towns for Muslims, with cells, colleges, and mosques, and that the Muslims are made much of by the Kings of China. This suggests that the Mongols were tolerant of Islam.
Now, I need to consider the other options. Option b) Instatement of foreigners as provincial administrators is not supported by the text, as Ibn Battuta does not mention anything about foreigners being in charge of provinces. Option c) Mongol assimilation into Chinese culture is also not supported, as Ibn Battuta notes that the King of China is a Tartar, suggesting that the Mongols were still distinct from the Chinese. Option d) Military pressures from internal unrest is not supported, as Ibn Battuta does not mention anything about internal unrest or military pressures.

""Upon their arrival they were honorably and graciously received by the grand Khan, in a full assembly of his principal officers. When they drew nigh to his person, they paid their respects by prostrating themselves on the floor. He immediately commanded them to rise, and to relate to him the circumstances of their travels, with all that had taken place in their negotiation with his holiness the pope. To their narrative, which they gave in the regular order of events, and delivered in perspicuous language, he listened with attentive silence. The letters and the presents from pope Gregory were then laid before him, and, upon hearing the former read, he bestowed much commendation on the fidelity, the zeal, and the diligence of his ambassadors; and receiving with due reverence the oil from the holy sepulchre, he gave directions that it should be preserved with religious care. Upon his observing Marco Polo, and inquiring who he was, Nicolo made answer, This is your servant, and my son; upon which the grand Khan replied, ""He is welcome, and it pleases me much,"" and he caused him to be enrolled amongst his attendants of honor. And on account of their return he made a great feast and rejoicing; and as long as the said brothers and Marco remained in the court of the grand Khan, they were honored even above his own courtiers. Marco was held in high estimation and respect by all belonging to the court. He learnt in a short time and adopted the manners of the Tartars, and acquired a proficiency in four different languages, which he became qualified to read and write.""

Choices: a) The economic dominance of the Ottoman Empire b) The influence of Middle Eastern religious beliefs on the peoples of South Asia c) The lack of cooperation among major political groups in the High Middle Ages d) Amiable cultural exchange between Europe and Asia 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements of the encounter described in the account. The grand Khan receives the travelers honorably and graciously, and they are able to relate their story and present gifts to him. The grand Khan is impressed by the travelers' narrative and the gifts they bring, and he shows them great respect and honor.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the encounter. The account is set in the court of the grand Khan, which was the ruler of the Mongol Empire. The Mongol Empire was a vast and powerful empire that stretched from China to Eastern Europe, and it was known for its tolerance and openness to different cultures.
Now, I need to evaluate the options in light of the key elements and historical context. Option a) The economic dominance of the Ottoman Empire is incorrect because the Ottoman Empire did not exist until the 14th century, and the account is set in the 13th century. Option b) The influence of Middle Eastern religious beliefs on the peoples of South Asia is also incorrect because the account does not mention any religious beliefs or practices. Option c) The lack of cooperation among major political groups in the High Middle Ages is incorrect because the account describes a peaceful and cooperative encounter between the travelers and the grand Khan. Option d) Amiable cultural exchange between Europe and Asia is the most plausible option because the account describes a friendly and respectful encounter between the travelers and the grand Khan, and it highlights the cultural exchange that took place between them.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die.

Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know.
…
He looked to the West and prayed, ""I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures. If I am fated to have a disciple, may I be able to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King to come with me to the Vulture Peak. If I am not fated to have a disciple, and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good, then may I be unable to remove the seal."" When he had prayed he bowed again.
From Wu Chengen, Journey to the West, ca. 1590s
In which of the following ways does the excerpt above most complicate historians' understanding of the career of the Chinese monk and traveler Xuanzang? Choices: a) It highly fictionalizes the story of Xuanzang's accomplishments. b) It was written long after the time period in which Xuanzang lived. c) It casts doubt on the actual existence of Xuanzang. d) It is widely considered by scholars to be a forgery. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the historical context of the excerpt. The Journey to the West was written by Wu Chengen in the 1590s, more than 600 years after Xuanzang's time.
Next, I need to evaluate the nature of the text. The excerpt is a fictionalized account of Xuanzang's life, with elements such as the divine Monkey King and the seal on the golden words that are not historically accurate.
Now, I need to consider the potential impact of the text on historians' understanding of Xuanzang's career. While the text may provide some insight into the cultural and religious beliefs of the time, its fictionalized nature and historical distance from the events it describes make it a problematic source for historians.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
As for their men there is no sexual jealousy in them. And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons.... They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.
—Adapted from an account by Ibn Battuta of his travels in Mali during the 1300s
The most likely source of Islam in Mali came from Choices: a) wandering Berber mystics. b) conquering Mughal armies. c) contact with Muslim trade caravans. d) pilgrims to Islamic shrines in Ethiopia. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the geographical location of Mali. Mali is a landlocked country in West Africa, and it is not directly connected to the Middle East or South Asia, where Islam originated.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of Mali. During the 1300s, Mali was a major center of trade, with merchants traveling along the trans-Saharan trade routes. It is likely that Muslim traders would have traveled along these routes, bringing Islam with them.
Now, I need to consider the cultural context of Mali. The account by Ibn Battuta describes a society that is already familiar with Islamic practices, such as prayer and the study of Islamic jurisprudence. This suggests that Islam had already been present in Mali for some time.
Therefore, the most likely source of Islam in Mali is Muslim trade caravans, which would have brought Islam to the region through trade and cultural exchange. {'sol': 'c'}"

""We are not Europeans; we are not Indians; we are but a mixed species of aborigines and Spaniards. Americans by birth and Europeans by law, we find ourselves engaged in a dual conflict: we are disputing with the natives for titles of ownership, and at the same time we are struggling to maintain ourselves in the country that gave us birth against the opposition of the invaders. Thus our position is most extraordinary and complicated. But there is more. As our role has always been strictly passive and political existence nil, we find that our quest for liberty is now even more difficult of accomplishment; for we, having been placed in a state lower than slavery, had been robbed not only of our freedom but also of the right to exercise an active domestic tyranny…We have been ruled more by deceit than by force, and we have been degraded more by vice than by superstition. Slavery is the daughter of darkness: an ignorant people is a blind instrument of its own destruction. Ambition and intrigue abuses the credulity and experience of men lacking all political, economic, and civic knowledge; they adopt pure illusion as reality; they take license for liberty, treachery for patriotism, and vengeance for justice. If a people, perverted by their training, succeed in achieving their liberty, they will soon lose it, for it would be of no avail to endeavor to explain to them that happiness consists in the practice of virtue; that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of tyrants, because, as the laws are more inflexible, every one should submit to their beneficent austerity; that proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law; and that to practice justice is to practice liberty.""
Simón de Bolívar, Message to the Congress of Angostura, 1819
The author of this text expresses a belief in which of the following as requirements for a properly functioning legal system? Choices: a) Truth and religion b) Freedom and democracy c) Intelligence and order d) Morality and justice 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key concepts expressed in the text. The author mentions that a people ""perverted by their training"" will lose their liberty, implying that a lack of knowledge or understanding is a problem. The author also emphasizes the importance of ""virtue"" and ""proper morals"" in achieving happiness and a functioning legal system.
Next, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) Truth and religion is not mentioned in the text as a requirement for a functioning legal system. Option b) Freedom and democracy is also not mentioned, although the author does mention the importance of liberty. Option c) Intelligence and order is not explicitly mentioned, although the author does mention the importance of knowledge and understanding.
Finally, I need to consider option d) Morality and justice. The author explicitly states that ""to practice justice is to practice liberty"" and that ""proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law."" This suggests that the author believes that morality and justice are essential requirements for a properly functioning legal system.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

""Purusa-Sukta""
Purusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.
It was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.
When they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.

Which of the following would best contradict the argument that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles on Indian society in the period 600 BCE to 600 CE? Choices: a) For there is nothing better for a Kshatriya than a righteous battle. b) The four divisions of human society are created by me Krishna. c) The person traditionally credited with composing the Mahabarata was born to a fisherwoman. d) The Hindu God Shiva is considered to be simultaneously the creator, the preserver, and the destroyer. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the argument that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles on Indian society in the period 600 BCE to 600 CE. This argument suggests that the caste system was a rigid and unchanging social hierarchy that determined an individual's economic and social status based on their birth.
Next, I need to analyze the options to see which one would best contradict this argument. Option a) suggests that a Kshatriya (a member of the warrior caste) values a righteous battle, implying that their social role is not rigidly defined. Option b) suggests that the four divisions of human society (the caste system) were created by Krishna, implying that the caste system is a divine institution and therefore not subject to change. Option c) suggests that the person credited with composing the Mahabarata was born to a fisherwoman, implying that social mobility is possible and that individuals can rise above their birth. Option d) suggests that the Hindu God Shiva is considered to be simultaneously the creator, the preserver, and the destroyer, which does not directly relate to the caste system.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

""The question as to who, and what, is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels. Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.""
Walter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974
Rodney's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.? Choices: a) The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers b) The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World c) The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa d) The importation of New World products into Africa 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main argument of Rodney's passage. Rodney argues that the imperialist system is responsible for African underdevelopment.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the passage. The passage mentions the extension of European exploitation to cover the whole of Africa, which suggests that the passage is referring to a period of European colonization of Africa.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers is the most likely development that Rodney's argument is responding to. This is because the passage mentions the extension of European exploitation to cover the whole of Africa, which suggests that the passage is referring to a period of European colonization of Africa.

The following poem refers to an incident in Sharpeville, South Africa, in 1960. To protest the requirement that they carry papers documenting their identity and residence, black South Africans gathered in front of police stations without their papers. Though other protests ended peacefully, in Sharpeville, police fired into the crowd.
What is important
about Sharpeville
is not that seventy died:
nor even that they were shot in the back
retreating, unarmed, defenceless
and certainty not
the heavy caliber slug
that tore through a mother's back
and ripped through the child in her arms
killing it
Remember Sharpeville
bullet-in-the-back day
Because it epitomized oppression
and the nature of society
More clearly than anything else;
it was the classic event
Nowhere is racial dominance
more clearly defined
nowhere the will to oppress
more clearly demonstrated
What the world whispers
apartheid declares with snarling guns
the blood the rich lust after
South Africa spills dust
Remember Sharpeville
Remember bullet-in-the-back day
And remember the unquenchable will for freedom
Remember the dead
and be glad
—Dennis Brutus, 1973
What does the poet mean by ""what the world whispers""? Choices: a) The world is too afraid of South Africa to oppose apartheid. b) The world engages in subtler forms of discrimination. c) The world condemns South Africa’s discrimination. d) The world economy promotes South Africa’s discrimination. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the poem. The poem refers to the Sharpeville incident in 1960, where police fired into a crowd of unarmed black South Africans, killing 70 people.
Next, I need to analyze the phrase ""what the world whispers"". The poet is highlighting the contrast between the subtle and quiet nature of the world's criticism of South Africa's apartheid regime, and the loud and violent declaration of apartheid through the use of snarling guns.
Now, I need to consider the possible meanings of ""what the world whispers"". Option a) suggests that the world is too afraid to oppose apartheid, which is not the focus of the poem. Option c) suggests that the world condemns South Africa's discrimination, which is the opposite of what the poem is saying. Option d) suggests that the world economy promotes apartheid, which is not the focus of the poem.

Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them.... He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.

What was the world history event occurring in the stated time frame that caused the Soviet Union to enter Korea? Choices: a) The Crimean War b) World War I c) World War II d) The Seven Years’ War 
Output:
First, I need to identify the time frame in which the event occurred. The text mentions that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there, and that the nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. This suggests that the event occurred during the early stages of the Cold War, when the Soviet Union and the United States were competing for influence in East Asia.
Next, I need to consider the major world history events that occurred during this time frame. The Crimean War (1853-1856) and the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) are both too early to be relevant. World War I (1914-1918) also occurred too early.
Now, I need to consider the event that is most likely to have caused the Soviet Union to enter Korea. World War II (1939-1945) was a global conflict that involved the Soviet Union and the United States as allies, but it also led to the division of Korea into North and South Korea. The Soviet Union's entry into Korea was likely a response to the end of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the quotation. The speaker is describing a higher power, which they refer to as the Spirit and Brahman.
Next, I need to analyze the speaker's description of the Spirit. The Spirit is described as enfolding the whole universe and loving to all, which suggests a universal and all-encompassing deity.
Now, I need to consider the speaker's statement about their afterlife. The speaker says that they will come to the Spirit when they go beyond this life, which implies that they believe in an afterlife.

Although in Protestant Europe, [Peter the Great] was surrounded by evidence of the new civil and political rights of individual men embodied in constitutions, bills of rights and parliaments, he did not return to Russia determined to share power with his people. On the contrary, he returned not only determined to change his country but also convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force. He would try to lead; but where education and persuasion were not enough, he could drive—and if necessary flog—the backward nation forward.

When Peter the Great ruled Russia, he continued the practice of which of the following? Choices: a) Decentralization of power b) Isolationism c) Serfdom d) Reform 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. Peter the Great ruled Russia and was determined to change his country.
Next, I need to identify the practice that Peter the Great continued. The passage states that Peter the Great was determined to lead and drive the nation forward, but if necessary, he could flog the backward nation.
Now, I need to analyze the options. Decentralization of power (a) is the opposite of what Peter the Great did, as he wanted to lead and drive the nation forward. Isolationism (b) is not mentioned in the passage. Reform (d) is also not mentioned in the passage.
The only option that is consistent with the passage is serfdom (c), as Peter the Great was willing to flog the backward nation, which implies that he was willing to use force to control the people, a characteristic of serfdom.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

""Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighboring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations does not make us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our chief safeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws, particularly such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they are actually on the statute book, or belong to that code which, although unwritten, yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace.""

Output:
First, I need to identify the key information in the text that refers to who is allowed to participate in the democratic process. The text states that ""advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit.""
Next, I need to consider the context of the time period in which the text was written. The text was written in ancient Greece, specifically in the 5th century BCE.
Now, I need to analyze the options in light of the key information and the context. Option a) All adult men born within the geographic boundaries of the state is a strong candidate, as it aligns with the idea that ""all adult men"" are allowed to participate in the democratic process. Option b) All adult men and women born within the geographic boundaries of the state is unlikely, as women were not typically allowed to participate in the democratic process in ancient Greece. Option c) All adult men who were citizens of the state by birth is also a strong candidate, as it aligns with the idea that ""all adult men"" are allowed to participate in the democratic process. Option d) All adult men and women who were citizens of the state by birth is unlikely, as women were not typically allowed to participate in the democratic process in ancient Greece.

The ""revolutions"" spoken of by Sukarno in the passage above most likely relate to which of the following causes? Choices: a) Gender equality b) Communism c) Decolonization d) Environmental conservation 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. Sukarno is referring to the ""revolutions"" that are happening in Asia and Africa.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the time period. The Bandung Conference was held in 1955, a time when many countries in Asia and Africa were gaining independence from colonial rule.
Now, I need to analyze the language used by Sukarno. He mentions ""our revolutions"" and ""our countries,"" suggesting that he is referring to a collective movement or struggle.
Based on this analysis, I believe that the ""revolutions"" spoken of by Sukarno most likely relate to decolonization, the process of gaining independence from colonial rule. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

Choices: a) Ancient cities lacked effective fortifications against attack. b) Ancient cities featured areas for worshipping their patron deities. c) Ancient cities commonly decorated their temples in modest ways. d) Ancient cities featured areas for training their armies. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key points about Uruk mentioned in the text. The text states that Gilgamesh built the great rampart of Uruk and the wall of the sacred Eanna temple, which is the holy sanctuary. It also mentions that the wall of Uruk is made of burned brick and its foundation was laid by the Seven Sages.
Next, I need to consider the characteristics of ancient cities that are mentioned in the text. The text does not mention anything about the effectiveness of fortifications against attack, so I can rule out choice a. The text does mention the Eanna temple, which is the dwelling place of Ishtar, and the precinct for the temple of Ishtar, so I can rule out choice c. The text does not mention anything about training armies, so I can rule out choice d.
Finally, I need to consider the statement that is most supported by the discussion of Uruk in the text. The text mentions the Eanna temple and the precinct for the temple of Ishtar, which suggests that ancient cities featured areas for worshipping their patron deities.

Letter from a Jewish trader in India to his wife in Cairo, ca. 1200
The passage above is best seen in light of which of the following historical developments? Choices: a) The formation of far-flung diaspora communities as a result of interregional commerce b) The continued use of organized religion to justify patriarchy c) The permanent division of families due to armed conflict along established trade routes d) The evolution of family structure among polytheistic populations 
Output:
First, I need to consider the historical context of the passage. The letter is from a Jewish trader in India to his wife in Cairo, which suggests that the writer and his wife are separated by a significant distance.
Next, I need to analyze the content of the letter. The writer is giving his wife the option to divorce him, citing the long wait and the uncertainty of his return. This suggests that the writer is aware of the difficulties of maintaining a long-distance relationship and is offering his wife a way out.
Now, I need to consider the historical developments listed in the choices. Choice a) The formation of far-flung diaspora communities as a result of interregional commerce is a plausible explanation for the situation described in the passage. The writer and his wife are separated by a significant distance, which is likely due to the writer's involvement in interregional commerce.
Choice b) The continued use of organized religion to justify patriarchy is not directly relevant to the passage. While the writer does mention the Creator, the focus of the passage is on the practicalities of the situation rather than the religious justifications for it.
Choice c) The permanent division of families due to armed conflict along established trade routes is not supported by the passage. There is no mention of conflict or violence, and the writer's situation is portrayed as a result of his business activities rather than any conflict.
Choice d) The evolution of family structure among polytheistic populations is not relevant to the passage. The writer is a Jew, and the passage does not suggest any connection to polytheistic populations.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

First, I need to analyze the tone of the second text. The text emphasizes the importance of truth and moral behavior, stating that wrongdoing has never brought its venture to port and that those whom the gods guide cannot lose themselves.
Next, I need to consider the implications of this tone. The text suggests that moral behavior has consequences, and that those who follow the path of truth will be guided by the gods.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) is incorrect because the text does not mention compassion as a virtue. Option c) is incorrect because the text promotes a path of truth and moral behavior, rather than a strict ""eye for an eye"" code. Option d) is incorrect because the text does not mention rituals or offerings.

The journal suggests that the Indian Ocean trade network is a hub of cultural exchange and economic activity, with merchants from different countries interacting and trading with each other.
The journal does not suggest that Arabian port cities are superior to others, so option b is not the best answer. The journal also does not mention language barriers as a significant issue, so option c is not the best answer. Finally, the journal does not mention cash crops, so option d is not the best answer.

Which of the following contributed LEAST to the decline of the Roman Empire? Choices: a) Civil wars between rivals for the throne b) Incursions of barbarian peoples into the empire c) The persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire d) Demographic weakness on account of diseases and epidemics 
Output:
First, I need to identify the factors that contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire. The passage mentions that the Roman Empire benefited from the conflict between the Tencteri and the Chamavi and Angrivarii, as it allowed the Romans to watch the spectacle of the conflict and even benefited from the outcome.
Next, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) Civil wars between rivals for the throne is a well-known factor that contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire, as it weakened the empire's stability and created power vacuums that were exploited by external enemies.
Option b) Incursions of barbarian peoples into the empire is also a factor that contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire, as it weakened the empire's military and economic strength.
Option d) Demographic weakness on account of diseases and epidemics is another factor that contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire, as it reduced the empire's population and weakened its ability to defend itself.
Option c) The persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire is not mentioned in the passage as a factor that contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire. In fact, the passage suggests that the Roman Empire benefited from the conflict between the Tencteri and the Chamavi and Angrivarii, which implies that the Roman Empire was still a strong and effective power at the time.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!
What's this that you have done?
Is 't not a very naughty thing
To snatch the kaiser's crown?
Now you will have to stay away
Alike from Rhine and Prague,
And more than that-shame and dismay
Your days and nights will plague.
Right well you knew, and all the world,

That Ferdinand alone can be
Bohemia's lawful king.
So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go
To Ferdinand, your king,
And beg him graciously to show
Full pardon for your sin.
""Poor Winter King,"" seventeenth-century song
The narrator of the song would most likely identify as which of the following? Choices: a) Roman Catholic b) Eastern Orthodox c) Protestant d) Muslim 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements in the song that provide information about the narrator's identity. The song mentions the ""Winter King,"" which is a reference to Frederick V, the Elector Palatine who was the leader of the Protestant Union in the Thirty Years' War. The song also mentions the ""kaiser,"" which is a reference to the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II, who was a Roman Catholic.
Next, I need to analyze the language and tone of the song to determine the narrator's perspective. The song is written in a style that is critical of the Winter King and sympathetic to the Holy Roman Emperor, which suggests that the narrator is not a Protestant.
Finally, I need to consider the historical context in which the song was written. The Thirty Years' War was a conflict between Protestant and Catholic states in Europe, and the song's language and tone suggest that it was written from a Catholic perspective.
Therefore, the narrator of the song would most likely identify as {'sol': 'a'}"

""The quicksilver mines of Huancavelica are where the poor Indians are so harshly punished, where they are tortured and so many Indians die; it is there that the noble caciques [headmen] of this kingdom are finished off and tortured. The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]….The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year….
And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.
And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines….And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]…at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.
There is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him….Even the protector of the Indians is useless;…he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.""

Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala, The First New Chronicle and Good Government, ca. 1610
Compared to the practices in the excerpt, English treatment of the natives in the New World differed in that they Choices: a) viewed the natives as true equals as they settled the Americas b) were confused by the natives' lack of a notion of land ownership c) widely did not condone intermingling with the natives d) used the natives exclusively for harvesting cash crops, like tobacco and cotton 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the excerpt. Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala is describing the harsh treatment of the indigenous people in the mines of Peru by the Spanish colonizers.
Next, I need to compare this treatment to the English treatment of the natives in the New World. The excerpt mentions that the Spanish colonizers viewed the natives as inferior and exploited them for their labor and resources.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) is incorrect because the English did not view the natives as true equals. Option b) is also incorrect because the English were aware of the natives' notion of land ownership. Option c) is incorrect because the English did not widely condone intermingling with the natives, but rather sought to convert them to Christianity. Option d) is the correct answer because the English used the natives exclusively for harvesting cash crops, like tobacco and cotton.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

""To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak––therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty––therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.
That is why we must no longer lag behind.""
Joseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931
The reference to the ""continual beatings"" most directly supports which of the following decisions in later Soviet foreign policy? Choices: a) The invasion of Afghanistan b) The creation of the Warsaw Pact c) The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe d) The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the speech by Joseph Stalin. The speech emphasizes the importance of not falling behind in terms of military, cultural, political, industrial, and agricultural development. It highlights the history of Russia being beaten by other nations due to its backwardness.
Next, I need to analyze the options in the context of Soviet foreign policy. The invasion of Afghanistan (option a) was a response to the Soviet Union's own security concerns and the perceived threat of Islamic fundamentalism, rather than a direct response to the idea of not falling behind.
The creation of the Warsaw Pact (option b) was a response to the formation of NATO and the perceived threat of Western military power, rather than a direct response to the idea of not falling behind.
The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine (option c) was a response to the Soviet Union's own security concerns and the perceived threat of anti-Soviet protesters in Eastern Europe, rather than a direct response to the idea of not falling behind.
The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II (option d) was a response to Japan's military aggression and the Soviet Union's own security concerns, rather than a direct response to the idea of not falling behind.
However, the reference to the ""continual beatings"" most directly supports the creation of the Warsaw Pact, as it emphasizes the importance of not falling behind in terms of military development and the need to counter the perceived threat of Western military power.

Then is the time, my love, to pour the wine.
the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám
Both verses relate most closely to Choices: a) key economic processes within Islamic society. b) production of food and drink in Islamic society. c) religious regulation of personal behavior in Islamic society. d) changing gender relations in Islamic society. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements in the verses. The first verse mentions strong drink and games of chance, which are associated with infamy and Satan's handiwork. The second verse mentions roses in bloom and pouring wine, which suggests a celebration or festive atmosphere.
Next, I need to consider the context of the verses. The first verse is from the Qur'an, which is a sacred text in Islam, and it explicitly prohibits strong drink and games of chance. The second verse is from the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám, which is a poem from a different cultural and religious tradition.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) key economic processes within Islamic society is not directly related to the verses, which focus on personal behavior rather than economic processes. Option b) production of food and drink in Islamic society is also not directly related, as the verses focus on the consumption of strong drink rather than its production. Option c) religious regulation of personal behavior in Islamic society is the most relevant option, as the verses explicitly prohibit strong drink and games of chance and promote a moral code. Option d) changing gender relations in Islamic society is not directly related to the verses, which do not mention gender at all.

Output:
First, I need to consider the context of the passage. The letter is from a Jewish trader in India to his wife in Cairo, which suggests that the merchant has been away from his wife for a long time.
Next, I need to analyze the content of the letter. The merchant is offering his wife a bill of repudiation, which implies that he is giving her the opportunity to end their marriage.
Now, I need to consider the possible causes of the marital strain. Option a) The strain placed on merchant families by long periods of separation is a plausible cause, as the merchant has been away from his wife for a long time. Option b) Religious disagreements arising from the merchant's exposure to Hinduism is unlikely, as there is no mention of Hinduism in the passage. Option c) A decision on the part of the merchant to remain permanently in India is also unlikely, as the merchant is still in India and is writing to his wife in Cairo. Option d) Bankruptcy stranding the merchant far from home is unlikely, as there is no mention of bankruptcy in the passage.
Therefore, the most probable cause of the marital strain is {'sol': 'a'}"

What events might have prompted the poet to compose this piece? Choices: a) The discovery of the Zimmerman Telegram b) The embargo of Cuba after Castro’s revolution c) U.S. involvement in Panama’s independence d) U.S. involvement in the Haitian Revolution 
Output:
First, I need to consider the historical context in which the poem was written. The poem was written in 1904 by Ruben Dario, a Nicaraguan poet.
Next, I need to identify the events that might have prompted the poet to compose this piece. The poem is a response to the growing influence of the United States in the region, particularly in Central America and the Caribbean.
The U.S. had been expanding its influence in the region through various means, including military interventions, economic domination, and diplomatic pressure.
Considering the options provided, I need to determine which event might have prompted the poet to compose this piece.
The discovery of the Zimmerman Telegram (a) is not relevant to the poem, as it occurred in 1917, more than a decade after the poem was written.
The embargo of Cuba after Castro’s revolution (b) is also not relevant, as it occurred in the 1960s, more than 50 years after the poem was written.
U.S. involvement in Panama’s independence (c) is a possible event that might have prompted the poet to compose this piece, as the U.S. had been involved in the region for some time and was likely seen as a threat by the poet.
U.S. involvement in the Haitian Revolution (d) is not relevant, as the Haitian Revolution occurred in the early 19th century, more than a century before the poem was written.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight.... The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military... was relaxed... ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.

Output:
First, I need to consider the causes of the decline of the Roman Empire. According to the passage, the decline was caused by the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness, the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest, and the artificial supports were removed, leading to the pressure of its own weight.
Next, I need to consider the causes of the decline of the Chinese counterpart. Although the passage does not explicitly state the causes, it is implied that the decline was also caused by the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness and the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest.
Now, I need to consider the effects of the decline of the Roman Empire and its Chinese counterpart. The passage does not explicitly state the effects, but it can be inferred that the decline would result in a shift from trade along the Silk Roads to sea routes in the Indian Ocean, as the Roman Empire and the Chinese counterpart were the major powers controlling the Silk Roads.

What term best describes Peter the Great's ruling style as described in the passage? Choices: a) Egalitarian b) Absolutist c) Republican d) Theocratic 
Output:
First, I need to understand the key terms in the passage. The passage describes Peter the Great as someone who is determined to change his country and provide both the direction and the motive force. This suggests that he has a strong sense of authority and control.
Next, I need to consider the options. Egalitarian refers to a system where everyone has equal rights and power, which is not consistent with Peter's description. Republican refers to a system where power is held by the people, which is also not consistent with Peter's description. Theocratic refers to a system where power is held by a religious leader, which is not mentioned in the passage.
The term that best fits Peter's description is Absolutist, which refers to a system where power is held by a single person, often with little or no input from others. This is consistent with Peter's statement that he will provide both the direction and the motive force.

But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!

The city of Ghana consists of two towns. One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables.... The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means.... The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms.... He sits... in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols.... On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals.... The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani.

What is the most likely explanation for a Muslim being in charge of the Ghanian treasury? Choices: a) To facilitate trade with the predominantly Muslim merchants during this era. b) The king of Ghana had recently become a Muslim. c) Merchants and trade were considered taboo in the traditional pagan religion. d) African kings were merely vassals of the Muslim caliphs. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the historical context of the passage. The passage is from the eleventh century, a time when Islam was expanding its influence in Africa.
Next, I need to analyze the information provided about the king of Ghana. The king is described as wearing adornments and sitting in a domed pavilion, which suggests that he is a pagan ruler.
However, the king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury, and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. This suggests that there is a significant Muslim presence in the king's court.
Now, I need to consider the possible explanations for a Muslim being in charge of the Ghanian treasury. Option a) is plausible, as trade with Muslim merchants would have been an important aspect of the king's economy. Option b) is unlikely, as the king is described as a pagan ruler. Option c) is also unlikely, as there is no evidence to suggest that trade was considered taboo in the traditional pagan religion. Option d) is unlikely, as there is no evidence to suggest that African kings were vassals of the Muslim caliphs.
Therefore, the most likely explanation is that the king of Ghana had recently become a Muslim, {'sol': 'b'}."

""From the confines of Jerusalem and the city of Constantinople a horrible tale has gone forth and very frequently has been brought to our ears, namely, that a race from the kingdom of the Persians, an accursed race, a race utterly alienated from God, a generation forsooth which has not directed its heart and has not entrusted its spirit to God, has invaded the lands of those Christians and has depopulated them by the sword, pillage and fire; it has led away a part of the captives into its own country, and a part it has destroyed by cruel tortures; it has either entirely destroyed the churches of God or appropriated them for the rites of its own religion….The kingdom of the Greeks is now dismembered by them and deprived of territory so vast in extent that it cannot be traversed in a march of two months. On whom therefore is the labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering this territory incumbent, if not upon you? You, upon whom above other nations God has conferred remarkable glory in arms, great courage, bodily activity, and strength to humble the hairy scalp of those who resist you.
Let the deeds of your ancestors move you and incite your minds to manly achievements; the glory and greatness of king Charles the Great, and of his son Louis, and of your other kings, who have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans, and extended in these lands the territory of the holy church. Let the holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior, which is possessed by unclean nations, especially incite you, and the holy places which are now treated with ignominy and irreverently polluted with their filthiness. Oh, most valiant soldiers and descendants of invincible ancestors, be not degenerate, but recall the valor of your progenitors.
Jerusalem is the navel of the world; the land is fruitful above others, like another paradise of delights. This the Redeemer of the human race has made illustrious by His advent, has beautified by residence, has consecrated by suffering, has redeemed by death, has glorified by burial. This royal city, therefore, situated at the center of the world, is now held captive by His enemies, and is in subjection to those who do not know God, to the worship of the heathens. She seeks therefore and desires to be liberated and does not cease to implore you to come to her aid. From you especially she asks succor, because, as we have already said, God has conferred upon you above all nations great glory in arms. Accordingly undertake this journey for the remission of your sins, with the assurance of the imperishable glory of the kingdom of heaven.""
Pope Urban II, Speech at the Council of Clermont as recorded by Robert the Monk, 1095 C.E.
Urban II's discussion of Jerusalem in the third paragraph is best understood in the context of which of the following? Choices: a) Pilgrimages to centers of religious significance b) Eradication of heresies c) The reconstruction of trade routes d) Developments in religious art 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the speech. The speech is given by Pope Urban II at the Council of Clermont in 1095 C.E. and is a call to arms for the First Crusade.
Next, I need to identify the key elements of the speech. The speech emphasizes the importance of Jerusalem, describing it as the ""navel of the world"" and the ""holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior.""
Now, I need to consider the options in the context of the speech. Option a) Pilgrimages to centers of religious significance is the most relevant, as the speech is a call to arms for the First Crusade, which was motivated by a desire to reclaim Jerusalem and other holy sites from Muslim control.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

Woman, wake up; the bell of reason is being heard throughout the whole universe; discover your rights. Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!
Olympe de Gouges, ""Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,"" 1791
The independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fear—but apart from that, nothing has changed.
Halima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence
Publication of the first passage was followed by which of the political outcomes described below? Choices: a) French women, like Jews, Protestants, and freed blacks, attained political equality after only a short delay. b) French women quickly gained the right to vote, but not to hold political office. c) French women found their status even lower than it had been before the French Revolution. d) French women remained without full political rights until well into the following century. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context of the two passages. The first passage is from Olympe de Gouges, a French woman who wrote the ""Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen"" in 1791. This document was a call to action for women's rights and equality.
Next, I need to consider the content of the second passage. Halima Ghomri, an Algerian woman, is expressing her disappointment with the outcome of Algeria's war of independence. She had hoped for significant changes in her life, but instead, she found that her situation remained largely the same.
Now, I need to consider the historical context of the French Revolution. The French Revolution was a time of great social and political change, but it did not necessarily lead to equal rights for women. In fact, women's rights were often overlooked or ignored during this period.
Based on this analysis, I would conclude that the correct answer is d) French women remained without full political rights until well into the following century. This outcome is consistent with the historical record, which shows that women's rights were not fully realized until much later, in the 20th century.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.
British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860
Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.
Rudrangshu Mukherjee, ""The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,"" 1990
From the perspective of the first passage, the death of British citizens at Cawnpore Choices: a) seems to mark a betrayal of a ""higher"" race by a ""lesser"" race. b) should be seen as a regrettable but avoidable mistake. c) can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves. d) was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the Cawnpore massacres. The passage describes the event as a peculiar aggravation, implying that it was an unexpected and disturbing occurrence.
Next, I need to analyze the perspective of the passage. The author, William Howard Russell, views the event as a betrayal by a subject race, implying that the British were superior to the Indians and that the Indians' actions were a violation of this superiority.
Now, I need to consider the options in light of this perspective. Option a) seems to align with the author's view, as it implies that the death of British citizens was a betrayal of a higher race by a lesser race. Option b) does not align with the author's view, as it implies that the event was regrettable but avoidable, which does not fit with the author's emphasis on the betrayal. Option c) also does not align with the author's view, as it implies that the British themselves were responsible for the event, which is not supported by the passage. Option d) is not supported by the passage, as it implies that the killing of British citizens was a religious duty, which is not mentioned in the passage.

Questions to the passage below, an account given to a French officer in Algeria in the 1830s by a member of an Arab slave trade caravan.
The Slave Trade
All of you [soldiers], are summoned... to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""].... The soldiery divided themselves into two companies... with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields.... Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries
A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women.... It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own.... Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk.... They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.
How was the Arab trade in Africans different from the Atlantic slave trade? Choices: a) Unlike Arab slave merchants, those involved in the Atlantic slave trade were motivated by religion. b) Slaves taken for the Atlantic slave trade had no prospect of eventual liberty, but slaves taken by Arab merchants did. c) Slaves taken for the Atlantic trade were predominantly female; slaves taken by Arab merchants were mostly male. d) Slaves taken by Arab merchants were likely to have a shorter life span than those taken for the Atlantic trade. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the motivations behind the two slave trades. The Atlantic slave trade was primarily motivated by economic factors, with European colonizers seeking to exploit the labor of enslaved Africans to fuel their own economic growth. In contrast, the Arab slave trade was also motivated by economic factors, but it was also influenced by cultural and social factors, such as the desire for concubines and the need for labor in the Arab world.
Next, I need to consider the demographics of the slaves taken by each trade. The Atlantic slave trade predominantly took female slaves, who were often used as domestic servants or concubines. In contrast, the Arab slave trade took a higher proportion of male slaves, who were often used as laborers or soldiers.
Finally, I need to consider the treatment of slaves in each trade. The Atlantic slave trade was notorious for its brutal treatment of slaves, with many enslaved Africans being subjected to harsh conditions, physical abuse, and forced labor. In contrast, the Arab slave trade was also known for its brutal treatment of slaves, with many enslaved Africans being subjected to physical abuse, forced labor, and other forms of mistreatment.

Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.

The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.

Which of the following factors, not mentioned in the second passage, would have been most likely to create added difficulties for native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations? Choices: a) The arrival of rival hunters from China and Japan b) The impact of epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers c) The general warming of the climate during this time period d) The reduced demand for furs among European and Asian elites 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context of the passage, which describes the difficulties faced by native Siberians in fulfilling their tribute obligations due to the lack of furbearing animals and the loss of horses.
Next, I need to evaluate the options and determine which one would have created added difficulties for native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations.
The arrival of rival hunters from China and Japan (option a) might have increased competition for furbearing animals, but it would not have created added difficulties for native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations.
The impact of epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers (option b) would have weakened the native population, making it even more difficult for them to fulfill their tribute obligations.
The general warming of the climate during this time period (option c) is not mentioned in the passage and would not have created added difficulties for native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations.
The reduced demand for furs among European and Asian elites (option d) would have reduced the incentive for native Siberians to hunt and fulfill their tribute obligations, but it would not have created added difficulties for them.

Internal troubles threatened to have a fatal effect on the further progress of this obstinate war.

The cruel enemy is making his last efforts and the moment is near when our valiant Army, in concert with our glorious Allies, will finally overthrow the enemy. In these decisive days in the life of Russia we have thought that we owed to our people the close union and organization of all its forces for the realization of a rapid victory; for which reason, in agreement with the Imperial Duma, we have recognized that it is for the good of the country that we should abdicate the Crown of the Russian State and lay down the Supreme Power.""

Choices: a) Economic prosperity that fostered dislike of the aristocracy b) Widespread dislike of Nicholas' tolerance of political dissidents c) Large-scale military losses and resentment of the working classes d) Persecution of religious minorities 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context of the declaration of abdication. The declaration is made during a time of war and internal troubles, which suggests that the situation is critical.
Next, I need to analyze the language used in the declaration. The Tsar mentions the ""great struggle against a foreign enemy"" and the need to ""conduct the war to a victorious end."" This suggests that the war is a major concern.
Now, I need to consider the options. Option a) Economic prosperity that fostered dislike of the aristocracy is unlikely, as the declaration mentions internal troubles and the need for a ""victorious end"" to the war, which suggests that the economy is not a major concern. Option b) Widespread dislike of Nicholas' tolerance of political dissidents is also unlikely, as the declaration mentions the need for a ""close union and organization of all its forces"" to achieve a ""rapid victory,"" which suggests that the Tsar is trying to rally the people, not alienate them. Option c) Large-scale military losses and resentment of the working classes is a plausible explanation, as the declaration mentions the need for a ""victorious end"" to the war and the Tsar's willingness to abdicate, which suggests that the military situation is critical and the Tsar is trying to find a way to end the war quickly. Option d) Persecution of religious minorities is not mentioned in the declaration, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer.

The Spanish colonizers did not enslave native American populations outright, as they had access to African slaves. However, the Spanish colonizers did rely heavily on native American labor, particularly in the mines.
Now, I need to analyze the options provided. Option a) is incorrect because the Spanish colonizers did not enslave native American populations outright. Option b) is also incorrect because the Spanish colonizers did purchase slaves from Africa. Option d) is incorrect because the passage does not mention plantation monoculture.

At the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated.... The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions... a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.

Treaty of Tordesillas, 1494
Which of the following historical developments provides the best context for the treaty above? Choices: a) European maritime exploration b) European engagement in the African slave trade c) The Scientific Revolution d) The Protestant Reformation 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the treaty. The treaty is about dividing the lands discovered in the ocean sea between the King of Portugal and the King of Castile, Aragon, etc.
Next, I need to consider the historical developments that could have led to such a treaty. European maritime exploration is a key development that could have led to the treaty, as it would have led to the discovery of new lands and the need to divide them.
Now, I need to evaluate the other options. The African slave trade is not directly related to the treaty, as it is not mentioned in the text. The Scientific Revolution and the Protestant Reformation are also not directly related to the treaty, as they are more focused on intellectual and religious developments rather than geographical exploration.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

While some theorists in the Middle Ages argued that the jihad was a defensive war… most authorities held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam. The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or ""Sea of Precious Virtues,"" written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.
Robert Irwin, ""Islam and the Crusades,"" 1995
It is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them. Likewise, not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories.
Ibn Jubayr, Muslim scholar, traveling to Mecca and Jerusalem, ca. 1185
The second passage undermines traditional historical assumptions by Choices: a) showing that state-level antagonisms in the Middle East during the crusading era were not always reflected in personal or economic life. b) showing how Middle Eastern Muslims during the crusading era did not take religious obligations as seriously as Christians did. c) showing how Muslims were on the whole kinder than Christians in the Middle East during the crusading era. d) showing how, in the Middle East during the crusading era, economic factors trumped all other considerations. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the content of the second passage. The passage describes how Christian merchants were treated kindly by Muslims in Muslim territories, and how Muslims and Christians interacted peacefully in the region of Mount Lebanon.
Next, I need to consider the traditional historical assumptions that the passage might be challenging. The passage suggests that state-level antagonisms between Muslims and Christians during the crusading era were not always reflected in personal or economic life.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices to see which one best matches the content of the passage. Choice a) shows that state-level antagonisms were not always reflected in personal or economic life, which aligns with the passage's description of peaceful interactions between Muslims and Christians.

""In Northern India the existence of separate States at this period is usually little more than a question of words. A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.""
W.H. Moreland, India at the Death of Akbar, 1920
Moreland's description of revenue collection in the Mughal Empire is best seen as evidence for which of the following generalizations? Choices: a) Only people of certain religions were required to pay revenue to the empire. b) Geographical differences may have influenced which groups pay taxes. c) Revenue collection was the only source of funds by which the Mughal Empire operated. d) The case of Rajputana was a typical one in the Mughal Empire. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. The passage is discussing the Mughal Empire and its revenue collection system.
Next, I need to identify the main idea of the passage. The passage is describing the complexities of revenue collection in the Mughal Empire, where some groups pay revenue, some are in open rebellion, and some enjoy practical independence.
Now, I need to analyze the options. Option a) is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about religion being a factor in revenue collection. Option c) is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about revenue collection being the only source of funds for the empire. Option d) is incorrect because the passage describes Rajputana as an example of a region with complex revenue collection, rather than a typical one.
The correct answer is option b) because the passage suggests that geographical differences may have influenced which groups pay taxes, as it mentions that the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion in certain regions.

By what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land!

Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of the passage. The passage is about the Chinese trade commissioner, Lin Zexu, expressing his concerns about the trade of opium with foreigners, specifically the British.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the passage. The passage is written in 1839, a time when the British were expanding their economic influence in China, particularly through the opium trade.
Now, I need to evaluate the options in relation to the main idea and historical context. Option a) Europe's enslavement of Chinese citizens is not relevant to the passage, as there is no mention of slavery. Option b) Europe's expansion of missionary activity in China is also not relevant, as the passage focuses on trade, not religion. Option c) Europe's economic domination of China is the most relevant option, as the passage discusses the negative impact of the opium trade on China and the commissioner's concerns about the economic influence of foreigners. Option d) Europe's colonization of Chinese territory is not the main focus of the passage, although it is related to the broader context of European economic domination.

The passage also mentions that the gold is extracted by digging pits in the kingdom.
Next, I need to analyze the options and determine which one is most supported by the passage. Option a) is not supported by the passage, as there is no mention of bronze tools. Option c) is also not supported, as the passage does not mention the jizya being collected only on unbelievers with minerals to exploit. Option d) is not supported, as the passage does not mention the kingdom's mining technologies.
Option b) is the most supported, as the passage describes the exchange of mineral resources between the kingdom of Mali and the land of the pagan Sudan. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

First, I need to identify the tone of the first verse. The verse is a warning against strong drink and games of chance and idols, and it describes them as an ""infamy of Satan's handiwork."" This suggests a tone of moral disapproval and a sense of urgency.
Next, I need to consider the options. Option a) A puritanical injunction to adhere to a strict code of conduct seems to fit the tone of the first verse, as it describes the activities as an ""infamy"" and urges the reader to ""leave it aside.""
Option b) An ecumenical call for religious tolerance does not fit the tone of the first verse, as it is a warning against specific activities rather than a call for understanding and acceptance of different beliefs.
Option c) A sermon about respecting political authority does not fit the tone of the first verse, as it is focused on moral behavior rather than political obedience.
Option d) A spirited attempt to convert non-believers does not fit the tone of the first verse, as it is a warning to believers rather than an attempt to persuade non-believers.

Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.
William Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, ""On the Suppression of Sati,"" 1829
I have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].
George Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826
Which of the following resources would the author of the second passage have been most likely interested in obtaining from local natives? Choices: a) Ivory b) Tobacco c) Silver d) Furs 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. The author is discussing the relationship between the Hudson's Bay Company and the Indians they trade with.
Next, I need to identify the key points in the passage. The author mentions that they have studied the nature and character of the Indians and are convinced that they must be ruled with a rod of iron to bring them into subordination.
Now, I need to consider what resources the author would be most interested in obtaining from the Indians. The author mentions that the most certain way to effect subordination is by letting the Indians feel their dependence on the foodstuffs and manufactured goods they sell them. This suggests that the author is interested in obtaining goods that the Indians need or want, in order to exert control over them.
Considering the options, I think the author would be most interested in obtaining furs. Furs were a valuable commodity in the 19th century, and the Hudson's Bay Company was known for its fur trade. The author's interest in obtaining goods that the Indians need or want suggests that they would be interested in obtaining furs, which the Indians would be dependent on the company for.

Next, I need to analyze the language and tone of Lenin's message. Lenin is using strong language, emphasizing the importance of seizing power and the consequences of procrastination. He is also appealing to the revolutionaries' sense of urgency and responsibility.
Now, I need to consider the philosophical underpinnings of Lenin's message. Lenin is advocating for a revolutionary seizure of power, which is a key tenet of Marxist ideology. Marxism emphasizes the need for a proletarian revolution to overthrow the capitalist class and establish a socialist society.

The following poem refers to an incident in Sharpeville, South Africa, in 1960. To protest the requirement that they carry papers documenting their identity and residence, black South Africans gathered in front of police stations without their papers. Though other protests ended peacefully, in Sharpeville, police fired into the crowd.
What is important
about Sharpeville
is not that seventy died:
nor even that they were shot in the back
retreating, unarmed, defenceless
and certainty not
the heavy caliber slug
that tore through a mother's back
and ripped through the child in her arms
killing it
Remember Sharpeville
bullet-in-the-back day
Because it epitomized oppression
and the nature of society
More clearly than anything else;
it was the classic event
Nowhere is racial dominance
more clearly defined
nowhere the will to oppress
more clearly demonstrated
What the world whispers
apartheid declares with snarling guns
the blood the rich lust after
South Africa spills dust
Remember Sharpeville
Remember bullet-in-the-back day
And remember the unquenchable will for freedom
Remember the dead
and be glad

What event symbolized the end of South Africa's institutionalized discrimination? Choices: a) The election of F. W. de Klerk b) The election of Nelson Mandela c) The bombing of Lesotho d) The Boer War 
Output:
First, I need to identify the event that symbolized the end of South Africa's institutionalized discrimination. The poem mentions Sharpeville, which refers to an incident in 1960 where police fired into a crowd of black South Africans protesting the requirement to carry papers documenting their identity and residence.
Next, I need to consider the significance of the event. The poem describes Sharpeville as the ""classic event"" that ""epitomized oppression"" and ""the nature of society"" in South Africa, highlighting the racial dominance and will to oppress.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices. The election of F. W. de Klerk (a) and Nelson Mandela (b) are significant events in South African history, but they do not symbolize the end of institutionalized discrimination. The bombing of Lesotho (c) is not a relevant event, and the Boer War (d) is a historical conflict that occurred in the late 19th century, long before the institutionalized discrimination in South Africa.

Choices: a) The Spanish desired to convert the Barbary states to Catholicism. b) The Spanish believed Portugal did not know about their discovery of the New World. c) The Spanish wanted to preserve the independence of Native states in the New World as a buffer against Portuguese expansion. d) The Spanish thought India would be harder to conquer than the New World. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the Treaty of Tordesillas. The treaty was signed in 1494 between the King of Portugal and the King and Queen of Castile and Aragon, dividing the New World between the two powers.
Next, I need to identify the reason for the Spanish insistence on control of territory west of the demarcation line. The treaty states that all lands discovered or to be discovered on the western side of the line shall belong to the King and Queen of Castile and Aragon.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) is incorrect because the treaty does not mention the conversion of the Barbary states to Catholicism. Option b) is also incorrect because the treaty does not suggest that Portugal was unaware of Spanish discoveries. Option c) is incorrect because the treaty does not mention the preservation of Native states as a buffer against Portuguese expansion.

The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means.... The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms.... He sits... in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols.... On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals.... The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists.

Based on the excerpt, which of the following statements correctly describes Islam's influence in Africa during this time period? Choices: a) Imams and muezzins ensured that all Africans adhered to Islamic law. b) Some elites converted to Islam, but lower classes kept their traditional beliefs. c) Muslim merchants refused to do business with anyone who was not Muslim. d) African kings required Muslims to conform to pagan customs at court. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key information about Islam's influence in Africa during this time period. The excerpt mentions that the king of Malal was ""sincerely attached to Islam,"" which suggests that Islam had some influence in the region.
Next, I need to consider the social dynamics of the time period. The excerpt describes the king of Ghana as a Muslim, but notes that the majority of his ministers are also Muslims. This suggests that Islam had some influence among the elite, but may not have been widely practiced among the general population.
Now, I need to evaluate the answer choices based on the information in the excerpt. Choice a) is incorrect because the excerpt does not mention imams and muezzins enforcing Islamic law. Choice c) is also incorrect because the excerpt does not mention Muslim merchants refusing to do business with non-Muslims. Choice d) is incorrect because the excerpt describes the king of Ghana as a Muslim, but does not suggest that he required Muslims to conform to pagan customs at court.

""Upon their arrival they were honorably and graciously received by the grand Khan, in a full assembly of his principal officers. When they drew nigh to his person, they paid their respects by prostrating themselves on the floor.

To their narrative, which they gave in the regular order of events, and delivered in perspicuous language, he listened with attentive silence. The letters and the presents from pope Gregory were then laid before him, and, upon hearing the former read, he bestowed much commendation on the fidelity, the zeal, and the diligence of his ambassadors; and receiving with due reverence the oil from the holy sepulchre, he gave directions that it should be preserved with religious care. Upon his observing Marco Polo, and inquiring who he was, Nicolo made answer, This is your servant, and my son; upon which the grand Khan replied, ""He is welcome, and it pleases me much,"" and he caused him to be enrolled amongst his attendants of honor. And on account of their return he made a great feast and rejoicing; and as long as the said brothers and Marco remained in the court of the grand Khan, they were honored even above his own courtiers.

Choices: a) The Mongols generally ignored or assimilated to the cultural identities of the people whom they conquered. b) The Mongols often took over territory without major destruction or bloodshed. c) The Mongols imposed their religious beliefs on the people whom they conquered. d) The Mongols had little interest in trading with their geographic neighbors. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the Mongol Empire's approach to cultural identity. The passage suggests that the Mongols were open to adopting the cultural practices of the people they conquered, as Marco Polo was able to learn and adopt the manners of the Tartars. This is in contrast to other empires, which often imposed their own cultural identity on the people they conquered.
Next, I need to consider the Mongol Empire's approach to conquest. The passage suggests that the Mongols were able to take over territory without major destruction or bloodshed, as they were received with honor and respect by the grand Khan. This is in contrast to other empires, which often engaged in violent and destructive conquests.
Now, I need to consider the Mongol Empire's approach to religion. The passage suggests that the Mongols were tolerant of different religious beliefs, as they received the oil from the holy sepulchre with reverence. This is in contrast to other empires, which often imposed their own religious beliefs on the people they conquered.
Finally, I need to consider the Mongol Empire's approach to trade. The passage suggests that the Mongols were interested in trading with their geographic neighbors, as they received presents from the pope. This is in contrast to other empires, which often had little interest in trading with their neighbors.

If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.""
Otto von Bismarck, 1884
This speech led to the creation of laws that did which of the following? Choices: a) Limited work hours in factories b) Established public health care and pensions c) Displaced citizens in the overpopulated city to the countryside d) Forced early retirement for aging workers 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main issue that Otto von Bismarck is addressing in his speech. He is talking about the insecurity of workers' existence, including the uncertainty of having work, being healthy, and being able to work when old.
Next, I need to understand the consequences of this insecurity. Bismarck mentions that if a worker falls into poverty, they are left helpless and society does not provide much support beyond general help for the poor.
Now, I need to consider the impact of Bismarck's speech on the creation of laws. Given the context, it is likely that the laws were created to address the issues of worker insecurity and poverty. The options provided suggest different possible outcomes of these laws. Option a) Limited work hours in factories is not directly related to the issues Bismarck is addressing. Option c) Displaced citizens in the overpopulated city to the countryside is also not relevant. Option d) Forced early retirement for aging workers is not mentioned in the context. Option b) Established public health care and pensions is the most likely outcome, as it directly addresses the issues of worker insecurity and poverty.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

The interactions described in the letters are best understood in the context of which of the following? Choices: a) Portuguese exploration of the coast of West Africa b) Catholic missionary efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa c) State formation in Sub-Saharan Africa d) Development of the slave trade in Sub-Saharan Africa 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the letters. The letters are written by King Afonso I of Kongo and King Manuel of Portugal, and they refer to interactions between the Kingdom of Kongo and the Portuguese.
Next, I need to identify the main issue being discussed in the letters. The letters mention the seizure of people from the Kingdom of Kongo and their sale to the Portuguese, which suggests that the issue is related to the slave trade.
Now, I need to consider the options and determine which one best fits the context of the letters. The letters do not mention exploration, missionary efforts, or state formation, but they do mention the seizure and sale of people, which is a key aspect of the slave trade.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

Instructions from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo, 1512
The two letters best support which of the following conclusions? Choices: a) Diplomatic relations between Portugal and Kongo were often cordial. b) Kongolese noblemen were frequently taken as slaves by the Portuguese. c) Trade between Portugal and Kongo was highly regulated. d) Trade between Portugal and Kongo was brisk with both parties. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the content of the two letters. The first letter from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal expresses concern about the kidnapping of Kongolese people, including noblemen, by the Portuguese. This suggests that the relationship between the two kingdoms was not always cordial.
Next, I need to examine the second letter from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo. This letter instructs the envoy to negotiate with the Kongolese to obtain goods, including slaves, copper, and ivory, to fill the ships. This implies that trade between the two kingdoms was indeed regulated, with the Portuguese seeking to extract goods from the Kongolese.
Now, I need to consider the options. Option a) is incorrect because the letters suggest that the relationship between the two kingdoms was often tense. Option b) is supported by the first letter, which mentions the kidnapping of Kongolese noblemen. Option d) is not supported by the letters, which do not provide evidence of brisk trade between the two kingdoms.

Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!
What's this that you have done?
Is 't not a very naughty thing
To snatch the kaiser's crown?
Now you will have to stay away
Alike from Rhine and Prague,
And more than that-shame and dismay
Your days and nights will plague.
Right well you knew, and all the world,
Right well they know this thing,
That Ferdinand alone can be
Bohemia's lawful king.
So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go
To Ferdinand, your king,
And beg him graciously to show
Full pardon for your sin.

Based on the song, the Winter King did which of the following? Choices: a) Gave over his crown to King Ferdinand b) Successfully defended his land from the Holy Roman Empire c) Rebelled against King Ferdinand d) Claimed the lands of Bohemia for the Catholic Church 
Output:
First, I need to identify the actions of the Winter King. The song states that the Winter King ""snatched the kaiser's crown,"" which implies that he took the crown from the Holy Roman Emperor.
Next, I need to consider the consequences of the Winter King's actions. The song states that the Winter King will have to stay away from Rhine and Prague, and that he will experience shame and dismay.
Now, I need to analyze the options. Option a) Gave over his crown to King Ferdinand is the opposite of what the song states, so it is incorrect. Option b) Successfully defended his land from the Holy Roman Empire is not mentioned in the song, so it is also incorrect. Option c) Rebelled against King Ferdinand is consistent with the song's statement that the Winter King ""snatched the kaiser's crown,"" so it is a possible answer. Option d) Claimed the lands of Bohemia for the Catholic Church is not mentioned in the song, so it is incorrect.

In the given text, it is mentioned that the Chamavi and Angrivarii tribes were driven out and exterminated by the neighboring tribes with the help of the Roman Empire. This suggests that the barbarian peoples were not treated as equals, but rather as enemies to be defeated.
Now, I need to consider the options and find the one that is similar to this treatment.
Option a) Barbarian peoples were converted to the religions of their host societies. This is not similar to the treatment described in the text, as it implies a level of acceptance and integration.
Option b) Barbarian peoples were utilized as soldiers in their host societies. This is similar to the treatment described in the text, as it implies a level of acceptance and utilization, rather than extermination.
Option c) Barbarian peoples were uniformly relegated to a servile status through the laws of their host societies. This is not similar to the treatment described in the text, as it implies a level of subjugation, rather than extermination.
Option d) Barbarian peoples were often invited by their host societies to rule instead of the societies' own ruling classes. This is not similar to the treatment described in the text, as it implies a level of acceptance and integration, rather than extermination.

""I travelled thence to 'Aden, the port of Yemen, on the coast of the ocean. It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only; it has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God.""
Ibn Battuta, ca. 1325–1354 C.E.
The views expressed in this journal passage are best seen as evidence of which of the following concerning medieval Islamic societies? Choices: a) The absence of religious orthodoxy b) Hostility toward outsiders c) Limited economic opportunities d) The supremacy of piety 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the passage to understand the views expressed by Ibn Battuta. He describes Aden as a hot and dry place with no crops, trees, or water, but with reservoirs that collect rainwater. He also mentions that the Arabs often cut off the supply of drinking-water to the inhabitants until they are paid off.
Next, I need to consider the social and economic aspects of Aden. Ibn Battuta notes that the inhabitants are either merchants, porters, or fishermen, and that some merchants are extremely rich, owning large ships and their contents. He also mentions that the merchants are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, and that they treat strangers well and give liberally to devotees.
Now, I need to evaluate the views expressed by Ibn Battuta in the context of medieval Islamic societies. The passage suggests that the merchants in Aden are wealthy and influential, but also pious and generous. This implies that piety is highly valued in medieval Islamic societies, and that it is not in conflict with economic success.

""MAHATMA GANDHI'S MESSAGE.
REMAIN NON-VIOLENT
The following message was sent by Mahatma Gandhi from Waltair:—
Maulana Mohamed AH was arrested at Waltair under sections 107 and 108 to be called upon to give security, to be of good behaviour for one year. The place and date of trial is unknown.
The Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.
He and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.
I hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.
By striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.
Let us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal.""

Which of the following historical developments from the period 1450–1750 C.E. most inspired the instructions indicated in the fifth paragraph to boycott foreign cloth? Choices: a) The conquest of India by rival Muslim empires b) The development of joint-stock companies c) The importation of food crops from the New World d) The African slave trade 
Output:
First, I need to identify the historical development that inspired the instructions to boycott foreign cloth. The instructions were given by Mahatma Gandhi in 1921.
Next, I need to consider the historical developments from the period 1450–1750 C.E. that could have inspired Gandhi's instructions. The conquest of India by rival Muslim empires (a) and the importation of food crops from the New World (c) are not directly related to the boycott of foreign cloth.
The development of joint-stock companies (b) is a possible inspiration, as it led to the establishment of the British East India Company, which played a significant role in the colonization of India and the introduction of foreign goods, including cloth.
The African slave trade (d) is not directly related to the boycott of foreign cloth.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]….The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year….
And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.
And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines….And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]…at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.
There is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him….Even the protector of the Indians is useless;…he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.""

Questions to the passage below, an account given to a French officer in Algeria in the 1830s by a member of an Arab slave trade caravan.
The Slave Trade
All of you [soldiers], are summoned... to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""].... The soldiery divided themselves into two companies... with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields.... Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries
A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women.... It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own.... Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk.... They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.
Which conclusion is supported by the passage? Choices: a) Africans passively accepted their capture and subsequent enslavement. b) North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes. c) Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women. d) Adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the information given in the passage. The passage describes the account of a member of an Arab slave trade caravan in Algeria in the 1830s.
Next, I need to identify the key points mentioned in the passage. The passage mentions the prices of different types of slaves, the composition of the caravan, and the behavior of the slaves when they were captured.
Now, I need to evaluate the options based on the information given in the passage. The passage does not mention anything about Africans passively accepting their capture and subsequent enslavement (option a). It also does not mention anything about North Africans being primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes (option b). The passage does mention that the caravan was augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women, but it does not provide any information about population changes resulting from slavery (option c). Finally, the passage mentions that a male Negro child was valued at 45,000 cowries, which is lower than the value of a young Negress (50-60,000 cowries), so it is not supported by the passage that adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength (option d).

"Input: This question refers to the following information.
Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!
What's this that you have done?
Is 't not a very naughty thing
To snatch the kaiser's crown?
Now you will have to stay away
Alike from Rhine and Prague,
And more than that-shame and dismay
Your days and nights will plague.
Right well you knew, and all the world,
Right well they know this thing,
That Ferdinand alone can be
Bohemia's lawful king.
So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go
To Ferdinand, your king,
And beg him graciously to show
Full pardon for your sin.
""Poor Winter King,"" seventeenth-century song
Which of the following best explains why the narrator mentions ""Rhine and Prague""? Choices: a) They are destinations for the Winter King's planned pilgrimage. b) These are lands that the Winter King lost in battle. c) Because these were strongholds of the Holy Roman Empire, the narrator warns the Winter King to stay away. d) They are significant military posts within the borders of the Holy Roman Empire. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the song. The song is about the Winter King, who has committed a ""naughty thing"" by snatching the kaiser's crown. The narrator is warning the Winter King of the consequences of his actions.
Next, I need to analyze the specific line that mentions ""Rhine and Prague"". The narrator says ""Now you will have to stay away / Alike from Rhine and Prague"". This suggests that the Winter King is being punished by being forced to stay away from these places.
Now, I need to consider the historical context of the Rhine and Prague. The Rhine is a river that runs through the heart of the Holy Roman Empire, and Prague is the capital of Bohemia, a region within the empire. The narrator is likely warning the Winter King to stay away from these places because they are strongholds of the empire, and the Winter King's actions have put him at odds with the empire.

Which of the following would most undermine the expectations expressed in Article 1 of Source 1? Choices: a) Intervention by the United States and European powers in the independence of Latin American countries b) Nationalism in Latin America pressing for stronger unity between the former Spanish colonies of South America c) Slave rebellions fragmenting newly independent Latin American states d) Sectionalism of elites in the various territories of newly independent Latin American states 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the question. The question refers to the Fundamental Law Establishing Gran Colombia, which united the provinces of Venezuela and the New Granada under a single republic.
Next, I need to analyze the expectations expressed in Article 1 of Source 1. The article states that the provinces of Venezuela and the New Granada have voluntarily stood by the Sovereign Congress of Venezuela and that they have united in a single Republic to elevate themselves to a higher grade of power and prosperity.
Now, I need to consider the options and determine which one would most undermine the expectations expressed in Article 1. Option a) Intervention by the United States and European powers in the independence of Latin American countries would undermine the expectations expressed in Article 1 because it would imply that the provinces of Venezuela and the New Granada did not have the ability to voluntarily stand by the Sovereign Congress of Venezuela and unite in a single Republic.
Option b) Nationalism in Latin America pressing for stronger unity between the former Spanish colonies of South America would actually support the expectations expressed in Article 1, as it would imply that the provinces of Venezuela and the New Granada are working towards a stronger unity.
Option c) Slave rebellions fragmenting newly independent Latin American states would not directly undermine the expectations expressed in Article 1, as the article does not mention anything about slavery or the social structure of the provinces.
Option d) Sectionalism of elites in the various territories of newly independent Latin American states would not directly undermine the expectations expressed in Article 1, as the article does not mention anything about the social structure of the provinces.

The knowledge of anything, since all things have causes, is not acquired or complete unless it is known by its causes. Therefore in medicine we ought to know the causes of sickness and health. And because health and sickness and their causes are sometimes manifest, and sometimes hidden and not to be comprehended except by the study of symptoms, we must also study the symptoms of health and disease. Now it is established in the sciences that no knowledge is acquired save through the study of its causes and beginnings, if it has had causes and beginnings; nor completed except by knowledge of its accidents and accompanying essentials.""

Output:
First, I need to identify the authors of the two passages. The first passage is written by Paul of Aegina, and the second passage is written by Ibn Sina (Avicenna).
Next, I need to consider the historical context of the authors. Paul of Aegina lived in the late seventh century C.E. and wrote in Greek, while Ibn Sina lived in the eleventh century C.E. and wrote in Arabic.
Now, I need to consider the cultural exchange that occurred in the period 600–1450 C.E. The passage by Paul of Aegina is written in Greek, and the passage by Ibn Sina is written in Arabic. This suggests that the Greek science was transmitted to the Islamic world through the Byzantines.

Output:
First, I need to identify the key elements of the poem. The poem is written in a style that is reminiscent of jazz and blues, with references to African American culture and the city of New York. The language is rich and expressive, with vivid imagery and metaphors.
Next, I need to consider the historical context in which the poem was written. The poem was written in 1956 by a Senegalese poet, Léopold Sédar Senghor. This was a time of great cultural and artistic innovation, particularly in the African diaspora.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) refers to the avant-garde literary styles of the early 20th century, which is not relevant to this poem. Option c) refers to the use of art and literature for political purposes, which is not the primary focus of this poem. Option d) refers to the response of interwar literary figures to the horrors of World War I, which is not relevant to this poem.
The poem is best seen as an example of option b) The adaptation of Western literary forms by non-Western authors. The poem is written in a style that is influenced by Western literary forms, but it is also deeply rooted in African culture and experience. The poem is a powerful example of the ways in which non-Western authors have adapted and transformed Western literary forms to create new and innovative works of art.

By what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land!

Output:
First, I need to identify the main issue described in the passage. The main issue is that the Chinese are exporting opium to Europe, which is harmful to mankind.
Next, I need to consider the possible reasons why Europeans would engage in such actions. The passage suggests that the Europeans are motivated by a desire for gain.
Now, I need to evaluate the options in light of this information. Option a) is not mentioned in the passage, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer. Option b) is also not mentioned in the passage, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer. Option d) is not mentioned in the passage, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer.

""To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten!

She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak.

Choices: a) Persian efforts to convert people away from Buddhism inspired further followers. b) Buddhism's apocalyptic message swayed converts in Persia. c) Persia's location sat astride international trade routes with India. d) Buddhists were granted limited toleration by Zoroastrians. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the historical context of the Sassanid Empire. The Sassanid Empire was a Zoroastrian empire, and Zoroastrianism was the official religion.
Next, I need to consider the presence of Buddhist communities within the empire. The text mentions the presence of Buddhists, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, Nasoreans, Christians, Maktak, and Manichaeans in the empire.
Now, I need to consider the relationship between the Sassanid Empire and Buddhism. The text does not mention any efforts by the Persians to convert people away from Buddhism, nor does it mention any apocalyptic message of Buddhism that swayed converts in Persia.
Therefore, the most plausible explanation for the presence of Buddhist communities within Sassanid Persia is that Persia's location sat astride international trade routes with India, which would have facilitated the spread of Buddhism into the empire.

Choices: a) The invention of the machine gun b) The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases c) The development of the joint-stock company d) The invention of steam-powered ships 
Output:
First, I need to consider the historical context of European penetration of Africa during the period 1750 to 1900 C.E. During this time, European powers were expanding their empires and establishing colonies in Africa.
Next, I need to evaluate the options and determine which one contributed the LEAST to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa.
The invention of the machine gun (option a) was a significant factor in European conquest of Africa, as it allowed European armies to overpower African resistance.
The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases (option b) was also a significant factor, as it allowed European colonizers to establish themselves in Africa without being decimated by diseases such as malaria and yellow fever.
The development of the joint-stock company (option c) was a key factor in European penetration of Africa, as it allowed investors to pool their resources and finance large-scale colonial ventures.
The invention of steam-powered ships (option d) was a significant factor in European expansion, as it allowed for faster and more efficient transportation of goods and people across the Atlantic.
However, the invention of vaccines for tropical diseases (option b) contributed the LEAST to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa, as it was not a primary factor in European conquest and colonization.

Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of the speech. The main idea is that Africa should unite to avoid disunity and to project the African personality to the world.
Next, I need to analyze the information given in the speech. The speech mentions the French atomic tests in the Sahara and the U.N. quibbling about constitutional niceties in the Congo. This suggests that the French and the U.N. do not take African independence seriously.
Now, I need to consider the options given. Option a) A collection of republics tottering into anarchy is mentioned in the speech as a description of the Congo, but it is not a description of how the French saw Africa. Option b) A resource for enhancing French power in the Cold War is a plausible interpretation of the French actions in the Sahara, as the French were conducting atomic tests there. Option c) Important due to the Sahara's natural resources is also a plausible interpretation, as the Sahara is a region with significant natural resources. Option d) A strong political union is not mentioned in the speech as a description of how the French saw Africa.

Marco Polo was a Venetian merchant who traveled to China and observed the Mongol Empire. Lorenzo de Medici was a Florentine merchant and banker who traveled extensively throughout Europe. Xuanzang was a Chinese Buddhist monk who traveled to India and observed the local culture and Buddhism.
Now, I need to compare the experiences of Ibn Battuta with the other options. While all of them were travelers and observers, Ibn Battuta's experiences were LEAST similar to those of Lorenzo de Medici, who was primarily a European merchant and banker, and did not travel to the Middle East or Asia.

""Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighboring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations does not make us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our chief safeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws, particularly such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they are actually on the statute book, or belong to that code which, although unwritten, yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace.""
Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, ca. 415 B.C.E.
Which of the following correctly describes one of the primary reasons that Greek culture was disseminated widely around the Mediterranean region during the time period represented by the passage? Choices: a) The geography of Greece contains many natural resources that facilitated a profitable mining industry. b) The geography of Greece contains numerous freshwater lakes that facilitated a successful fishing industry. c) The geography of Greece contains prominent river valleys that facilitated widespread agriculture. d) The geography of Greece contains many natural harbors that facilitated trade and commerce. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the geographical features of Greece that would facilitate the dissemination of Greek culture. The passage does not mention the geography of Greece, so I need to consider the geographical features that are commonly associated with Greece.
Next, I need to consider the geographical features that would facilitate trade and commerce. Greece is known for its many natural harbors, which would have facilitated trade and commerce with other regions of the Mediterranean.
Now, I need to consider how the dissemination of Greek culture would have been facilitated by the geographical features of Greece. The natural harbors would have allowed for the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultures with other regions of the Mediterranean, facilitating the dissemination of Greek culture.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

""Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.""
Nicolo Machiavelli, The Prince, ca. 1513 C.E.
Machiavelli's treatise is best understood in the context of which of the following? Choices: a) A time of burgeoning economic prosperity among the lower classes of Italian society b) A time of increasing religious devotion among the elite Italian scholars c) A time of intense political conflict among warring Italian city-states and other factions d) A time of collegial cooperation between scholars and ecclesiastical authorities in Italy 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context in which Machiavelli wrote The Prince. The treatise is a guide for rulers, and it discusses the nature of power and how to maintain it.
Next, I need to consider the historical period in which Machiavelli lived. He was an Italian statesman and philosopher who lived during the Renaissance, a time of great change and upheaval in Italy.
The Renaissance was marked by intense political conflict among the warring Italian city-states and other factions. This conflict created a power vacuum that allowed for the rise of powerful leaders, but it also made it difficult for them to maintain their power.
Given this context, I believe that Machiavelli's treatise is best understood in the context of intense political conflict among warring Italian city-states and other factions.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

The passage below is the Chinese emperor's response to English King George III's diplomatic envoys, who were seeking expanded trading privileges (1793).
Strange and costly objects do not interest me. If I have commanded that the tribute offerings sent by you, O King, are to be accepted, this was solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar.... As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures. It behooves you, O King, to display even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity.
How did the Chinese restrict foreign trade during the era 1750–1900? Choices: a) European merchants were confined to a few cities designated for foreign trade. b) Only the Dutch traded with China; other Europeans had to use them as intermediaries. c) The Chinese imposed extraordinary tariffs on all foreign products. d) They passed laws intended to persecute and harass foreign residents. 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the passage. The Chinese emperor is responding to English King George III's diplomatic envoys, who were seeking expanded trading privileges.
Next, I need to identify the key restriction mentioned in the passage. The emperor states that he has no use for the English country's manufactures, implying that he is not interested in trading with them.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) European merchants were confined to a few cities designated for foreign trade. This is a plausible restriction, but it is not mentioned in the passage. Option b) Only the Dutch traded with China; other Europeans had to use them as intermediaries. This is not mentioned in the passage either. Option c) The Chinese imposed extraordinary tariffs on all foreign products. This is not mentioned in the passage. Option d) They passed laws intended to persecute and harass foreign residents. This is not mentioned in the passage either.
However, the passage does imply that the Chinese emperor is not interested in trading with the English, and that he values loyalty and submission over trade. This suggests that the Chinese may have restricted foreign trade in some way, but the specific restriction is not mentioned in the passage.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

Woman, wake up; the bell of reason is being heard throughout the whole universe; discover your rights. Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!
Olympe de Gouges, ""Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,"" 1791
The independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fear—but apart from that, nothing has changed.
Halima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence
Based on both passages, which of the following conclusions can be most reasonably made about revolutions? Choices: a) The new liberties gained by revolution are rarely worth the bloodshed. b) The new liberties gained by revolution typically fail to benefit women or ethnic minorities. c) The new liberties gained by revolution are sometimes distributed unequally or inconsistently. d) The new liberties gained by revolution do not always bring about economic improvement. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the two passages to understand the context and the perspectives of the authors. Olympe de Gouges, a French woman, wrote the ""Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen"" in 1791, during the French Revolution. She emphasizes the need for women to be aware of their rights and to stand up against the injustices they face. She argues that the Revolution has not brought about the desired changes for women, and that they continue to be treated with scorn and disdain.
Next, I need to consider the perspective of Halima Ghomri, an Algerian woman who was interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence. She expresses her disappointment with the outcome of the Revolution, stating that nothing has changed for her and her family. They are still poor peasants, and their children did not receive an education.
Now, I need to consider the common thread between the two passages. Both authors express disappointment and frustration with the outcome of the Revolution. Olympe de Gouges argues that the Revolution has not brought about the desired changes for women, while Halima Ghomri states that the Revolution has not improved her economic situation. This suggests that the new liberties gained by revolution may not always benefit all members of society, particularly women and ethnic minorities.

That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.""

Crosby's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450–1750 C.E.? Choices: a) The development of direct trade links between Western Europe and India b) The beginning of the Industrial Revolution c) The colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans d) The increasing development of seafaring technologies 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context of the passage. The passage mentions the idea of a society making a ""quantum jump"" in productivity and exploiting the resources of other continents to achieve global hegemony.
Next, I need to think about the historical period mentioned in the passage, which is 1450–1750 C.E. This period is often associated with the Age of Exploration and the colonization of the Americas.
Now, I need to consider the options provided and think about which one is most closely related to the idea of colonization and the exploitation of resources. Option c) The colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans is the most likely answer, as it is the event that would have required a significant increase in productivity and the exploitation of the resources of the Americas.

Output:
First, I need to identify the main idea of the passage. The author is discussing the question of whether it is better to be loved or feared by one's subjects.
Next, I need to analyze the author's tone. The author presents a pessimistic view of human nature, stating that people are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, and covetous.
The author also argues that it is safer to be feared than loved, as people are more likely to turn against a ruler who is beloved when they perceive a threat to their own interests.

Output:
First, I need to analyze the information provided in Source 2, which is the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, passed in 1824.
The Constitution states that the Catholic Apostolic Roman Religion will continue to be the religion of the Empire (Article 5).
However, it also allows followers of other religions to worship within their households or particular houses for that intent, as long as there is nothing indicating this on the exterior of the Temple (Article 5).
This suggests that while the official religion of the Empire is Catholicism, there is also a degree of religious toleration.
Now, I need to consider the other options.
Option a) Religious uniformity was expected of the citizens of most states in the period. This is not supported by Source 2, as it allows for religious toleration.
Option c) Religious authority was the basis of the divine right of monarchs to rule their states in the period. This is not supported by Source 2, as it does not mention the divine right of monarchs.
Option d) Religious influence on the populations of states declined due to scientific advancements. This is not supported by Source 2, as it does not mention scientific advancements.

Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.

First, I need to identify the context of the passages. The passages mention the British Empire in India and the practice of sati, which is a Hindu funeral rite in which a widow is burned alive with her deceased husband's body.
Next, I need to understand the tone and content of the passages. The passages are written by British officials and express their views on the practice of sati and how to deal with the Indians in India.
Now, I need to consider the options and determine which one is most relevant to the context and content of the passages. The passages are about the exercise of colonial administrative power over native peoples, specifically the British Empire's power over India and the Indians.

Next, I need to consider the context in which these elements are being introduced. The quote mentions that a Spanish nobleman can require his Indians to furnish his table with the fruits of his ancestors. This implies that the elements are being introduced to the Americas by European colonizers.
Now, I need to consider the historical processes that involved the transfer of plants, animals, and other organisms between the Old and New Worlds. The Columbian Exchange is the process by which European colonizers introduced Eurasian and African species to the Americas, and vice versa. This process had a profound impact on the ecosystems and cultures of both the Old and New Worlds.

Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China
In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
What traditional view of world history does this passage seem to challenge? Choices: a) That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies b) That China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation c) That China was hindered by religious fundamentalism when it came to modernizing efforts d) That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change 
Output:
First, I need to identify the traditional view of world history that the passage seems to challenge. The passage mentions that China devoted its efforts to improving horse archer units, which suggests that China was not focused on gunpowder weapons.
Next, I need to consider the reasons why China might not have focused on gunpowder weapons. The passage mentions that China was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, which suggests that the traditional view of China's technological inferiority might be challenged.
Finally, I need to evaluate the options and choose the one that best fits the passage. Option d) seems to fit the passage, as it suggests that China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change.

—No, it will not keep it as it should do.
Why do you allow your children to go to work at those places where they are ill-treated or over-worked?
—Necessity compels a man that has children to let them work.
Then you would not allow your children to go to those factories under the present system, if it was not from necessity?

—Testimony given before the Sadler Committee, 1831–32
Which type of organization was partially responsible for improving the hours, wages, and working conditions of workers in this era? Choices: a) Guilds b) Joint-stock companies c) Labor unions d) Zaibatsu groups 
Output:
First, I need to identify the context of the testimony. The testimony is given before the Sadler Committee, which suggests that the committee is investigating working conditions and labor practices.
Next, I need to understand the purpose of the Sadler Committee. The committee is likely investigating the treatment of workers, particularly children, in factories.
Now, I need to consider the options. Guilds were organizations of skilled craftsmen that regulated their own trades, but they were not typically involved in improving working conditions. Joint-stock companies were business organizations that raised capital by issuing shares, but they were not typically involved in improving working conditions. Zaibatsu groups were large business conglomerates in Japan, but they were not relevant to the context of the testimony. Labor unions, on the other hand, were organizations of workers that advocated for better wages, working conditions, and hours.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

The passage below is the Chinese emperor's response to English King George III's diplomatic envoys, who were seeking expanded trading privileges (1793).
Strange and costly objects do not interest me. If I have commanded that the tribute offerings sent by you, O King, are to be accepted, this was solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar.... As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures. It behooves you, O King, to display even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity.

The invaders had brought in wheat and other Eurasian and African grains; peach, pear, orange, and lemon trees; chick-peas, grape vines, melons, onions, radishes, and much more. A Spanish nobleman come to America could require his Indians to furnish his table with the fruits of his ancestors.
—Alfred Crosby, historian, 1972
What was the impact of this process on Europe? Choices: a) The population increased due to the increased diversity of crops. b) The population declined as a result of imported disease. c) The population increased due to New World immigrants. d) The population declined because of famine caused by the mass export of crops. 
Output:
First, I need to consider the impact of the process on Europe. The process refers to the Columbian Exchange, where the New World and the Old World exchanged crops and animals.
Next, I need to think about the effects of the Columbian Exchange on Europe. The exchange brought new crops and animals to Europe, which would likely increase the diversity of crops and food sources available to Europeans.
Now, I need to consider the potential impact on population. With more diverse and abundant food sources, it is likely that the population would increase, as people would have access to more food and resources.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
The city of Ghana consists of two towns. One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables.... The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means.... The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms.... He sits... in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols.... On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals.... The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani.
