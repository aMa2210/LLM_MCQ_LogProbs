Choices: a) Presenteeism b) Absenteeism c) Work-play balance d) Work-life balance 
Output:
First, I need to understand the concept of the preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities. This ratio is often referred to as the balance between work and personal life.
Next, I need to consider the impact of intensification of work and technological shifts on this balance. With the increasing demands of work and the constant availability of technology, employees are often expected to be available 24/7, leading to a blurring of the lines between work and personal life.
Now, I need to evaluate the options to determine which one best describes the preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities. 
Absenteeism (b) refers to the act of being absent from work, which is not related to the preferred ratio between work and personal life.

Output:
First, I need to understand the characteristics of a corporation. A corporation is a legal entity that is separate from its managers, employees, investors, and customers. This means that it has its own identity and is not the same as its stakeholders.
Next, I need to consider the concept of succession. A corporation has limited succession, meaning that it can continue to exist even if its managers or employees change. This is because the corporation's assets and liabilities are not tied to the individuals who work for it.
Finally, I need to think about the ownership of assets. A corporation is a separate legal entity that owns its own assets, which means that it has control over its own property and can make decisions about how to use it.

"Input: _______ locate morality beyond the sphere of rationality in an emotional'moral impulse' towards others. Choices: a) Virtue ethics b) Ethical egoism c) Postmodern ethics d) Ethics of duty 
Output:
First, I need to understand the concept of locating morality beyond the sphere of rationality. This means that morality is not solely based on reason or logic, but also on emotions and personal feelings.
Next, I need to consider the options provided. Virtue ethics (a) focuses on the development of good character traits, but it is still based on rationality and reason. Ethical egoism (b) prioritizes individual self-interest, which is not necessarily an emotional or moral impulse towards others. Postmodern ethics (c) emphasizes the importance of emotions and personal experiences in shaping moral values, which aligns with the concept of locating morality beyond rationality.
Finally, I need to evaluate the options and choose the one that best fits the description. Postmodern ethics (c) is the correct answer because it acknowledges the role of emotions and personal experiences in shaping moral values, which is in line with the idea of a moral impulse towards others.

"Input: Under ethical ________ objective moral principles can be rationally determined, while ethical under ________ morality is both context dependant and subjective. Choices: a) Normativity, Relativism b) Absolutism, Relativism c) Relativism, Absolutism d) Absolutism, Normativity 
Output:
First, I need to understand the definitions of the terms. Ethical absolutism is the view that certain actions are always right or always wrong, regardless of the context. Ethical relativism is the view that moral judgments are relative to the cultural, historical, or personal context.
Next, I need to analyze the relationship between the two terms. If ethical absolutism is the correct answer, then objective moral principles can be rationally determined, which means that moral judgments are not relative to the context. On the other hand, if ethical relativism is the correct answer, then moral judgments are relative to the context, which means that objective moral principles cannot be rationally determined.
Now, I need to consider the relationship between normativity and the two terms. Normativity refers to the idea that certain actions are considered right or wrong based on a set of rules or principles. If ethical absolutism is the correct answer, then normativity is related to the objective moral principles that can be rationally determined. If ethical relativism is the correct answer, then normativity is related to the context-dependent moral judgments.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

Output:
First, I need to consider the nature of ethics and the law. Ethics refers to a set of moral principles and values that guide human behavior, while the law refers to a set of rules and regulations that are enforced by a governing body.
Next, I need to examine the relationship between ethics and the law. While there may be some overlap between the two, they are not equivalent. The law is often based on a set of rules and regulations that are designed to maintain social order and protect individual rights, whereas ethics is concerned with the moral principles that guide human behavior.
Now, I need to consider the extent to which ethics and the law overlap. While there may be some instances where what is ethical is also what is legal, and vice versa, there are also instances where the two diverge. For example, a person may be legally entitled to do something that is not morally justifiable, or a person may be morally obligated to do something that is not legally required.
