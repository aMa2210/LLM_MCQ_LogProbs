"Input: A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation? Choices: a) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization b) Complication of the IVC filter placement c) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve d) Hematoma of the left thigh 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's history and symptoms. The patient had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She also had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage and underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago.
The patient is now experiencing a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh, which she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away. The sensation has improved somewhat during the past week.
The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal, but sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh.
Considering the patient's symptoms and history, I need to evaluate the possible causes of the decreased sensation. The patient's cerebral function is not likely to be affected, as her vital signs are within normal limits and muscle strength is normal. Therefore, option a) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization is unlikely.
The patient underwent placement of an IVC filter, but there is no indication that this procedure caused the decreased sensation. Therefore, option b) Complication of the IVC filter placement is unlikely.
The patient had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago, but the hematoma is no longer present, and the decreased sensation is localized to a specific area on the left thigh. Therefore, option d) Hematoma of the left thigh is unlikely.
The most likely cause of the decreased sensation is compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, which is a common cause of meralgia paresthetica. This condition is characterized by numbness, tingling, and burning sensations in the lateral aspect of the thigh. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with this diagnosis.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 25-year-old gravida 3 para 2 female is admitted to the hospital at 39 weeks' gestation in active labor. She had been having regular contractions every 4 minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6 hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated. The most likely diagnosis is Choices: a) Braxton Hicks contractions b) lower uterine retraction ring c) hypotonic uterine dysfunction d) primary dysfunctional labor 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key characteristics of the patient's condition. The patient is in active labor, but is having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. This suggests that the labor is not progressing as expected.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of this situation. The patient has received medication for pain twice in the past 6 hours, which may be contributing to the slowing of labor.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Braxton Hicks contractions are false labor pains that are typically irregular and unpredictable, which does not match the patient's symptoms. A lower uterine retraction ring is a condition where the uterus is unable to contract properly, but this is typically associated with a more severe and prolonged labor. Primary dysfunctional labor is a condition where the labor is slow or arrested due to a problem with the uterine contractions, which matches the patient's symptoms.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of a low-grade fever, cough, and runny nose. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo (p=0.04). Which of the following is the most appropriate interpretation of these study results? Choices: a) The findings are clinically and statistically significant b) The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant c) The findings are clinically significant but statistically insignificant d) The findings are neither clinically nor statistically significant 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the problem. The physician is referring to a clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for treating the common cold.
Next, I need to analyze the results of the trial. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo. The p-value is 0.04, which indicates that the difference between the two groups is statistically significant.
However, the difference in mean time (0.3 days) may not be clinically significant, as it is unlikely to have a major impact on the patient's quality of life or outcome.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 9-year-old boy is brought to the office by his parents for a well-child examination. The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2 months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years. He has been generally healthy. Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3 years. He takes no medications. He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI. Vital signs are temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay. Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications? Choices: a) Atrial fibrillation b) Cor pulmonale c) Systemic hypertension d) Tricuspid valve regurgitation 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's condition based on the symptoms and test results. The patient has a grade 3/6 systolic murmur, weak femoral pulses, and strong brachial pulses, which suggests aortic stenosis. The chest x-ray shows mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence, and the ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy, which is consistent with aortic stenosis.
Next, I need to consider the potential complications of aortic stenosis. Atrial fibrillation is a potential complication of many cardiac conditions, but it is not the most likely complication in this case. Cor pulmonale is a complication of pulmonary disease, which is not indicated in this case. Systemic hypertension is a common condition, but it is not directly related to aortic stenosis. Tricuspid valve regurgitation is a potential complication of aortic stenosis, as the increased pressure in the left ventricle can lead to regurgitation of blood into the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of numbness in her right hand. During this period, she has had tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger. The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of which of the following on the right? Choices: a) Median nerve at the wrist b) Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm c) Radial nerve at the forearm d) Ulnar nerve at the elbow 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms described in the case. The patient has numbness and tingling in the right ring and small fingers, which suggests a problem with the nerve that supplies these areas.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these symptoms. The patient has a history of playing softball, which may have caused repetitive strain on the nerves in her arm.
Now, I need to consider the anatomy of the nerves in the arm. The ulnar nerve runs down the arm and passes through the elbow, where it can be compressed or irritated. This compression can cause numbness and tingling in the ring and small fingers.
The patient's symptoms and history are consistent with ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow. The examination findings, including the jolt of pain in the right ring and small fingers when the elbow is palpated, support this diagnosis.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Six healthy subjects participate in a study of muscle metabolism during which hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia is induced. Muscle biopsy specimens obtained from the subjects during the resting state show significantly increased concentrations of malonyl-CoA. The increased malonyl-CoA concentration most likely directly inhibits which of the following processes in these subjects? Choices: a) Fatty acid oxidation b) Fatty acid synthesis c) Gluconeogenesis d) Glycogenolysis 
Output:
First, I need to understand the role of malonyl-CoA in muscle metabolism. Malonyl-CoA is a key regulator of fatty acid metabolism.
Next, I need to consider how malonyl-CoA affects fatty acid oxidation. Malonyl-CoA is known to inhibit the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), which is a key enzyme in the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for oxidation.
Therefore, the increased malonyl-CoA concentration most likely directly inhibits fatty acid oxidation.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 72-year-old woman with advanced ovarian cancer metastatic to the liver is brought to the physician by her son because she cries all the time and will not get out of bed. On a 10-point scale, she rates the pain as a 1 to 2. She also has hypertension and major depressive disorder. She has received chemotherapy for 2 years. Current medications also include oxycodone (10 mg twice daily), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/d), and fluoxetine (20 mg/d). She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 66 kg (145 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m2. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. Examination shows a firm, distended abdomen with moderate tenderness over the liver. On mental status examination, she is oriented to person, place, and time. She has good eye contact but appears sad and cries easily. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Choices: a) Reassurance b) Assess for suicidal ideation c) Begin dextroamphetamine therapy d) Increase oxycodone dosage 
Output:
First, I need to assess the patient's mental status and overall condition. The patient is a 72-year-old woman with advanced ovarian cancer, which is a terminal illness. She has been receiving chemotherapy for 2 years and is currently taking several medications, including oxycodone for pain management.
The patient's pain is rated as a 1 to 2 on a 10-point scale, which is relatively mild. However, she is exhibiting symptoms of depression, such as crying easily and appearing sad. She is also oriented to person, place, and time, but has good eye contact, which suggests that she is not disoriented or confused.
The patient's physical examination shows a firm, distended abdomen with moderate tenderness over the liver, which is consistent with her cancer diagnosis. Her vital signs are within normal limits, and her BMI is 24 kg/m2, which is within the normal range.
Given the patient's terminal illness and symptoms of depression, the most appropriate next step in management is to assess for suicidal ideation. This is because patients with terminal illnesses are at increased risk of suicide, and it is essential to identify any suicidal thoughts or behaviors early on.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 65-year-old woman has a 6-month history of progressive irritability, palpitations, heat intolerance, frequent bowel movements, and a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss. She has had a neck mass for more than 10 years. 131I scan shows an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple areas of increased and decreased uptake. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Choices: a) Defect in thyroxine (T4) biosynthesis b) Graves' disease c) Multinodular goiter d) Riedel's thyroiditis 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms presented by the woman. She has progressive irritability, palpitations, heat intolerance, frequent bowel movements, and a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss. These symptoms are suggestive of hyperthyroidism.
Next, I need to consider the patient's history of a neck mass for more than 10 years. This suggests that the thyroid gland has been enlarged for a long time.
The 131I scan shows an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple areas of increased and decreased uptake. This suggests that the thyroid gland is not functioning normally.
Considering the symptoms and the scan results, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) Defect in thyroxine (T4) biosynthesis is unlikely because the symptoms suggest hyperthyroidism, not hypothyroidism. Option c) Multinodular goiter is unlikely because the scan results show multiple areas of increased and decreased uptake, which is not typical of a multinodular goiter. Option d) Riedel's thyroiditis is unlikely because it is a rare condition that typically presents with a hard, fixed thyroid gland, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Graves' disease, which is a common cause of hyperthyroidism and is characterized by an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple areas of increased uptake on a 131I scan. {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 51-year-old man comes to the office because of a 6-month history of a lump on his tongue that is interfering with his speech and eating; he also has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss during this period. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily and has consumed six 12-oz bottles of beer on weekend nights during the past 30 years. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a 1.5-cm mass on the apex of the tongue. Further evaluation of the mass confirms squamous cell carcinoma. It is most appropriate to evaluate which of the following lymph nodes first for evidence of metastasis in this patient? Choices: a) Inferior deep cervical b) Parotid c) Retropharyngeal d) Submental 
Output:
First, I need to identify the location of the tumor. The tumor is located on the apex of the tongue.
Next, I need to determine which lymph nodes are most likely to be involved first. The lymphatic drainage of the tongue is primarily to the submental and submandibular lymph nodes, but the submental lymph nodes are the first echelon nodes for the apex of the tongue.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 42-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination 1 week after he passed a renal calculus. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the calculus showed calcium as the primary cation. Physical examination today shows no abnormalities. A 24-hour collection of urine shows increased calcium excretion. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? Choices: a) Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor b) Na+ –Cl− symport inhibitor c) Na+ –K + –2Cl− symport inhibitor d) Osmotic diuretic 
Output:
First, I need to identify the type of kidney stone the man has. The X-ray crystallographic analysis showed that the primary cation is calcium, which means the man has a calcium stone.
Next, I need to understand the underlying cause of the increased calcium excretion. The increased calcium excretion is likely due to hypercalciuria, which is a condition where the kidneys excrete too much calcium in the urine.
Now, I need to consider the treatment options. The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of calcium in the urine and prevent the formation of new stones.
A carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (choice a) would increase the excretion of calcium in the urine, which is not what we want.
A Na+ –Cl− symport inhibitor (choice b) is not typically used to treat hypercalciuria.
A Na+ –K + –2Cl− symport inhibitor (choice c) is a type of diuretic that can help reduce the amount of calcium in the urine by increasing the excretion of calcium and reducing the reabsorption of calcium in the kidneys.
An osmotic diuretic (choice d) would not be effective in reducing the amount of calcium in the urine.
Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is a Na+ –K + –2Cl− symport inhibitor, which is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: While you are on rounds at a local nursing facility, the nurse mentions that your patient, a 79-year-old woman, appears to be a ""poor eater."" She was admitted to the nursing facility 3 months ago from the hospital where she was treated for congestive heart failure. Her daughter had moved away from the area, and nursing home placement was necessary because the patient could no longer function independently. Her present medications include furosemide and digoxin. Physical examination is normal except for a weight loss of 3.5 kg (7 lb) during the past 3 months. In your conversation with the patient, she says, ""No, I'm not depressed, I just don't have an appetite anymore. Nothing tastes good to me. I have a little bit of nausea most of the time."" Which of the following is the most appropriate initial diagnostic study? Choices: a) Chest x-ray b) Complete blood count c) Determination of serum albumin concentration d) Determination of serum digoxin level 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient has been experiencing weight loss, nausea, and a lack of appetite, which are common symptoms of anorexia of aging.
Next, I need to consider the patient's medications and medical history. The patient is taking furosemide and digoxin, which can cause nausea and vomiting as side effects.
However, the patient's symptoms and medical history suggest that the anorexia of aging is more likely the cause of her symptoms than her medications.
Therefore, the most appropriate initial diagnostic study is to determine the patient's serum albumin concentration, as low albumin levels are often associated with anorexia of aging.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: A previously healthy 24-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a low-grade fever and a nonproductive cough for 7 days. She has been able to continue her daily activities. Her temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F). A few scattered inspiratory crackles are heard in the thorax. An x-ray of the chest shows patchy infiltrates in both lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy? Choices: a) Amoxicillin b) Cefaclor c) Ciprofloxacin d) Erythromycin 
Output:
First, I need to determine the likely cause of the patient's symptoms. The patient has a low-grade fever, nonproductive cough, and patchy infiltrates in both lungs, which are consistent with a viral respiratory infection, such as bronchitis or pneumonia.
Next, I need to consider the patient's age and health status. The patient is a previously healthy 24-year-old woman, so she is not at high risk for complications from a viral infection.
Now, I need to choose an appropriate antibiotic. Since the patient is likely to have a viral infection, antibiotics are not necessary. However, if the patient had a bacterial infection, such as pneumonia, an antibiotic would be needed. Among the options, ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including those that cause pneumonia.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents because of a 2-hour history of confusion and agitation. He also has had fever, headache, stiff neck, and vomiting since he returned from summer camp 2 days ago. His parents say he does not use illicit drugs. On arrival, he is combative and there is evidence of hallucinations. His temperature is 40°C (104°F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. A lumbar puncture is performed. Results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis show cysts and trophozoites. The most likely portal of pathogen entry into this patient's central nervous system is which of the following? Choices: a) Facial nerve b) Frontal sinus c) Mastoid sinus d) Olfactory nerve 
Output:
First, I need to identify the pathogen that caused the infection. The presence of cysts and trophozoites in the cerebrospinal fluid suggests that the pathogen is a protozoan, likely Naegleria fowleri, which causes primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM).
Next, I need to determine the portal of entry for the pathogen. PAM is typically acquired through the nasal passage, where the amoeba enters the brain through the olfactory nerve.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 32-year-old male presents to the office with the complaint of pain in his right shoulder for the past two weeks. Physical examination reveals tenderness at the greater tubercle of the humerus and painful abduction of the right upper extremity. The cause of this patient's condition is most likely a somatic dysfunction of which of the following muscles? Choices: a) anterior scalene b) latissimus dorsi c) pectoralis minor d) supraspinatus 
Output:
First, I need to identify the location of the pain and the specific action that causes pain. The pain is located at the greater tubercle of the humerus, and the painful action is abduction of the right upper extremity.
Next, I need to consider the muscles that are involved in the action of abduction of the right upper extremity. The muscles that are primarily responsible for abduction are the deltoids and the supraspinatus.
The supraspinatus muscle is specifically responsible for the initiation of abduction, and it is attached to the greater tubercle of the humerus. Therefore, the cause of this patient's condition is most likely a somatic dysfunction of the supraspinatus muscle.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 19-year-old male presents to the office for evaluation after he was hit from behind below the right knee while playing football. Gait analysis reveals a lack of fluid motion. Standing flexion test results are negative. Cruciate and collateral knee ligaments appear intact. Foot drop on the right is noted. The most likely diagnosis is Choices: a) anteriorly deviated distal femur b) plantar flexed cuboid c) posteriorly deviated fibular head d) unilateral sacral shear 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key symptoms presented in the case. The patient was hit from behind below the knee, and the gait analysis shows a lack of fluid motion. The standing flexion test is negative, and the cruciate and collateral knee ligaments are intact. However, foot drop on the right is noted.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of foot drop. Foot drop is often caused by a nerve injury, particularly to the peroneal nerve, which is responsible for controlling the muscles that lift the foot.
Given the location of the injury (below the right knee) and the symptoms (foot drop), I suspect that the peroneal nerve was injured. The peroneal nerve runs close to the fibular head, so an injury to this area could cause nerve damage.
The most likely diagnosis is a posteriorly deviated fibular head, which would put pressure on the peroneal nerve and cause foot drop. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: A 45-year-old limousine driver comes to the office for an initial appointment because he would like you to fill out and sign a legal document at the request of his attorney. The patient states that he is filing a lawsuit against the limousine company that employs him because he developed post-traumatic stress disorder following a motor vehicle collision. He appears irritable and tense as he provides his history. He relays his symptoms by reading them aloud from a written list. At this time, which of the following is the most appropriate approach toward confirming the underlying diagnosis of this patient? Choices: a) Administer amobarbital and then interview the patient b) Ask the patient to provide a narrative with detailed description of the incident and of his symptoms c) Interview the patient under hypnosis d) Interview the patient while paying close attention to his willingness to make eye contact 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and behavior. The patient appears irritable and tense, and he is reading his symptoms from a written list, which may indicate that he is not fully engaged in the conversation.
Next, I need to consider the patient's request for a legal document to be signed by me. This may indicate that the patient is seeking a medical opinion to support a legal claim, rather than seeking treatment for his symptoms.
To confirm the underlying diagnosis, I need to gather more information about the patient's symptoms and history. Asking the patient to provide a narrative with detailed description of the incident and of his symptoms (option b) would allow me to gather more information and assess the patient's credibility.
Therefore, the most appropriate approach is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: A 5-year-old boy is admitted to the hospital because of a 1-week history of fever and increasingly severe abdominal discomfort. At the age of 7 months, he was treated for osteomyelitis caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. He has been admitted to the hospital three times during the past 4 years for severe pneumonia. He appears moderately ill. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Abdominal examination shows an enlarged, tender liver. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows an intrahepatic abscess. Culture of the abscess fluid grows Staphylococcus aureus. Further analysis shows failure of the neutrophils to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to S. aureus. This patient has an increased susceptibility to infection as a result of which of the following abnormalities? Choices: a) Failure of leukocytes to migrate between endothelial cells b) Failure of leukocytes to roll along the endothelial surface c) Inability of leukocytes to ingest microorganisms d) Inability of leukocytes to kill intracellular microorganisms 
Output:
First, I need to identify the type of infection the patient has. The patient has an intrahepatic abscess caused by Staphylococcus aureus, which is a type of bacterial infection.
Next, I need to understand the patient's immune system. The patient's neutrophils are unable to kill intracellular microorganisms, which means they are unable to perform their function of killing bacteria that have entered the cells.
Now, I need to determine the underlying cause of the patient's immune system failure. The patient's neutrophils are unable to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to S. aureus, which is a key mechanism for killing intracellular microorganisms.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A technician wants to determine whether cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA is present in the blood of a bone marrow transplant recipient. DNA purified from the leukocytes of the patient is reacted in a mixture containing oligonucleotides specific for CMV DNA, thermostable DNA polymerase, and nucleotides. Repetitive cycles of heating and cooling are performed, and the reaction product is detected by gel electrophoresis. The technician most likely used which of the following laboratory procedures on this patient's blood? Choices: a) Northern blotting b) Polymerase chain reaction c) Reverse transcription d) Southern blotting 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key components of the procedure described. The technician is using oligonucleotides specific for CMV DNA, which suggests that the goal is to amplify a specific DNA sequence.
Next, I need to consider the role of the thermostable DNA polymerase and nucleotides in the reaction. The presence of these components suggests that the reaction is a type of DNA amplification.
Now, I need to consider the repetitive cycles of heating and cooling, which are characteristic of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: A 2-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his babysitter because of a 30-minute history of respiratory distress. The babysitter reports that she is 15 years old and has cared for the patient on numerous occasions during the past year. The child's mother, who is a single parent, is currently out of town for business but will return later tonight. The babysitter says, ""He has had a runny nose since I started babysitting yesterday, but this afternoon he awoke from a nap with a barking sound and he was breathing real heavy."" She does not know the child's prior health history, nor does she know if the boy takes any medications on a regular basis. The child looks tired and sits upright on the babysitter's lap. He is obviously comfortable with his caregiver. Vital signs are temperature 38.7°C (101.7°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 28/min and labored, and blood pressure 85/50 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 89%. Physical examination discloses inspiratory stridor. Neck is supple, tympanic membranes are normal, and there is a profuse nasal discharge. Examination of the pharynx discloses no abnormalities. Auscultation of the chest discloses equal air entry on both sides and no crackles. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Treatment with 40% oxygen via venturi mask and intravenous fluids is initiated. Despite continued supplemental oxygen and hydration, the child remains tachypneic and stridorous at rest. Oxygen saturation is now 93%. In addition to administering racemic epinephrine by nebulizer, which of the following is the most appropriate next step? Choices: a) Intravenous aminophylline therapy b) Intravenous antibiotic therapy c) Intubation d) Oral dexamethasone therapy 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's condition. The patient is a 2-year-old boy with a 30-minute history of respiratory distress, characterized by a barking sound, heavy breathing, and inspiratory stridor. The patient's vital signs are abnormal, with a high temperature, tachycardia, tachypnea, and low oxygen saturation.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of the patient's condition. The patient's symptoms are consistent with croup, a common pediatric condition characterized by a barking cough and inspiratory stridor.
Now, I need to consider the appropriate treatment for the patient's condition. The patient has already been treated with supplemental oxygen and hydration, but the symptoms persist. The next step in treatment is to administer racemic epinephrine by nebulizer, which is a common treatment for croup.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 16-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-day history of abdominal pain and vomiting; he also has had decreased appetite during this period. The pain was initially on the right but now has become generalized. His temperature is 38.8°C (101.8°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 143/83 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows guarding with diffuse rebound tenderness. There are no palpable masses. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a perforated appendix. Examination of peritoneal fluid from this patient will most likely show which of the following organisms? Choices: a) Candida albicans b) Citrobacter freundii c) Escherichia coli d) Staphylococcus aureus 
Output:
First, I need to identify the likely source of the infection. The patient has a perforated appendix, which is a common cause of peritonitis.
Next, I need to consider the typical organisms associated with peritonitis. Peritonitis is often caused by bacteria that are part of the normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract.
Now, I need to consider the options. Candida albicans is a fungus, not a typical cause of peritonitis. Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of skin and soft tissue infections, but it is not typically associated with peritonitis. Citrobacter freundii is a type of gram-negative bacteria, but it is not the most common cause of peritonitis.
The most likely cause of peritonitis in this patient is Escherichia coli, which is a gram-negative bacteria that is commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 52-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 1-week history of low-grade fever and increasing abdominal cramps that are exacerbated by bowel movements. She began a course of amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole 2 days ago but has had no relief of her symptoms. She has had intermittent constipation for the past 12 years. She has not had nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or bloody stools. She has a 3-year history of hypertension. She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 5 years ago because of leiomyomata uteri. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. Her temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant with guarding but no rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The stool is brown, and test for occult blood is negative. Her hemoglobin concentration is 14.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 15,000/mm3, and platelet count is 280,000/mm3 ; serum studies and urinalysis show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis? Choices: a) Test of the stool for Clostridium difficile toxin b) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography c) Pelvic ultrasonography d) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and history. She has a 1-week history of low-grade fever and increasing abdominal cramps that are exacerbated by bowel movements, which suggests a gastrointestinal issue.
Next, I need to consider the patient's response to the current treatment. She has been taking amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole for 2 days, but she has had no relief of her symptoms, which suggests that the current treatment may not be effective.
Now, I need to consider the patient's history of intermittent constipation for the past 12 years, which may be related to her current symptoms.
Considering the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is a gastrointestinal issue such as diverticulitis or inflammatory bowel disease. However, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a clear diagnosis.
The most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be to test the stool for Clostridium difficile toxin, as this is a common cause of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients who have been taking antibiotics. This test is non-invasive and can provide a quick diagnosis.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: A 42-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-year history of vaginal bleeding for 2 to 5 days every 2 weeks. The flow varies from light to heavy with passage of clots. Menses previously occurred at regular 25- to 29-day intervals and lasted for 5 days with normal flow. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is sexually active with one male partner, and they use condoms inconsistently. Her mother died of colon cancer, and her maternal grandmother died of breast cancer. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 77 kg (170 lb); BMI is 29 kg/m2. Her temperature is 36.6°C (97.8°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. The uterus is normal sized. The ovaries cannot be palpated. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis? Choices: a) Progesterone challenge test b) Colposcopy c) Cystoscopy d) Endometrial biopsy 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient has a history of vaginal bleeding for 1 year, which is irregular and heavy. She also has a family history of breast and colon cancer.
Next, I need to consider the patient's physical examination and laboratory results. The patient's uterus is normal sized, and the ovaries cannot be palpated. The stool test for occult blood is negative.
Now, I need to consider the patient's age and symptoms. The patient is 42 years old and has a history of irregular and heavy vaginal bleeding. These symptoms are concerning for endometrial cancer, especially given her family history of breast and colon cancer.
Therefore, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis is to perform an endometrial biopsy to rule out endometrial cancer. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 13-year-old girl is brought to the office for a health maintenance visit. She was diagnosed with Turner syndrome in infancy during a work-up for coarctation of the aorta. During today's visit, her mother reports that the girl has been talking about babies. You have been the patient's physician for the past 6 years and know she is prepubescent. It is most appropriate to counsel the patient that if she wishes to have a family she will need to do which of the following? Choices: a) Adopt b) Have amniocentesis if she gets pregnant c) Have an operation d) Receive genetic counseling 
Output:
First, I need to understand the patient's condition. The patient has Turner syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that affects females, causing short stature, infertility, and other physical characteristics.
Next, I need to consider the patient's age and developmental stage. The patient is 13 years old and prepubescent, which means she is not yet physically developed enough to have children.
Now, I need to consider the patient's reproductive options. Since the patient has Turner syndrome, she is likely to be infertile, meaning she will not be able to conceive naturally.
Therefore, the most appropriate counseling for the patient is that if she wishes to have a family, she will need to consider adoption or other reproductive options, such as using a gestational carrier or in vitro fertilization with donor eggs.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 77-year-old man is brought to the physician because of a 12-hour history of word-finding difficulty and weakness and sensory loss of the right arm and leg. He has no history of similar symptoms. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. Current medications include metformin, lisinopril, and aspirin. He is alert. His pulse is 80/min and irregular, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 170/90 mm Hg. He follows commands but has nonfluent aphasia. There is moderate weakness and decreased sensation of the right upper and lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Babinski sign is present on the right. His serum glucose concentration is 162 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis? Choices: a) Carotid duplex ultrasonography b) CT scan of the head c) EEG d) Lumbar puncture 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient has a 12-hour history of word-finding difficulty, weakness, and sensory loss of the right arm and leg, which suggests a neurological issue.
The patient's history of atrial fibrillation is relevant, as it increases the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular events.
The patient's current medications, including aspirin, are also relevant, as they may affect the patient's risk of bleeding or stroke.
Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis is to determine the cause of the neurological symptoms.
A CT scan of the head is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis because it can help identify any structural abnormalities in the brain that may be causing the patient's symptoms.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 16-year-old high school student, whose prenatal course you have managed, delivers a 3256-g (7-lb 3-oz) baby girl during the night with the assistance of your associate. On morning rounds you note that the delivery records report that she had mildly elevated blood pressure during labor and sustained an estimated third-stage blood loss of 500 mL. Today blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg, she is afebrile, and deep tendon reflexes are normal. The uterine fundus is firm and at the level of the umbilicus, and her perineum is slightly edematous. Hematocrit is 33%. She is cuddling her infant and normal bonding seems to be occurring. Which of the following is the most important next step in management? Choices: a) Begin oral methyldopa b) Institute fundal massage c) Order daily sitz baths d) Provide education for well-baby care 
Output:
First, I need to assess the patient's condition. The patient is a 16-year-old high school student who has just delivered a baby girl. She had mildly elevated blood pressure during labor and sustained an estimated third-stage blood loss of 500 mL. Her current blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg, and she is afebrile with normal deep tendon reflexes. The uterine fundus is firm and at the level of the umbilicus, and her perineum is slightly edematous. Her hematocrit is 33%.
Next, I need to consider the potential complications of her condition. The patient's mildly elevated blood pressure during labor and third-stage blood loss of 500 mL may indicate postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), which is a serious condition that requires prompt management.
Now, I need to determine the most appropriate next step in management. The patient's current condition and potential complications suggest that she needs close monitoring and management to prevent further complications. Among the options provided, the most important next step in management is to provide education for well-baby care, as this will help the patient bond with her baby and ensure that the baby receives proper care. The other options, while potentially beneficial, are not as critical as providing education for well-baby care in this situation.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A previously healthy 17-year-old girl comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of exercise-induced cough and nasal congestion. She plays field hockey and has noticed she coughs when running up and down the field. The cough is nonproductive and resolves with rest. She has not had chest pain or palpitations. She takes no medications and does not smoke. Her sister has asthma. The patient appears well. Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 99%. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. Spirometry shows an FEV1:FVC ratio of 90% and an FEV1 of 90% of predicted. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Choices: a) Asthma b) Chronic bronchitis c) Gastroesophageal reflux disease d) Postnasal drip syndrome 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms. She has a 2-month history of exercise-induced cough and nasal congestion, which suggests a respiratory issue.
Next, I need to consider the patient's physical examination and laboratory results. The patient appears well, and her pulse, respirations, and blood pressure are within normal limits. The pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air, which suggests that she is not experiencing any significant respiratory distress. The cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities, and the chest x-ray shows no abnormalities. The spirometry results show an FEV1:FVC ratio of 90% and an FEV1 of 90% of predicted, which suggests that she does not have asthma.
Now, I need to consider the patient's history and physical examination. The patient has a history of exercise-induced cough and nasal congestion, which suggests that she may have a condition that is triggered by exercise. The patient's sister has asthma, which may suggest a genetic predisposition to respiratory conditions. However, the patient's spirometry results do not support a diagnosis of asthma.
Considering the patient's symptoms and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is postnasal drip syndrome. This condition is characterized by a sensation of mucus dripping down the back of the throat, which can cause coughing and nasal congestion. The patient's symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis, and the spirometry results do not support a diagnosis of asthma.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. One week ago, she was treated in the emergency department after she accidentally spilled hot grease on her left leg while working at a fast-food restaurant. Examination of the left lower extremity shows a 7-cm, pink, soft, granular, edematous wound. The formation of this tissue was most likely caused by increased activity of which of the following? Choices: a) Glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1 b) P-selectin c) Stromelysin d) Vascular endothelial growth factor 
Output:
First, I need to identify the type of tissue that has formed. The description of the tissue as ""pink, soft, granular, edematous"" suggests that it is granulation tissue.
Next, I need to understand the process of wound healing. Granulation tissue forms during the proliferative phase of wound healing, which occurs after the inflammatory phase.
During the proliferative phase, new blood vessels and connective tissue form, and the wound starts to close. This process is mediated by various growth factors and enzymes.
Now, I need to identify the growth factor that is most likely responsible for the formation of granulation tissue. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. It is also involved in the proliferation of endothelial cells and the formation of granulation tissue.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician for genetic counseling prior to conception. Her brother and maternal uncle had Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and died at the ages of 28 and 17 years, respectively. Genetic analysis was not performed on either relative prior to death. Serum studies show a muscle creatine kinase concentration of 120 U/L (N=22– 198). The patient's 50-year-old mother has a serum muscle creatine kinase concentration of 300 U/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of this patient's carrier status for this disease? Choices: a) The patient has a 50% risk of having a child with DMD b) The patient is a carrier of the disease based on her family history of DMD c) The patient is not a carrier of the DMD based on her normal creatine kinase concentration d) The patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain because of random X inactivation 
Output:
First, I need to understand the genetic basis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is an X-linked recessive disorder, which means that the gene responsible for the disease is located on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome.
Since the patient's brother and maternal uncle had DMD, it suggests that the patient's mother is a carrier of the disease. The patient's mother has a serum muscle creatine kinase concentration of 300 U/L, which is elevated, indicating that she is a carrier of the disease.
However, the patient's serum muscle creatine kinase concentration is normal (120 U/L), which suggests that she is not a carrier of the disease. This is because carriers of DMD typically have elevated muscle creatine kinase concentrations due to the random inactivation of the X chromosome carrying the disease gene.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 3-year-old white girl is brought to the office by her parents for a follow-up visit 48 hours after receiving a 5-TU PPD skin test. The test was done as part of a routine screening for enrollment in a homeless shelter. Physical examination shows 10 mm of induration at the puncture site; the examination is otherwise normal. The parents tell you they are shocked by this finding since both of their skin tests were nonreactive. They say they were born in this country and tell you that their daughter has always been in good health. She has not had much medical care in the past 2 years but she has been healthy. Until moving into this shelter they had been ""squatters"" in vacant buildings. Which of the following is the most appropriate step at this time? Choices: a) Call her previous physician to obtain more history b) Order a chest x-ray c) Order a test for HIV antibody d) Repeat the PPD skin test 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's history and the current situation. The patient is a 3-year-old girl who has been living in a homeless shelter, which increases her risk of exposure to tuberculosis (TB).
The patient's parents are shocked by the positive PPD skin test result, but they were born in this country and have a history of nonreactive skin tests. This suggests that the patient's positive result may be due to exposure to TB in the shelter.
The patient's physical examination shows 10 mm of induration at the puncture site, which is a significant reaction.
Given the patient's age and the size of the reaction, the most appropriate step is to order a chest x-ray to evaluate for pulmonary TB.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: A 65-year-old female is admitted to the hospital after experiencing aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis. She subsequently develops urinary incontinence. There is no evidence of urinary tract infection and no prior history of urinary pathology. The most likely diagnosis is Choices: a) autonomic neurogenic bladderv b) motor paralytic bladder c) reflex neurogenic bladder d) uninhibited neurogenic bladder 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key symptoms presented in the case: aphasia, right-sided hemiparesis, and urinary incontinence. 
Aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis suggest a left hemisphere stroke, which is a common cause of urinary incontinence in the elderly.
The absence of urinary tract infection and prior history of urinary pathology makes an acute onset of urinary incontinence more likely.
Considering the options, the most likely diagnosis is reflex neurogenic bladder, which is characterized by an overactive bladder with involuntary contractions and incontinence, often seen in the context of a stroke or other neurological injury.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: A 35-year-old woman comes to the office because of a 3-day history of severe right back pain. She has not had any fever, chills, or weight loss. She has no history of major medical illness. Musculoskeletal and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. When told that her examination is normal, the patient becomes tearful and demands an MRI of her back because her mother just died from breast cancer metastatic to bone and she fears that she may also have cancer. The patient already contacted her insurance company, who told her that if she has neurologic abnormalities an MRI may be covered by her plan. The patient asks the physician to order the MRI indicating that she has neurologic findings. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the physician? Choices: a) Advise the patient to change insurance companies as soon as she is able so that she can receive more comprehensive medical care b) Explain that the patient does not need the MRI and that it is not appropriate to misrepresent her examination findings c) Immediately inform the patient's insurance company about what the patient has asked the physician to do d) Order the MRI as the patient requests 
Output:
First, I need to acknowledge the patient's concerns and empathize with her fear of having cancer, given her family history.
Next, I need to explain to the patient that her examination is normal and that there are no neurologic findings to justify an MRI.
I need to address the patient's request to misrepresent her examination findings, which is unethical and potentially illegal.
I need to explain to the patient that ordering an MRI based on a false representation of her examination findings would be inappropriate and potentially harmful.
I need to inform the patient that I will not order the MRI as requested, but I will discuss with her other options for evaluating her back pain, such as a follow-up appointment or a referral to a specialist.
Therefore, the most appropriate initial action by the physician is to explain that the patient does not need the MRI and that it is not appropriate to misrepresent her examination findings. {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 32-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being struck by a car while driving his motorcycle. He reports severe pelvic pain. On examination, there is bruising of the perineum and pain is elicited with motion of his pelvis. Blood is noted at the urethral meatus. There is no other penile trauma. A plain x-ray shows a fracture of the superior pubic ramus and retrograde urethrography is done to evaluate for a urethral disruption. Which of the following portions of the urethra would be at greatest risk for injury in this patient? Choices: a) Intramural (pre-prostatic) b) Membranous c) Prostatic d) Spongy 
Output:
First, I need to understand the anatomy of the urethra. The urethra is divided into four parts: the prostatic, membranous, bulbar, and penile (spongy) urethra.
The patient has a pelvic fracture, which is a high-energy injury. The urethra is at risk of injury in this situation.
The membranous urethra is the most susceptible to injury in pelvic fractures. This is because it is the shortest and most fixed portion of the urethra, making it more prone to disruption.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 33-year-old female presents to the office with the complaint of chronic pelvic pain that began after she underwent a hysterectomy 6 months ago. Following a physical examination, a CT scan of the pelvis is ordered. After the scan is complete, the radiologist calls to report that the patient has a surgical sponge in her pelvis. In a subsequent malpractice suit, the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence. The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is Choices: a) collateral estoppel b) proximate cause c) res ipsa loquitur d) respondeat superior 
Output:
First, I need to understand the situation. The patient underwent a hysterectomy and now has a surgical sponge in her pelvis, which could not have happened unless there was negligence.
Next, I need to consider the legal concept that applies to this situation. The key phrase here is ""could not have happened unless there was negligence.""
The legal concept that fits this situation is res ipsa loquitur, which means ""the thing speaks for itself."" This concept is used when an accident or injury would not have occurred without negligence.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

The patient is thin and is in no acute distress. Auscultation of the chest discloses scattered bilateral basilar crackles. There is mild left hip pain present with both active and passive range of motion. Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact. Neurologic examination is normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? Choices: a) Avascular necrosis of the femoral head b) Herniated nucleus pulposus c) Narrowing of the hip joint d) Osteoporosis 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient has been taking glucocorticoid therapy for the past 6 months, which can cause a variety of side effects, including osteoporosis and avascular necrosis of the femoral head.
The patient's symptoms of pain in his legs that increases with weight-bearing and mild left hip pain with both active and passive range of motion suggest a problem with the hip joint.
Considering the patient's age and medical history, the most likely cause of his symptoms is avascular necrosis of the femoral head, which is a known side effect of long-term glucocorticoid therapy.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: A 67-year-old man with Parkinson disease is admitted to the hospital for treatment of pneumonia. The patient's daughter, who is visiting the patient, says he has had increased lethargy for the past day and decreased ambulation during the past 6 months. She also says that there are times during the day when his tremors increase in severity, although he continues to care for himself at home. Medical history is also remarkable for hypertension. Medications include hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 78 kg (172 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2. Vital signs are temperature 38.9°C (102.0°F), pulse 60/min supine and 68/min standing, respirations 22/min, and blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg supine and 80/50 mm Hg standing. The patient appears ill and older than his stated age. He is fully oriented but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses rhonchi in the right mid lung field. Abdominal examination discloses no abnormalities. Neurologic examination discloses masked facies, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity; gait was not assessed on admission. Chest x-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate. ECG shows no abnormalities. Appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy is initiated. Prior to discharge, which of the following is the most appropriate step? Choices: a) Obtain CT scan of the chest b) Obtain a swallowing evaluation c) Place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube d) Prescribe fludrocortisone 
Output:
First, I need to assess the patient's overall condition and the severity of his pneumonia. The patient has a fever of 38.9°C (102.0°F), which indicates a significant infection. The patient's pneumonia is located in the right lower lobe, as shown on the chest x-ray.
Next, I need to consider the patient's Parkinson disease and its potential impact on his respiratory function. Patients with Parkinson disease often have difficulty swallowing, which can increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Therefore, it is essential to assess the patient's swallowing function before discharge.
The most appropriate step prior to discharge is to obtain a swallowing evaluation to assess the patient's risk of aspiration and to determine if any interventions are needed to prevent further complications.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: A 64-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 5-month history of increasing shortness of breath, sore throat, and a cough productive of a small amount of white phlegm. Over the past week, she has had nausea related to excess coughing. Over the past year, she has had a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss. She has asthma treated with theophylline and inhaled β-adrenergic agonists and corticosteroids. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 44 years and drinks one alcoholic beverage daily. She appears thin. Examination shows a 2-cm, nontender lymph node in the right supraclavicular area. Examination shows no other abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows a large right lower lobe density. A CT scan of the chest shows a 7.5 x 7.5 x 6-cm right lower lobe mass with some scattered calcifications. The lesion abuts the posterior chest wall without clear invasion. There are right lower peritracheal, precarinal, right hilar, and subcarinal lymph nodes. There is a 1.5-cm mass in the right adrenal gland. A biopsy specimen of the lung mass is most likely to show which of the following? Choices: a) Mesothelioma b) Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast c) Multiple endocrine neoplasia d) Non-small cell lung carcinoma 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and history. The patient has a 5-month history of increasing shortness of breath, sore throat, and a cough productive of a small amount of white phlegm, which suggests a respiratory problem.
Next, I need to consider the patient's risk factors for lung cancer. The patient has a history of smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for 44 years, which is a major risk factor for lung cancer.
Now, I need to consider the patient's examination and diagnostic test results. The patient has a 2-cm, nontender lymph node in the right supraclavicular area, which suggests metastasis. The chest x-ray shows a large right lower lobe density, and the CT scan shows a 7.5 x 7.5 x 6-cm right lower lobe mass with some scattered calcifications. The lesion abuts the posterior chest wall without clear invasion, and there are right lower peritracheal, precarinal, right hilar, and subcarinal lymph nodes. There is also a 1.5-cm mass in the right adrenal gland.
Based on the patient's symptoms, history, and diagnostic test results, the most likely diagnosis is lung cancer. The patient's symptoms and history suggest that the cancer is likely to be non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), which is the most common type of lung cancer.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 46-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1, comes to the office because of a 2-week history of black discharge from her right nipple. The patient had mammography and ultrasonography of the breasts 2 months ago for evaluation of increased glandularity, palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, noted at her most recent annual examination. The studies showed likely benign findings with recommended follow-up in 6 months. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable and she takes no medications. BMI is 30 kg/m2. Vital signs are normal. Palpation of the right breast discloses glandularity in the upper outer quadrant but no other masses. There is scant, black discharge from the right nipple. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis? Choices: a) Ductography b) Excisional biopsy of glandular tissue c) Repeat mammography d) Repeat ultrasonography of the right breast 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient is a 46-year-old woman with a 2-week history of black discharge from her right nipple. This symptom is concerning for a possible breast malignancy, such as a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or an invasive ductal carcinoma.
Next, I need to consider the patient's previous mammography and ultrasonography results. The studies showed likely benign findings with recommended follow-up in 6 months. However, the patient's current symptoms are new and warrant further evaluation.
Now, I need to consider the patient's BMI and vital signs. The patient has a BMI of 30 kg/m2, which is classified as obese. Obesity is a risk factor for breast cancer. However, the patient's vital signs are normal, which suggests that she does not have any acute symptoms that require immediate attention.
To determine the most appropriate next step in diagnosis, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and previous test results. Ductography is a diagnostic test that involves injecting a contrast agent into the milk ducts of the breast to visualize the ductal system. This test is often used to evaluate nipple discharge, especially if it is bloody or black. Given the patient's symptoms and previous test results, ductography is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: A 37-year-old woman with AIDS comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of progressive diarrhea and a 1.8- kg (4-lb) weight loss. During the past week, she has had six large watery stools daily. She is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy. She is employed as a flight attendant and works regularly on domestic flights throughout the USA. She also flies to Asia at least once monthly. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 112/64 mm Hg. The abdomen is scaphoid. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 400/mm3 (Normal≥500). Which of the following is the most likely causal organism? Choices: a) Cryptosporidium parvum b) Cytomegalovirus c) Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex d) Salmonella enteritidis 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient has a 1-month history of progressive diarrhea and a 1.8-kg weight loss, which suggests a gastrointestinal infection.
Next, I need to consider the patient's immunocompromised status. The patient has AIDS and is receiving triple antiretroviral therapy, which means she has a weakened immune system.
Now, I need to consider the patient's travel history. The patient flies to Asia at least once monthly, which increases her risk of exposure to certain pathogens.
Considering the patient's symptoms, immunocompromised status, and travel history, I need to evaluate the possible causes of her diarrhea. 
Cryptosporidium parvum is a common cause of diarrhea in immunocompromised patients, especially those with AIDS. It is also a common cause of diarrhea in travelers to Asia.
Cytomegalovirus is a common cause of diarrhea in immunocompromised patients, but it is less likely to be the cause in this case since the patient's CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is relatively high.
Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex is a common cause of diarrhea in immunocompromised patients, but it is less likely to be the cause in this case since the patient's symptoms are primarily gastrointestinal rather than systemic.
Salmonella enteritidis is a common cause of diarrhea in travelers to Asia, but it is less likely to be the cause in this case since the patient's symptoms are primarily watery diarrhea rather than bloody diarrhea.
Therefore, the most likely causal organism is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A healthy 22-year-old man participates in a study of glucose metabolism. At the beginning of the study, his serum glucose concentration is within the reference range. He consumes an 800-calorie meal consisting of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. He then sleeps through the night without additional food or drink. Twelve hours later, his serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely involved in maintaining this man's serum glucose concentration? Choices: a) Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal b) Glucose release from skeletal muscle c) Glycogenolysis in the liver d) Increased leptin release from adipose tissues 
Output:
First, I need to consider the time frame of the study. The man consumes the meal and then sleeps through the night without additional food or drink. This means that the gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal would have stopped by the time his serum glucose concentration is measured 12 hours later.
Next, I need to consider the body's glucose regulation mechanisms. Glucose release from skeletal muscle is not a significant source of glucose in the bloodstream, especially after a meal. Glycogenolysis in the liver is the breakdown of glycogen to glucose, but this would increase blood glucose levels, not maintain them.
Finally, I need to consider the role of leptin in glucose regulation. Leptin is a hormone released by adipose tissue that helps regulate energy balance and glucose metabolism. Increased leptin release from adipose tissues would help to maintain serum glucose concentration by suppressing glucose production in the liver and increasing glucose uptake in peripheral tissues.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A previously healthy 22-year-old college student is brought to the emergency department by her parents 20 minutes after they observed her having a seizure. After the seizure, she was confused and had difficulty thinking of some words. She has had a headache, cough, and fever for 3 days treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102°F). Neurologic examination shows diffuse hyperreflexia. On mental status examination, she is confused and has short-term memory deficits. She has difficulty naming objects and makes literal paraphasic errors. An MRI of the brain shows bitemporal hyperintensities. A lumbar puncture is done; cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows an erythrocyte count of 340/mm3, a leukocyte count of 121/mm3 (88% monocytes), and a protein concentration of 78 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Choices: a) Bacterial meningitis b) Dextromethorphan intoxication c) Herpes simplex encephalitis d) HIV encephalopathy 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms. The patient has had a headache, cough, and fever for 3 days, which suggests an infectious process. However, the patient has also had difficulty thinking of some words and has made literal paraphasic errors, which suggests a problem with language processing.
Next, I need to consider the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The CSF shows an elevated erythrocyte count, leukocyte count, and protein concentration, which suggests an inflammatory process. However, the predominance of monocytes in the CSF suggests a viral etiology.
Now, I need to consider the MRI findings. The bitemporal hyperintensities on the MRI suggest a temporal lobe process, which is consistent with herpes simplex encephalitis.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of increased facial hair growth. Her last menstrual period was 4 months ago. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m2. Her pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows temporal balding and coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin. Pelvic examination shows clitoral enlargement. Her serum testosterone concentration is increased. Serum concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are within the reference ranges. Ultrasonography of the pelvis shows a 12-cm ovarian mass. Which of the following best describes this mass? Choices: a) Granulosa tumor b) Ovarian carcinoid c) Sertoli-Leydig tumor d) Teratoma 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key features of the case. The patient is a 40-year-old woman with a 6-month history of increased facial hair growth, temporal balding, and clitoral enlargement. Her serum testosterone concentration is increased, but the serum concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are within the reference ranges.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of the patient's symptoms. The increased facial hair growth, temporal balding, and clitoral enlargement suggest an excess of androgens, which is consistent with a tumor that produces androgens.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. A granulosa tumor (choice a) is a type of sex cord-stromal tumor that typically produces estrogen, not androgen. An ovarian carcinoid (choice b) is a type of neuroendocrine tumor that can produce various hormones, but it is not typically associated with androgen excess. A Sertoli-Leydig tumor (choice c) is a type of sex cord-stromal tumor that can produce androgens, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms. A teratoma (choice d) is a type of germ cell tumor that can produce various hormones, but it is not typically associated with androgen excess.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 77-year-old female presents to the office for evaluation of a syncopal event that occurred while she was walking. Cardiac examination reveals a grade 3/6 systolic murmur, heard best at the right upper sternal border. There is radiation of the murmur into the neck. The valvular abnormality that most likely caused this episode is Choices: a) aortic insufficiency b) aortic stenosis c) mitral regurgitation d) mitral stenosis 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key information from the case. The patient is a 77-year-old female who experienced a syncopal event while walking. The cardiac examination reveals a grade 3/6 systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border with radiation into the neck.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of the murmur. A systolic murmur is a type of heart murmur that occurs during systole, when the heart is contracting. The location and radiation of the murmur can help narrow down the possible causes.
The murmur is heard best at the right upper sternal border, which suggests that it is related to the aortic valve. The radiation into the neck is also consistent with aortic stenosis, as the murmur can be heard in the carotid arteries.
Considering the age of the patient and the characteristics of the murmur, I believe that the most likely cause is aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis is a condition in which the aortic valve becomes narrowed, impeding blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. It is more common in older adults and can cause symptoms such as syncope, chest pain, and shortness of breath.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Three weeks ago a 45-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of frostbite of both feet. He was treated by rapid rewarming and protective care of the feet. All the toes on the right foot have turned black. He has become slightly febrile and progressively more confused during the past few days. Examination discloses cellulitis in the midfoot. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment? Choices: a) Amputation b) Application of topical collagenase c) Debridement of necrotic skin over the toes d) Hyperbaric oxygen 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main issue with the patient. The patient has frostbite of both feet, with all the toes on the right foot having turned black, indicating gangrene.
Next, I need to consider the patient's symptoms. The patient has become febrile and progressively more confused, which could be signs of sepsis.
Now, I need to consider the treatment options. Amputation (a) might be necessary in some cases, but it's not the first line of treatment. Application of topical collagenase (b) is not a standard treatment for frostbite. Hyperbaric oxygen (d) might be helpful in some cases, but it's not the most appropriate treatment in this case.
The most appropriate treatment is debridement of necrotic skin over the toes (c), which would help to remove dead tissue and prevent further infection.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: A 35-year-old man comes to the office because of 1-week history of mid low back pain that radiates down his right leg. The pain began after the patient lifted a heavy box onto his truck. He rates his current pain as an 8 on a 10-point scale. He has been unable to find a comfortable position and has been sleeping in a recliner. Medical history is unremarkable and he takes no medications. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 25 years, and he drinks a six-pack of beer on Friday and Saturday nights. BMI is 27 kg/m2. He appears uncomfortable and stands during the physical examination. Vital signs are normal. Straight-leg raise test is positive on the right, with loss of right ankle reflex. The remainder of the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient’s symptoms? Choices: a) Displacement of the nucleus pulposus b) Hypertrophy of the facet joints c) Osteophyte formation d) Spondylolisthesis 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and history. The patient has a 1-week history of mid low back pain that radiates down his right leg, which began after lifting a heavy box. He rates his pain as an 8 on a 10-point scale and has been unable to find a comfortable position.
Next, I need to consider the patient's physical examination findings. The straight-leg raise test is positive on the right, indicating sciatic nerve irritation, and there is loss of the right ankle reflex, suggesting nerve root compression.
Now, I need to consider the possible explanations for the patient's symptoms. Displacement of the nucleus pulposus (choice a) is a common cause of sciatica and nerve root compression, particularly in patients with a history of heavy lifting or bending. Hypertrophy of the facet joints (choice b) can cause back pain, but it is less likely to cause radiating pain down the leg. Osteophyte formation (choice c) can cause back pain, but it is less likely to cause nerve root compression. Spondylolisthesis (choice d) is a condition in which a vertebra slips out of place, which can cause back pain and nerve root compression, but it is less likely in a patient with a history of heavy lifting.
Therefore, the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of pain and swelling of his right arm where he scraped it on a tree branch 2 days ago. His temperature is 38.3°C (101°F). Examination of the right forearm shows edema around a fluctuant erythematous lesion at the site of trauma. The area is extremely tender to palpation. Which of the following is most likely the primary mechanism of the development of edema in this patient? Choices: a) Disruption of vascular basement membranes b) Increased hydrostatic pressure c) Release of thromboxane d) Separation of endothelial junctions 
Output:
First, I need to identify the type of injury the patient has. The patient has a fluctuant erythematous lesion at the site of trauma, which is a sign of an abscess.
Next, I need to consider the primary mechanism of the development of edema in this patient. The patient has an abscess, which is a collection of pus. The pus is a result of an infection, which is likely caused by bacteria.
The primary mechanism of the development of edema in this patient is the release of chemical mediators, such as histamine and bradykinin, which cause the blood vessels to become permeable and allow fluid to leak out into the tissues. This is choice d) Separation of endothelial junctions.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 22-year-old woman comes to the physician in October for a follow-up examination. She feels well. She has a 2-year history of type 1 diabetes mellitus controlled with insulin. She had a normal Pap smear 3 months ago and saw her ophthalmologist 6 months ago. Her 67-year-old grandmother has breast cancer. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 57 kg (125 lb); BMI is 20 kg/m2. Her hemoglobin A1c is 6.2%, and fingerstick blood glucose concentration is 118 mg/dL. Which of the following health maintenance recommendations is most appropriate at this time? Choices: a) Dietary modification for weight loss b) Human papillomavirus testing c) Mammography d) Influenza virus vaccine 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's age and health status. The patient is 22 years old and has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, which is well-controlled.
Next, I need to consider the patient's risk factors for various health conditions. The patient's grandmother has breast cancer, which may increase the patient's risk for breast cancer, but the patient is still relatively young and has no other risk factors.
Now, I need to consider the patient's health maintenance needs. The patient is due for a routine examination and has no other health concerns that require immediate attention.
The patient is not a candidate for mammography, as she is too young. The patient is not a candidate for human papillomavirus testing, as she has had a normal Pap smear recently. The patient is not a candidate for dietary modification for weight loss, as her BMI is within the normal range.
Therefore, the most appropriate health maintenance recommendation at this time is the influenza virus vaccine, as the patient is at risk for influenza due to her underlying medical condition.
{'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 42-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. Four months ago, he underwent repair of a Dupuytren contracture. Physical examination shows decreased range of motion in the affected hand. The patient is upset that his hand has not fully healed, and he files a malpractice suit against the physician. Which of the following is the most likely precipitating factor in this patient's decision to file a malpractice suit? Choices: a) The patient's perception that the physician is incompetent b) The patient's perception that the physician is uncaring c) The patient's socioeconomic status d) The physician's amount of experience in the medical field 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's situation. He underwent a surgical procedure four months ago and is now upset that his hand has not fully healed.
Next, I need to think about what might be driving his decision to file a malpractice suit. The patient is upset about the outcome of his treatment, which suggests that he may be feeling a sense of injustice or dissatisfaction with the care he received.
Now, I need to consider the options. Choice a) The patient's perception that the physician is incompetent is a possible factor, but it's not the most likely one. The patient is upset about the outcome of his treatment, not necessarily about the physician's competence.
Choice b) The patient's perception that the physician is uncaring is also a possible factor, but it's not the most likely one. The patient is upset about the outcome of his treatment, not necessarily about the physician's bedside manner.
Choice c) The patient's socioeconomic status is a relevant factor. The patient is upset about the outcome of his treatment, and his socioeconomic status may be influencing his perception of the situation. For example, if the patient is from a lower socioeconomic background, he may be more likely to feel that he has been treated unfairly.
Choice d) The physician's amount of experience in the medical field is not a relevant factor. The patient is upset about the outcome of his treatment, not about the physician's level of experience.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: During a study of renal glomeruli, a healthy animal kidney is kept in a vascular bath preparation at a constant afferent arterial pressure of 100 mm Hg. If the efferent arteriole is constricted with a vascular clamp, which of the following Starling forces is most likely to change in the glomeruli? Choices: a) Decreased filtration coefficient (Kf) b) Decreased hydrostatic pressure c) Decreased oncotic pressure d) Increased hydrostatic pressure 
Output:
First, I need to understand the effect of constricting the efferent arteriole with a vascular clamp. Constricting the efferent arteriole increases the resistance to blood flow out of the glomerulus, which means that the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerulus increases.
Next, I need to consider the effect of the increased hydrostatic pressure on the Starling forces. The increased hydrostatic pressure would increase the force favoring filtration, but the question asks which force is most likely to change.
Now, I need to consider the other Starling forces. The filtration coefficient (Kf) is a constant that depends on the properties of the glomerular capillaries and is not affected by the constriction of the efferent arteriole. The oncotic pressure is determined by the concentration of proteins in the blood and is not directly affected by the constriction of the efferent arteriole. The hydrostatic pressure in the afferent arteriole is constant at 100 mm Hg.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 0, aborta 1, at 28 weeks' gestation comes to the office for a prenatal visit. She has had one previous pregnancy resulting in a spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks' gestation. Today, her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 28-week gestation. Fetal ultrasonography shows a male fetus with no abnormalities. Her blood group is O, Rh-negative. The father's blood group is B, Rh-positive. The physician recommends administration of Rho Choices: a) immune globulin to the patient. This treatment is most likely to prevent which of the following in this mother? b) Development of natural killer cells c) Development of polycythemia d) Formation of antibodies to RhD 
Output:
First, I need to understand the patient's situation. The patient is a 30-year-old woman who is 28 weeks pregnant with her second child. She has had one previous pregnancy that ended in a spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks' gestation. This means she has had one previous pregnancy that was not carried to term.
Next, I need to consider the patient's blood type and the father's blood type. The patient is Rh-negative, while the father is Rh-positive. This means that the fetus is likely to be Rh-positive, as it inherits the Rh-positive gene from the father.
Now, I need to consider the potential risks associated with the patient's situation. The patient is at risk of developing antibodies to RhD, which could lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) in future pregnancies. To prevent this, the physician recommends administration of Rho(D) immune globulin (RhIg) to the patient.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 46-year-old man with Marfan syndrome, aortic insufficiency, and mitral regurgitation comes to the emergency department because he has had severe substernal chest pain for the past 3 hours. He describes the pain as tearing in quality and radiating to the neck. One week earlier he experienced similar but less severe chest pain and treated himself with aspirin. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause for his worsening symptoms? Choices: a) Acute bacterial endocarditis b) Acute myocardial infarction c) Dissection of the aorta d) Esophageal reflux with spasm 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms. He has severe substernal chest pain that is tearing in quality and radiates to the neck. This type of pain is often associated with aortic dissection.
Next, I need to consider the patient's medical history. He has Marfan syndrome, aortic insufficiency, and mitral regurgitation, which are all conditions that can increase the risk of aortic dissection.
Now, I need to consider the patient's recent history. He experienced similar but less severe chest pain one week earlier and treated himself with aspirin. This suggests that the pain may be related to a condition that is not improving with treatment.
Based on these considerations, the most likely underlying cause for his worsening symptoms is a dissection of the aorta.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: A 47-year-old man is admitted to the hospital through the emergency department because of the sudden onset of palpitations, left-sided chest pain, light-headedness, and shortness of breath that began while he was watching television 2 hours ago. Medical history is remarkable for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 82 kg (180 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2. ECG obtained in the emergency department showed atrial fibrillation with narrow QRS complex. Pulse was 146/min. Physical examination was remarkable for rapid heart rate. The patient was given oxygen via nasal cannula and intravenous metoprolol 5 mg every 5 minutes for a total of 15 mg. His pulse slowed to 90/min. Two hours after admission, he is pain free but his pulse is now 160/min. Blood pressure is 122/78 mm Hg. In order to decrease the patient's pulse, which of the following should be administered intravenously? Choices: a) Digoxin b) Enalapril c) Lidocaine d) Metoprolol 
Output:
First, I need to understand the patient's current condition. The patient is experiencing palpitations, chest pain, light-headedness, and shortness of breath, and his pulse is 160/min.
The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which is a type of irregular heartbeat.
The patient was given metoprolol, a beta-blocker, to slow down his heart rate, but it only worked for a short time.
Now, I need to consider the patient's current symptoms and the fact that he has atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a type of arrhythmia that can cause the heart to beat too quickly.
To decrease the patient's pulse, I need to consider medications that can help regulate the heart rate.
Digoxin is a medication that can help regulate the heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation, but it is not the best choice in this case because the patient's pulse is already high.
Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor that can help lower blood pressure, but it is not the best choice in this case because the patient's blood pressure is already within a normal range.
Lidocaine is a medication that can help regulate the heart rate, but it is not the best choice in this case because it is not typically used to treat atrial fibrillation.
Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that can help slow down the heart rate, but it only worked for a short time in this case.
Therefore, the best choice is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 73-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of diffuse weakness and tingling of her arms and legs. Neurologic examination shows weakness of the extensor and flexor muscles of the lower extremities. Knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes are exaggerated. Sensation to vibration and position is decreased in all extremities, but the decrease is more prominent in the lower extremities than in the upper extremities. This patient most likely has a deficiency of which of the following vitamins? Choices: a) Vitamin B1 (thiamine) b) Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) c) Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) d) Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms presented by the patient. The patient has diffuse weakness and tingling of her arms and legs, weakness of the extensor and flexor muscles of the lower extremities, exaggerated knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes, and decreased sensation to vibration and position in all extremities.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these symptoms. The symptoms suggest a neurological disorder, and the patient's age and symptoms are consistent with a deficiency of a vitamin that is important for the nervous system.
Now, I need to consider the options. Vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency is associated with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which presents with confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia, not the symptoms presented by this patient. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) deficiency is associated with ariboflavinosis, which presents with cracks in the corners of the mouth, inflammation of the tongue, and a magenta-colored tongue, not the symptoms presented by this patient. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) deficiency is associated with peripheral neuropathy, but the symptoms are typically more severe and involve more than just the lower extremities. Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) deficiency is associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, which presents with weakness, stiffness, and spasticity of the legs, and decreased sensation to vibration and position in the lower extremities, consistent with the patient's symptoms.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Over 1 year, a study is conducted to assess the antileukemic activity of a new tyrosine kinase inhibitor in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis. All patients enrolled in the study are informed that they would be treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor. They are assigned to successive dose cohorts of 300 to 1000 mg/day of the drug. Six to eight patients are assigned to each dose. Treatment efficacy is determined based on the results of complete blood counts and bone marrow assessments conducted regularly throughout the study. This study is best described as which of the following? Choices: a) Case-control study b) Crossover study c) Open-labeled clinical trial d) Randomized clinical trial 
Output:
First, I need to understand the study design. The study involves patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis, and they are treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
The study has successive dose cohorts, ranging from 300 to 1000 mg/day, and each cohort has 6-8 patients.
The treatment efficacy is determined based on regular complete blood counts and bone marrow assessments.
Now, I need to consider the characteristics of each study type. A case-control study involves comparing patients with a specific condition (cases) to those without the condition (controls). A crossover study involves patients receiving different treatments in a sequence. An open-labeled clinical trial involves patients knowing which treatment they are receiving. A randomized clinical trial involves patients being randomly assigned to different treatments.
In this study, patients are assigned to successive dose cohorts, and the treatment efficacy is determined based on regular assessments. This suggests that the study is not a case-control study, as there is no comparison to patients without the condition. It is also not a crossover study, as patients are not receiving different treatments in a sequence. It is also not an open-labeled clinical trial, as patients are not knowing which treatment they are receiving. Therefore, the study is best described as a randomized clinical trial, as patients are being randomly assigned to different treatments.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 25-year-old man comes to the emergency department because he developed chest pain and shortness of breath 1 hour ago, shortly after snorting cocaine for the first time. He rates the chest pain as a 7 on a 10-point scale and notes that the pain is radiating down his left arm. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications or any other illicit drugs. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. The patient is diaphoretic. Vital signs are temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 200/100 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Auscultation of the heart discloses an audible S1 and S2. There is no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing of the digits. The patient is fully oriented. He is treated with supplemental oxygen, a 325-mg aspirin tablet, and intravenous nitroglycerin and lorazepam. Despite therapy, he continues to have chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time? Choices: a) Carvedilol b) Furosemide c) Metoprolol d) Phentolamine 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's condition. The patient is experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath after snorting cocaine for the first time, which suggests a cocaine-induced cardiac event.
Next, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and vital signs. The patient has a high blood pressure (200/100 mm Hg), tachycardia (110/min), and diaphoresis, which are consistent with a cocaine-induced cardiac event.
Now, I need to consider the appropriate pharmacotherapy. The patient is already receiving nitroglycerin and lorazepam, which are appropriate for managing cocaine-induced cardiac events. However, the patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and the patient continues to experience chest pain and shortness of breath.
The most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time is a beta-blocker, such as metoprolol, to help control the patient's tachycardia and hypertension. Phentolamine is a non-selective alpha-blocker that can be used to treat cocaine-induced hypertension, but it is not the first-line treatment. Carvedilol is a beta-blocker with alpha-blocking activity, but it is not typically used in this scenario. Furosemide is a diuretic that may be used to treat hypertension, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this scenario.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A phase 2, multicenter trial was conducted to determine the efficacy of a new vaccine for prevention of HIV infection. The study enrolled 4000 subjects, aged 20 to 65 years. Of these subjects, 2100 were men and 1900 were women; 2500 were white, 1000 were African American, 300 were Hispanic, and 200 were Asian/Pacific Islanders. Results of the trial showed no overall benefit of the vaccine. However, post hoc analysis disclosed a small but statistically significant vaccine protection among African American subjects. Which of the following is the most accurate rationale for questioning the validity of efficacy analysis of the HIV vaccine among the African American study subjects? Choices: a) HIV infection is more prevalent among African American populations b) The study was not blinded c) There was a Type II error d) Vaccine response among African American subjects was not the primary outcome measure 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the problem. The study is about the efficacy of a new vaccine for preventing HIV infection, and the results showed no overall benefit of the vaccine. However, post hoc analysis revealed a small but statistically significant vaccine protection among African American subjects.
Next, I need to identify the potential issue with the analysis. The fact that the vaccine showed a benefit among African American subjects, but not overall, suggests that the analysis may be biased or flawed.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) is a fact about the prevalence of HIV infection among African American populations, but it does not explain why the analysis may be flawed. Option b) mentions that the study was not blinded, but this is not directly related to the issue at hand. Option c) suggests a Type II error, but this would imply that the study failed to detect a real effect, which is not the case here. Option d) states that vaccine response among African American subjects was not the primary outcome measure, which is the most accurate rationale for questioning the validity of the efficacy analysis.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 33-year-old male physician reports for a shift in the emergency department. A nurse alerts you that he noticed a faint odor of alcohol near the physician. When approached, the physician appears tired and more disheveled than usual. There is an odor of alcohol on his breath. He is a skilled and talented physician with no known history of substance or alcohol use disorder. He is married with three children, and his wife is pregnant with twins. The physician was recently hired and has had no actions on his license by any state medical board. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step? Choices: a) Ask the physician if he is sober, and if he says yes, allow him to complete his shift b) Explain to the physician that you suspect he is intoxicated and ask him to submit to a blood sample to check his blood alcohol concentration c) Relieve the physician of duty and alert the hospital's patient safety officer d) Tell the physician that you can cover the remainder of the shift alone, so that he can sleep in his office 
Output:
First, I need to assess the situation and the physician's behavior. The physician appears tired and disheveled, and there is an odor of alcohol on his breath. However, he is a skilled and talented physician with no known history of substance or alcohol use disorder.
Next, I need to consider the potential risks to patient safety. If the physician is indeed intoxicated, he may not be able to perform his duties safely, which could put patients at risk.
Now, I need to determine the most appropriate course of action. Option a) is not appropriate because it does not address the potential risk to patient safety. Option d) is also not appropriate because it does not address the potential risk to patient safety and may not be in the best interest of the physician.
Option b) is not the most appropriate next step because it may be seen as accusatory and may not be necessary if the physician is not actually intoxicated. Option c) is the most appropriate next step because it prioritizes patient safety and allows for a thorough investigation into the situation.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: A 22-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He feels well. He has had a painless left scrotal mass since childhood. Examination shows a 6-cm, soft, nontender left scrotal mass that transilluminates; there are no bowel sounds in the mass. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass? Choices: a) Accumulation of scrotal adipose tissue b) Cryptorchidism of the left testis c) Dilation of the pampiniform plexus of veins around the testis d) Persistence of a patent processus vaginalis 
Output:
First, I need to consider the characteristics of the mass. It is a painless, soft, nontender mass that transilluminates. This suggests that the mass is filled with fluid.
Next, I need to consider the location of the mass. It is located in the scrotum, which is the sac that contains the testes.
Now, I need to consider the possible causes of the mass. Option a) Accumulation of scrotal adipose tissue is unlikely because the mass is filled with fluid, not fat. Option b) Cryptorchidism of the left testis is unlikely because the examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Option c) Dilation of the pampiniform plexus of veins around the testis is unlikely because the mass is filled with fluid, not blood. Option d) Persistence of a patent processus vaginalis is the most likely cause because it would allow fluid to accumulate in the scrotum, creating a mass that transilluminates.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 3-year-old boy with chronic granulomatous disease is brought to the physician because of a 3-week history of fever and warm, red lumps under both arms. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F). Physical examination shows enlarged, 3-cm, erythematous axillary lymph nodes bilaterally. On palpation, the nodes are tender, fluctuant, and movable. Examination of a fine-needle aspirate from one of the nodes shows gram-positive cocci in clusters. Cultures of the aspirate grow yellow, βhemolytic colonies that are catalase and coagulase positive. A polymerase chain reaction test shows mecA-positive organisms. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient? Choices: a) Ciprofloxacin b) Penicillin G c) Rifampin d) Vancomycin 
Output:
First, I need to identify the type of infection. The patient has a 3-week history of fever and warm, red lumps under both arms, and the physical examination shows enlarged, tender, fluctuant, and movable axillary lymph nodes. The fine-needle aspirate shows gram-positive cocci in clusters, and the cultures grow yellow, β-hemolytic colonies that are catalase and coagulase positive. The polymerase chain reaction test shows mecA-positive organisms. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection.
Next, I need to consider the appropriate pharmacotherapy for MRSA infection. MRSA is resistant to many antibiotics, including penicillin G and ciprofloxacin. Rifampin is sometimes used as adjunctive therapy for MRSA, but it is not typically used as monotherapy.
Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is vancomycin, which is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is effective against MRSA. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 35-year-old man with spina bifida is admitted to the hospital for a urologic procedure. He has been functionally independent in activities of daily living and is employed doing inventory control in a local sporting goods store. He has maintained continence through periodic self-catheterization. The patient is paraplegic, has recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stones, and recent onset of incontinence secondary to detrusor and bladder neck dysfunction. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows a well-developed, well-nourished man in no acute distress. Aside from paraplegia, lower extremity muscle atrophy, and lower abdominal surgical scars, the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. He had an episode of anaphylaxis secondary to latex allergy during a previous operation for functional expansion of his bladder through a bowel anastomosis. Which of the following is most important to consider in the care of this patient? Choices: a) Administration of injectable medications with disposable syringes b) Preparation of food by outside contractors c) Type of cleaning agents used to sterilize bed linens d) Use of rubber urethral catheters 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's history of anaphylaxis secondary to latex allergy. This is a life-threatening condition that requires careful consideration in the patient's care.
Next, I need to think about the potential sources of latex exposure in the hospital setting. Latex is commonly used in medical equipment, including gloves, catheters, and other devices.
Now, I need to consider the options provided and determine which one is most important to consider in the care of this patient. Option d) Use of rubber urethral catheters is the most important consideration, as latex is a common component of these catheters and the patient has a known allergy.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 6-month-old male Hispanic infant is brought to the office by his parents because of intermittent swelling of his right scrotum that is more pronounced when he cries. The swelling has never been red or ""stuck."" Vital signs are normal. A right inguinal hernia is confirmed on physical examination. In discussing repair of the hernia with the parents, it is most appropriate to inform them of which of the following? Choices: a) Herniorrhaphy can be postponed until age 2 years because many hernias close spontaneously b) Herniorrhaphy can be postponed until age 12 years because oligospermia does not develop before age 12 c) Herniorrhaphy should be scheduled at the earliest convenient time d) Herniorrhaphy should be scheduled as an emergency operation 
Output:
First, I need to consider the age of the patient. The patient is 6 months old, which is a common age for infants to be diagnosed with inguinal hernias.
Next, I need to consider the risks associated with hernia repair. Hernia repair is generally considered safe and effective, and it is recommended to repair hernias in infants before they can cause complications.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a is incorrect because hernias in infants do not typically close spontaneously. Option b is incorrect because there is no evidence that hernia repair affects sperm count. Option d is incorrect because hernia repair is not typically considered an emergency operation.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician because of dizziness for 6 weeks. When she stands up suddenly, she becomes light-headed and has to steady herself for approximately 1 to 2 minutes before she is able to walk. She has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include glyburide, a diuretic, a β-adrenergic blocking agent, and an angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Her pulse is 55/min. Her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg in the right arm and 70/50 mm Hg in the left arm while supine; her blood pressure is 70/50 mm Hg in the right arm and 50/30 mm Hg in the left arm immediately after standing. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. An ECG shows sinus bradycardia with no evidence of ischemia. Carotid duplex ultrasonography shows reverse flow in the left vertebral artery with no evidence of occlusion. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Choices: a) Cardiac stress scintigraphy b) Adjusting her medication regimen c) Warfarin therapy d) Transesophageal echocardiography 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's symptoms and the potential causes. The patient is experiencing dizziness and lightheadedness when standing up suddenly, which suggests orthostatic hypotension.
Next, I need to consider the patient's medical history and current medications. The patient has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus and is taking several medications, including a diuretic, a β-adrenergic blocking agent, and an ACE inhibitor. These medications can contribute to orthostatic hypotension.
Now, I need to consider the patient's test results. The ECG shows sinus bradycardia, but no evidence of ischemia. The carotid duplex ultrasonography shows reverse flow in the left vertebral artery, but no evidence of occlusion. This suggests that the patient's symptoms are not due to a cardiac cause, but rather due to a vasovagal response or a medication side effect.
Based on this information, the most appropriate next step in management is to adjust the patient's medication regimen to minimize the risk of orthostatic hypotension. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 17-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because she has not had a menstrual period for 6 months. The patient is unconcerned about the lack of menses. Menarche occurred at the age of 12 years, and menses had occurred at regular 28-day intervals until they became irregular 1 year ago. She is a member of her high school gymnastics team. She appears emaciated. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 40 kg (88 lb); BMI is 15 kg/m2. Her pulse is 54/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's amenorrhea? Choices: a) Hyperthyroidism b) Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism c) Hypothyroidism d) Polycystic ovarian syndrome 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and history. The patient is a 17-year-old girl who has not had a menstrual period for 6 months, and she appears emaciated. She is a member of her high school gymnastics team, which suggests that she may be underweight or malnourished.
Next, I need to consider the patient's physical characteristics. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 40 kg (88 lb), which gives her a BMI of 15 kg/m2. This is below the normal range, indicating that she is underweight.
Now, I need to consider the patient's vital signs. Her pulse is 54/min, which is lower than the normal range, and her blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg, which is lower than the normal range. These findings suggest that she may be experiencing a decrease in cardiac output or a decrease in blood volume.
Considering the patient's symptoms, physical characteristics, and vital signs, the most likely cause of her amenorrhea is hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is a condition characterized by a decrease in the production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and, as a result, a decrease in the production of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This condition is often seen in individuals who are underweight or malnourished, such as athletes or individuals with eating disorders.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. He was delivered at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy. His birth weight was 3500 g (7 lb 11 oz), and Apgar scores were 8 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. At the age of 15 months, physical examination showed no abnormalities, but he was not yet talking. Both of his parents had learning difficulties in school, and his mother stopped attending after the 10th grade. He has a maternal uncle with cognitive disabilities. He is at the 25th percentile for height, 15th percentile for weight, and 90th percentile for head circumference. He appears irritable, he resists making eye contact, and he is flapping his hands. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition? Choices: a) Frameshift mutation b) Missense mutation c) Nonsense mutation d) Trinucleotide repeat expansion 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key features of the patient's condition. The patient is a 2-year-old boy who is not yet talking, has a family history of learning difficulties and cognitive disabilities, and exhibits signs of irritability, resistance to eye contact, and hand flapping.
Next, I need to consider the possible genetic causes of these symptoms. The patient's family history and physical examination suggest a possible genetic disorder.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. A frameshift mutation, missense mutation, and nonsense mutation are all types of point mutations that can cause genetic disorders, but they are not typically associated with a family history of learning difficulties and cognitive disabilities.
A trinucleotide repeat expansion, on the other hand, is a type of genetic mutation that can cause a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder. This type of mutation is often associated with a family history of learning difficulties and cognitive disabilities.
Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a trinucleotide repeat expansion, which is associated with autism spectrum disorder. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

He and his wife have been unable to conceive because of his low sperm count. Scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation. Spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis? Choices: a) Arterial blood gas analysis b) Examination of sputum for eosinophils c) Sweat chloride test d) Sputum cytology 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms and signs presented in the case. The patient has had frequent upper respiratory tract infections, daily purulent sputum, decreased exercise tolerance, and low sperm count. He also has scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi throughout both lung fields, and a chest x-ray shows hyperinflation. Spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these symptoms and signs. The patient's symptoms and signs are suggestive of a chronic respiratory disease.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Option a) Arterial blood gas analysis may show abnormalities in patients with chronic respiratory disease, but it is not specific for any particular disease. Option b) Examination of sputum for eosinophils is more typical of asthma or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Option c) Sweat chloride test is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis, which is a chronic respiratory disease that can cause the symptoms and signs presented in the case. Option d) Sputum cytology may be used to diagnose lung cancer or other conditions, but it is not the best choice for this case.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 37-year-old woman with right lower extremity edema is evaluated because of the sudden onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is made. Which of the following signs, if present on physical examination, would be the most specific indicator of pulmonary arterial hypertension in this patient? Choices: a) Increased jugular venous pressure b) P2 louder than A2 c) Peripheral edema d) Presence of an S3 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key symptoms and the diagnosis. The patient has a pulmonary embolism and symptoms of shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain.
Next, I need to consider the possible complications of pulmonary embolism. One possible complication is pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which is characterized by high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries.
Now, I need to consider the physical examination signs that are associated with PAH. The most specific indicator of PAH is a loud P2 heart sound, which is caused by the increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 32-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 41 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. Pregnancy has been complicated by mild asthma treated with inhaled bronchodilators. At the beginning of the second stage of labor, the cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated; the vertex is at -1 station. The fetal heart rate is reactive with no decelerations. After 10 minutes of pushing, there is a prolonged deceleration to 60/min. The patient has the acute onset of shortness of breath, rapidly develops cyanosis, and becomes unresponsive. Her pulse and blood pressure cannot be detected. Immediate resuscitation is started. Five minutes later, there is bleeding from the nose, mouth, and intravenous sites. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Choices: a) Amniotic fluid embolism b) Intracerebral hemorrhage c) Myocardial infarction d) Status asmaticus 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key symptoms presented in the scenario. The patient is a 32-year-old woman in active labor, with a history of mild asthma. She develops a prolonged deceleration in the fetal heart rate, followed by acute onset of shortness of breath, cyanosis, and unresponsiveness. She also experiences bleeding from the nose, mouth, and intravenous sites.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these symptoms. The patient's history of asthma and the development of shortness of breath and cyanosis suggest a respiratory issue. However, the bleeding from the nose, mouth, and intravenous sites is a critical clue, as it suggests a systemic issue.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a known complication of labor, particularly in patients with a history of asthma. AFE can cause respiratory distress, cyanosis, and bleeding due to the release of histamine and other mediators. Intracerebral hemorrhage and myocardial infarction are less likely, as they would not typically cause bleeding from multiple sites. Status asthmaticus is also unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are more severe and systemic than typical asthma exacerbation.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 52-year-old man is admitted to the hospital because of severe dyspnea and cough productive of tenacious, brownishyellow sputum for the past 3 weeks. He has a 15-year career history of sandblasting old buildings. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. The patient is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m2. Vital signs are temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse 94/min, and blood pressure 150/92 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 70%. On physical examination he is in moderately severe distress with pursed lips and cyanotic nail beds. Chest has an increased anteroposterior diameter. Auscultation of the chest discloses scattered wheezes and rhonchi over all lung fields. Cardiac examination discloses muffled heart sounds and an S4. Fingers are clubbed. Chest x-ray shows hyperinflated lungs, flattened diaphragm, large, irregular opacities in the upper lobes, and eggshell calcifications of the hilar lymph nodes. In addition to antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate intervention? Choices: a) Azathioprine therapy b) Bronchoscopy c) Continuous humidified oxygen d) Nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's condition. The patient has severe dyspnea, cough productive of tenacious, brownish-yellow sputum, and a history of sandblasting old buildings, which suggests chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as pursed lips, cyanotic nail beds, and clubbed fingers, are consistent with COPD.
Next, I need to consider the patient's oxygen saturation of 70% on room air, which indicates severe hypoxemia. The patient's condition requires immediate intervention to improve oxygenation.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Azathioprine therapy is used to treat autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and is not indicated for COPD. Bronchoscopy may be useful in diagnosing lung cancer or other conditions, but it is not the most appropriate intervention for this patient. Nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is used to treat obstructive sleep apnea, which is not the primary diagnosis in this case.
Therefore, the most appropriate intervention is continuous humidified oxygen to improve the patient's oxygen saturation and alleviate hypoxemia. The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: A 32-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 8 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for her first prenatal visit. She delivered her first child spontaneously at 34 weeks' gestation; pregnancy was complicated by iron deficiency anemia. She has no other history of serious illness. Her blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. Examination shows no abnormalities. Ultrasonography shows a dichorionic-diamniotic twin intrauterine pregnancy consistent in size with an 8-week gestation. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following complications? Choices: a) Abruptio placentae b) Fetal chromosome abnormality c) Hyperthyroidism d) Preterm labor and delivery 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's history of complications. The patient had a previous pregnancy complicated by iron deficiency anemia.
Next, I need to consider the patient's current pregnancy. The patient is now pregnant with twins, and the previous pregnancy was complicated by iron deficiency anemia.
Considering the patient's history and current pregnancy, I need to determine which complication is most likely. Iron deficiency anemia is associated with preterm labor and delivery.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 46-year-old woman with active ankylosing spondylitis comes to the office for a follow-up examination. The use of various conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been ineffective. Sulfasalazine treatment also has not resulted in improvement. The most appropriate next step in treatment is administration of a drug that inhibits which of the following? Choices: a) Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 b) Epidermal growth factor c) Interleukin-1 (IL-1) d) Tumor necrosis factor α 
Output:
First, I need to identify the disease. The patient has active ankylosing spondylitis, which is a type of arthritis that primarily affects the spine, although other joints can also be involved.
Next, I need to consider the treatment options. The patient has already tried conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and sulfasalazine, which are commonly used to treat ankylosing spondylitis, but they have been ineffective.
The next step in treatment would be to consider biologic agents, which are a type of medication that targets specific molecules involved in the inflammatory process.
The correct answer is the molecule that is most closely associated with the pathophysiology of ankylosing spondylitis. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) is a cytokine that plays a key role in the inflammatory process and is a primary target for biologic agents in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

After 5 minutes, his pulse is 130/min, and blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg. Examination shows a 2-cm wound at the left sixth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. There is jugular venous distention. Breath sounds are normal. The trachea is at the midline. Heart sounds are not audible. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Choices: a) Chest x-ray b) Echocardiography c) Bronchoscopy d) Pericardiocentesis 
Output:
First, I need to assess the patient's condition. The patient is unresponsive, has a high pulse rate, low blood pressure, and shallow breathing, which indicates shock.
Next, I need to identify the cause of the shock. The patient has a stab wound to the chest, which could have caused bleeding or damage to the heart or lungs.
Now, I need to determine the best course of action. The patient's jugular venous distention and inaudible heart sounds suggest that the heart is not functioning properly, which could be due to bleeding or a cardiac tamponade.
Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform a pericardiocentesis to drain the fluid that may be accumulating in the pericardial sac and relieve the pressure on the heart.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 55-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a 2-day history of severe epigastric pain and vomiting. Past medical history is negative for any similar episodes. He does not take any medications. He smokes cigarettes, has a 40 pack-year history, and consumes more than 8 cans of beer per day. Abdominal examination reveals epigastric tenderness. Laboratory studies reveal a serum amylase level of 467 U/L (reference range: 28-100 U/L) and a γ-glutamyltransferase level of 212 U/L (reference range: < 55 U/L). Referred pain in this patient is transmitted to the spinal cord by which of the following nerves?

"Input: An epidemic involving 10 individuals of all ages occurs in a migrant worker camp. None of the patients has had any form of immunization. Most cases present with fever, chills, tachypnea, sore throat, swollen glands, and severe malaise. One patient dies from respiratory complications, and another dies from myocardial involvement. A gram-positive rod is isolated from the respiratory tracts of 7 of the patients. The most likely cause of the outbreak is Choices: a) Bordetella pertussis b) Corynebacterium diphtheriae c) Epstein-Barr virus d) Haemophilus influenzae 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key characteristics of the disease. The patients present with fever, chills, tachypnea, sore throat, swollen glands, and severe malaise.
Next, I need to consider the fact that a gram-positive rod is isolated from the respiratory tracts of 7 of the patients. This suggests that the disease is caused by a bacterial infection.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Bordetella pertussis is the cause of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, which is characterized by a distinctive cough. However, the symptoms described in the question do not match those of pertussis. Corynebacterium diphtheriae is the cause of diphtheria, which is characterized by a sore throat and a membrane that forms in the throat. However, the question does not mention a membrane. Epstein-Barr virus is the cause of infectious mononucleosis, which is characterized by fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph nodes. However, the question does not mention swollen lymph nodes. Haemophilus influenzae is a gram-negative rod, not a gram-positive rod, so it is unlikely to be the cause of the outbreak.

The patient's symptoms are not severe enough to meet the criteria for a major depressive disorder, and there is no indication of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. The patient's symptoms are also not persistent enough to meet the criteria for generalized anxiety disorder.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is adjustment disorder with anxious mood, which is characterized by the development of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor, such as a recent relocation. {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A new blood test to detect prostate cancer is evaluated in 300 male volunteers. A needle biopsy of the prostate gland is done on all men with serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations greater than 5 ng/mL (N<4). One hundred men undergo biopsy procedures; 90 are found to have prostate cancer, and five are found to have chronic prostatitis. Which of the following is necessary to calculate the sensitivity of this test? Choices: a) Incidence of chronic prostatitis in the general population b) Number of men with test results greater than 5 ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen c) Prevalence of chronic prostatitis in the general population d) Prostate biopsies of men with test results equal to or below 5 ng/mL 
Output:
First, I need to understand what sensitivity means in the context of this test. Sensitivity is the proportion of true positive results among all actual positives. In other words, it is the number of people with the disease who are correctly identified by the test.
To calculate the sensitivity of this test, I need to know the number of men with prostate cancer who are correctly identified by the test. This means I need to know the number of men with prostate cancer who have a test result greater than 5 ng/mL.
From the information given, I know that 90 men with prostate cancer underwent biopsy procedures, and all of them had test results greater than 5 ng/mL. This means that all 90 men with prostate cancer were correctly identified by the test.
However, I also need to know the total number of men with prostate cancer who underwent biopsy procedures. This is not given in the information, but it is not necessary to calculate the sensitivity of the test. The sensitivity of the test is the proportion of true positive results among all actual positives, and I already know the number of true positive results (90) and the number of actual positives (90).
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 55-year-old man who is a business executive is admitted to the hospital for evaluation of abdominal pain. He is polite to the physician but berates the nurses and other staff. The patient's wife and two of his three adult children arrive for a visit. The patient says with disgust that the missing child is and always has been worthless. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's behavior? Choices: a) Projection b) Projective identification c) Reaction formation d) Splitting 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the situation. The patient is admitted to the hospital for evaluation of abdominal pain, but his behavior is more focused on his family dynamics.
The patient is polite to the physician but berates the nurses and other staff. This suggests that he may be using his behavior to express his feelings in a way that is not directly related to the situation at hand.
The patient's wife and two of his three adult children arrive for a visit, and he says with disgust that the missing child is and always has been worthless. This statement is a clear expression of his feelings towards his child, but it is also a way of expressing his own feelings in a way that is not directly related to the situation.
Considering the options, I think the most likely explanation for this patient's behavior is d) Splitting. Splitting is a defense mechanism in which an individual separates their feelings and thoughts into two categories, usually good and bad, and attributes them to different people or objects. In this case, the patient is splitting his feelings towards his child, viewing them as worthless, and attributing those feelings to his child rather than acknowledging them as his own.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A previously healthy 37-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of episodes of severe anxiety, shortness of breath, palpitations, and numbness in her hands and feet. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Thyroid function studies and an ECG show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? Choices: a) Lithium carbonate b) Methylphenidate c) Olanzapine d) Paroxetine 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms presented by the patient. The patient has episodes of severe anxiety, shortness of breath, palpitations, and numbness in her hands and feet.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these symptoms. The symptoms could be related to a variety of conditions, including anxiety disorders, cardiovascular disease, or neurological disorders.
However, the patient's thyroid function studies and ECG are normal, which makes thyroid disease and cardiac disease less likely.
The patient's symptoms are most consistent with a diagnosis of panic disorder, which is characterized by recurrent panic attacks.
The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for panic disorder is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), such as paroxetine.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: An investigator is studying the incidence of the common cold among medical students at various time points during the school year. Results show an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections among these students during finals week. It is hypothesized that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection. Which of the following laboratory findings in these students during examination week is most likely to support this hypothesis? Choices: a) Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration b) Decreased macrophage activity c) Increased basophil count d) Increased lymphocyte count 
Output:
First, I need to understand the hypothesis that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection.
Next, I need to consider how stress affects the immune system. Stress is known to suppress the immune system, which can make people more susceptible to infections.
Now, I need to consider the laboratory findings that would support this hypothesis. A decreased macrophage activity would be consistent with the hypothesis, as macrophages are a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in the immune system. If the stress of studying for examinations suppresses the immune system, it would be expected to decrease macrophage activity.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 30-year-old nulliparous female presents to the office with the complaint of mood changes. She says that for the past several months she has been anxious, hyperactive, and unable to sleep 3 to 4 days prior to the onset of menses. She further reports that on the day her menses begins she becomes acutely depressed, anorectic, irritable, and lethargic. She has no psychiatric history. Physical examination findings are normal. She and her husband have been trying to conceive for over 2 years. History reveals a tuboplasty approximately 1 year ago to correct a closed fallopian tube. The most likely diagnosis is Choices: a) adjustment disorder with depressed mood b) bipolar I disorder, mixed c) cyclothymic personality d) generalized anxiety disorder 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key symptoms presented by the patient. The patient reports mood changes, anxiety, hyperactivity, insomnia, depression, anorexia, irritability, and lethargy.
Next, I need to consider the timing of the symptoms. The patient reports that these symptoms occur 3 to 4 days prior to the onset of menses and then resolve once menses begins.
The patient's symptoms seem to be closely tied to her menstrual cycle, which suggests a possible hormonal component to her condition.
Considering the options, I can rule out adjustment disorder with depressed mood (a) because the patient's symptoms are not a response to a stressor, and they are closely tied to her menstrual cycle.
I can also rule out bipolar I disorder, mixed (b) because the patient does not report manic or hypomanic episodes.
Cyclothymic personality (c) is not a valid diagnosis, as it is not a recognized psychiatric disorder.
Generalized anxiety disorder (d) is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms seem to be more closely tied to her menstrual cycle than to a general anxiety disorder.
However, the patient's symptoms are most consistent with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which is a condition characterized by mood changes, anxiety, and other symptoms that occur in the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle. PMDD is not listed as an option, but it is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and history.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 19-year-old college student comes to the physician because of vaginal irritation and pain with urination for 5 days. Two weeks ago, she had streptococcal pharyngitis treated with amoxicillin. She has been sexually active with two partners over the past year; she uses condoms for contraception. Her last menstrual period was 1 week ago. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows erythema of the vulva and vagina and a thick white vaginal discharge. The pH of the discharge is 4. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings? Choices: a) Bacterial vaginosis b) Candidiasis c) Chlamydia trachomatis infection d) Escherichia coli infection 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient has vaginal irritation and pain with urination, which suggests a vaginal infection.
Next, I need to consider the patient's sexual history. The patient has been sexually active with two partners over the past year, which increases her risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
Now, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and the results of the pelvic examination. The patient has erythema of the vulva and vagina and a thick white vaginal discharge, which is consistent with a yeast infection.
The pH of the discharge is 4, which is consistent with a yeast infection. Candidiasis is a yeast infection caused by Candida albicans, and it is a common cause of vaginal infections in sexually active women.
Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is Candidiasis, which is choice b) Candidiasis.

"Input: A sexually active 23-year-old man with multiple sex partners has dysuria and a yellow urethral exudate. Gram stain of the exudate shows numerous neutrophils, many that contain intracellular gram-negative diplococci. He has had three similar episodes of urethritis over the past 2 years. Which of the following properties of the infecting organism best explains the reinfection? Choices: a) Antigenic variation b) Catalase c) Inhibition of B-lymphocyte function d) Inhibition of T-lymphocyte function 
Output:
First, I need to identify the type of bacteria that is causing the infection. The presence of intracellular gram-negative diplococci is characteristic of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
Next, I need to consider the properties of the infecting organism that could explain the reinfection. The fact that the patient has had multiple episodes of urethritis suggests that the organism is able to evade the immune system.
Antigenic variation refers to the ability of an organism to change its surface antigens, making it difficult for the immune system to recognize and respond to it. This is a common mechanism of reinfection for Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
Catalase is an enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide, and its presence or absence is not directly related to the ability of an organism to evade the immune system.
Inhibition of B-lymphocyte function would make it difficult for the immune system to produce antibodies against the organism, but it would not explain the reinfection.
Inhibition of T-lymphocyte function would make it difficult for the immune system to mount a cell-mediated response against the organism, but it would not explain the reinfection.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 54-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe jaw pain since undergoing a painful dental procedure 1 day ago. The patient was prescribed codeine after the procedure and instructed to take the medication every 4 hours, but she has continued pain despite adherence to this analgesic regimen. Other members of her family also have experienced poor pain control with codeine. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this therapeutic failure? Choices: a) Decreased absorption of codeine b) Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine c) Deficiency of κ receptors d) Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's history of poor pain control with codeine. This suggests that the patient may have a genetic variation that affects the metabolism of codeine.
Codeine is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP2D6 to morphine, which is the active ingredient responsible for pain relief. Some people have a genetic variation that results in decreased activity of this enzyme, leading to reduced conversion of codeine to morphine.
This is known as a poor metabolizer phenotype, which can result in therapeutic failure of codeine for pain relief.
Therefore, the most likely explanation for this therapeutic failure is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A healthy 4-year-old girl is brought for a well-child examination. A grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper left sternal border. S2 is widely split and does not vary with respiration. A soft mid-diastolic murmur is heard along the lower left sternal border. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Choices: a) Aortic stenosis b) Atrial septal defect c) Coarctation of the aorta d) Mitral valve prolapse 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key findings from the physical examination. The girl has a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border, which suggests a possible issue with the aortic valve.
Next, I need to consider the split S2 and its implications. A widely split S2 that does not vary with respiration is often associated with an atrial septal defect (ASD), as it indicates a fixed delay in the closure of the pulmonary valve.
Now, I need to consider the soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border. This finding is often associated with mitral valve prolapse, but in the context of the other findings, it is less likely.
Considering all the findings, the most likely diagnosis is an atrial septal defect (ASD), as it explains the widely split S2 and the presence of a systolic ejection murmur.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 75-year-old woman comes to the office because she has band-like, burning pain in her right upper abdomen extending from the epigastrium around to the midline of the back. Physical examination discloses no abdominal tenderness to palpation. Findings on ultrasonography of the gallbladder are normal. Serum amylase concentration is within the reference range. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Choices: a) Acalculous cholecystitis b) Chronic relapsing pancreatitis c) Diverticulitis of the cecum d) Herpes zoster 
Output:
First, I need to consider the symptoms described. The woman has band-like, burning pain in her right upper abdomen extending from the epigastrium around to the midline of the back.
Next, I need to consider the physical examination findings. There is no abdominal tenderness to palpation, which suggests that the pain is not due to inflammation or irritation of the abdominal organs.
Now, I need to consider the ultrasonography findings. The gallbladder is normal, which makes acalculous cholecystitis (choice a) less likely.
I also need to consider the serum amylase concentration. It is within the reference range, which makes chronic relapsing pancreatitis (choice b) less likely.
Considering the location of the pain and the lack of abdominal tenderness, I think the most likely diagnosis is diverticulitis of the cecum (choice c).
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: A 36-year-old man comes to the office because of headaches that began 2 weeks ago. The headaches are moderately severe, are present when he awakens in the morning, and are relieved with over-the-counter analgesics. He has no prior history of headaches. He tells you he was promoted to an upper-level managerial position in his accounting firm about 8 months ago, which necessitated relocating. Physical examination now discloses no abnormalities except for blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step? Choices: a) Begin a trial of a β-blocking medication b) Order CT scan of the head c) Order EEG d) Refer him for consultation with a neurologist 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and history. The patient is experiencing headaches that began 2 weeks ago, are moderately severe, and are relieved with over-the-counter analgesics. He has no prior history of headaches.
Next, I need to consider the patient's physical examination findings. The physical examination discloses blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally.
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, I suspect that the patient may have a condition called cluster headaches. Cluster headaches are a type of headache disorder that is characterized by recurrent, severe headaches that occur in clusters or cycles.
The most appropriate next step would be to begin a trial of a β-blocking medication. β-blocking medications, such as propranolol, are often used to treat cluster headaches.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 15-year-old girl comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of acne. Breast and pubic hair development began at the age of 12 years. Menarche occurred at the age of 14 years. Physical examination shows scattered open and closed comedones over the cheeks and forehead. Breast and pubic hair development are Tanner stage 5. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's acne? Choices: a) Increased estrogen stimulation of the sebaceous glands b) Increased responsiveness of the sebaceous glands to follicle-stimulating hormone c) Increased sympathetic stimulation to the sebaceous glands d) Stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's age and the timing of her symptoms. The patient is 15 years old and has a 3-month history of acne. She also has Tanner stage 5 breast and pubic hair development, which indicates that she has completed puberty.
Next, I need to consider the patient's menstrual history. Menarche occurred at the age of 14 years, which is within the normal range.
Now, I need to consider the patient's physical examination. The patient has scattered open and closed comedones over the cheeks and forehead, which is consistent with acne.
Given the patient's age, menstrual history, and physical examination, the most likely underlying cause of her acne is increased androgen stimulation of the sebaceous glands. This is because androgens are known to stimulate the sebaceous glands and contribute to the development of acne.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 19-year-old Asian female college student comes to the university health center because of a 1-week history of nasal stuffiness, occasional clear rhinorrhea, and a mild sore throat. Two days ago, she began to feel hot, but she has not taken her temperature. Medical history is unremarkable and her only medication is an oral contraceptive. She has no history of allergies. She does not smoke cigarettes. BMI is 22 kg/m2. Vital signs are temperature 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse 88/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 116/74 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses tenderness over the left maxillary sinus without purulent drainage. There is clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane, enlarged tonsils bilaterally, and pain with tapping of the left upper incisors. Left frontal sinus does not transilluminate. Cardiopulmonary examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's sinusitis? Choices: a) Eustachian tube dysfunction b) Mucosal edema c) Nasal polyps d) Oral contraceptive use 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has a 1-week history of nasal stuffiness, occasional clear rhinorrhea, and a mild sore throat, which suggests a viral upper respiratory tract infection.
The patient also has a fever, which is consistent with an infection.
The physical examination findings, including tenderness over the left maxillary sinus, clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane, enlarged tonsils, and pain with tapping of the left upper incisors, suggest sinusitis.
The patient's age, sex, and medical history are also relevant. The patient is a young adult, and the symptoms are consistent with a viral upper respiratory tract infection.
Considering the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's sinusitis is Eustachian tube dysfunction. This is because the Eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the back of the nose and throat, and dysfunction of this tube can lead to sinusitis.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: A randomized controlled trial is conducted to assess the effectiveness of a new combination-drug antihypertensive therapy (Drug X) compared with a standard antihypertensive single-drug therapy. Study participants include 140 women (70%) and 60 men (30%) ages 30 to 60 years, with baseline blood pressure measurements of 150/95 mm Hg or higher. The investigators defined antihypertensive therapy as effective if the treatment resulted in a blood pressure measurement below 140/90 mm Hg. When designing the study, the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1%; they set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%. Which of the following is the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study? Choices: a) 1% b) 10% c) 40% d) 90% 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the problem. The study is a randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of a new combination-drug antihypertensive therapy (Drug X) with a standard antihypertensive single-drug therapy.
The investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1% (Type I error) and the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10% (Type II error).
The statistical power of a study is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. In this case, the null hypothesis is that the two drugs have the same effectiveness.
Given the Type II error rate of 10%, the statistical power of the study is 1 - 0.10 = 0.90, or 90%.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 62-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of progressive fatigue and ankle swelling. He had an anterior myocardial infarction 3 years ago and has had shortness of breath with mild exertion since then. Current medications include labetalol and daily aspirin. He has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. His pulse is 100/min and regular, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. There are jugular venous pulsations 5 cm above the sternal angle. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows an S3 gallop. There is edema from the midtibia to the ankle bilaterally. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings? Choices: a) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure b) Impaired contractility of the left ventricle c) Prolapse of the mitral valve d) Thrombosis of the superior vena cava 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient has progressive fatigue and ankle swelling, which are symptoms of heart failure. He also has a history of anterior myocardial infarction and shortness of breath with mild exertion, which suggests that he has had damage to his heart muscle.
Next, I need to consider the patient's physical examination findings. The patient has jugular venous pulsations 5 cm above the sternal angle, which indicates elevated right atrial pressure. He also has crackles at both lung bases, which suggests pulmonary congestion. The S3 gallop is a sign of increased volume in the ventricle, and the edema from the midtibia to the ankle bilaterally suggests fluid overload.
Based on these findings, the patient is most likely to have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which is characterized by impaired diastolic function and elevated left ventricular filling pressures. Therefore, the patient is most likely to have impaired contractility of the left ventricle, which is choice b.

"Input: A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of persistent nonproductive cough for 6 weeks. She has not had fever or weight loss. She has hypertension treated with enalapril for the past 3 months. She does not smoke. There is no history of lung disease. She weighs 54 kg (120 lb) and is 163 cm (64 in) tall. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination and an x-ray of the chest show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of this patient's cough? Choices: a) Decreased plasma renin activity b) Decreased serum angiotensin II concentrations c) Increased serum angiotensin I concentrations d) Increased serum bradykinin concentrations 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient has a persistent nonproductive cough for 6 weeks, but no fever or weight loss. She has hypertension treated with enalapril for the past 3 months.
Next, I need to consider the potential side effects of enalapril. Enalapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which is used to treat hypertension. One of the known side effects of ACE inhibitors is a persistent cough.
Now, I need to consider the mechanism of the cough. ACE inhibitors work by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor. However, ACE also breaks down bradykinin, a peptide that causes blood vessels to dilate. By blocking the breakdown of bradykinin, ACE inhibitors can increase its levels, leading to increased bradykinin concentrations.
Therefore, the most likely mechanism of the patient's cough is increased serum bradykinin concentrations. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 6-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department 2 hours after injuring his arm when he fell out of a tree. His mother says that he is extremely active and likes to climb. During the past year, he fractured his right tibia after falling off a trampoline and sustained a concussion after falling off his bicycle. She says that his teachers reprimand him frequently for running wildly in the classroom, talking excessively, and getting out of his seat; he often forgets to turn in his homework. His parents are currently divorcing. His father has a history of illicit drug use. The patient is at the 50th percentile for height and weight. His pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 100/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a dislocated left shoulder, healing abrasions over the elbows, and ecchymoses in various stages of healing over the knees. Mental status examination shows a neutral affect. He says that he likes to run and climb trees. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings? Choices: a) Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder b) Conduct disorder c) Learning disorder d) Seizure disorder 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key findings in the case. The patient is a 6-year-old boy who has a history of injuries, including a fractured tibia, concussion, and dislocated shoulder. He also has a history of behavioral problems, including running wildly in the classroom, talking excessively, and getting out of his seat. His parents are currently divorcing, and his father has a history of illicit drug use.
Next, I need to consider the possible explanations for these findings. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a condition characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The patient's history of injuries and behavioral problems, as well as his physical examination findings, suggest that he may have ADHD. Conduct disorder is a condition characterized by a pattern of behavior that violates the rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules. While the patient's behavior is problematic, it does not appear to be as severe as conduct disorder. Learning disorder is a condition characterized by difficulties with learning and academic achievement. There is no indication in the case that the patient has a learning disorder. Seizure disorder is a condition characterized by recurrent seizures. There is no indication in the case that the patient has a seizure disorder.
Therefore, the most likely explanation for these findings is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 49-year-old man, who is recovering in the hospital 2 days after uncomplicated left femoral-popliteal bypass grafting for claudication, has now developed increasing pain in his left foot. Until now, the patient's postoperative course had been unremarkable and he has been treated with low-dose morphine for pain control. Medical history is remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin and diet. Vital signs now are temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse 80/min and regular, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 150/92 mm Hg. The surgical incision appears clean and well approximated without abnormal erythema or swelling. The left lower extremity and foot appear pale. Palpation of the left lower extremity discloses a strong femoral pulse, a weak popliteal pulse, and a cool, pulseless foot. Which of the following is the most appropriate management? Choices: a) Bedside compartment pressure measurements b) Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity c) Intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy d) Intraoperative angiography 
Output:
First, I need to assess the patient's condition. The patient has developed increasing pain in his left foot, which is pale and pulseless. The surgical incision appears clean, but the left lower extremity and foot appear pale. Palpation of the left lower extremity discloses a strong femoral pulse, a weak popliteal pulse, and a cool, pulseless foot.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of the patient's condition. The patient has undergone a left femoral-popliteal bypass grafting, which suggests that the patient has a history of peripheral artery disease. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with acute limb ischemia.
Now, I need to determine the most appropriate management. The patient requires immediate intervention to restore blood flow to the affected limb. Intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy is a treatment option for acute limb ischemia, particularly in patients with a history of peripheral artery disease. It involves the administration of tPA directly into the affected artery to dissolve the clot and restore blood flow.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 9-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive weakness and a purple-red discoloration over his cheeks and upper eyelids over the past 8 weeks. His symptoms began shortly after a camping trip, and he now is unable to climb stairs, walk long distances, comb his hair, or dress himself. His mother says that she was careful to apply his sunscreen on the trip and can recall no tick bites or exposure to poisonous plants. His only medication is a topical corticosteroid for several dry, scaly patches of the skin. He appears weak and lethargic. He is at the 75th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight; he has had no change in his weight since his last examination 9 months ago. His temperature is 37.7°C (99.8°F), blood pressure is 110/68 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 28/min. Examination of the skin shows a purple-red discoloration over the cheeks and eyelids, periorbital edema, erythematous plaques and scales over the elbows and knees, and flat-topped red papules over all knuckles. There is generalized weakness and atrophy of the proximal muscles. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Choices: a) Dermatomyositis b) Duchenne's muscular dystrophy c) Eczema d) Lyme disease 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key symptoms of the case. The boy has progressive weakness, a purple-red discoloration over his cheeks and upper eyelids, and generalized weakness and atrophy of the proximal muscles.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these symptoms. The boy's symptoms began shortly after a camping trip, and he has been using a topical corticosteroid for dry, scaly patches of the skin.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Dermatomyositis is a condition characterized by skin rash and muscle weakness, which matches the boy's symptoms. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness, but it typically presents in early childhood and is not associated with a skin rash. Eczema is a skin condition that can cause dry, scaly patches, but it is not typically associated with muscle weakness. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that can cause a skin rash, but it is not typically associated with progressive muscle weakness.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: A sexually active 20-year-old woman has had fever, chills, malaise, and pain of the vulva for 2 days. Examination shows a vulvar pustule that has ulcerated and formed multiple satellite lesions. Nodes are palpated in the inguinal and femoral areas. A smear of fluid from the lesions establishes the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism? Choices: a) Chlamydia trachomatis b) Haemophilus ducreyi c) Neisseria gonorrhoeae d) Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms presented in the scenario. The patient has fever, chills, malaise, and pain of the vulva, along with a vulvar pustule that has ulcerated and formed multiple satellite lesions, and palpated nodes in the inguinal and femoral areas.
Next, I need to consider the characteristics of the symptoms. The presence of a vulvar pustule that has ulcerated and formed multiple satellite lesions is a key feature. This is a classic presentation of a sexually transmitted infection.
Now, I need to consider the possible causal organisms. Chlamydia trachomatis typically causes urethritis or cervicitis, but it does not usually cause a pustule or ulcer. Haemophilus ducreyi is the causative agent of chancroid, which is characterized by a painful genital ulcer with satellite lesions, which matches the patient's symptoms. Neisseria gonorrhoeae causes gonorrhea, which typically presents with urethritis or cervicitis, but not a pustule or ulcer. Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) causes impetigo, which is a skin infection that presents with pustules or vesicles, but it is not typically sexually transmitted.

"Input: A 64-year-old man with non-Hodgkin lymphoma comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of progressive numbness in his hands and feet and weakness in his legs when he stands. He received his third course of chemotherapy 4 weeks ago. Physical examination shows areflexia. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these adverse effects? Choices: a) Doxorubicin b) Fluorouracil c) Methotrexate d) Vincristine 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms described in the scenario. The patient has progressive numbness in his hands and feet, weakness in his legs when he stands, and areflexia.
Next, I need to consider the side effects of the chemotherapy drugs listed. Vincristine is known to cause peripheral neuropathy, which can lead to numbness, weakness, and areflexia.
The other options, Doxorubicin, Fluorouracil, and Methotrexate, are not typically associated with these specific side effects.
Therefore, the most likely cause of these adverse effects is Vincristine, which is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 52-year-old man comes to the physician with his wife because of a 1-year history of excessive daytime sleepiness. He does not think the symptoms are problematic, but his wife is concerned because he sometimes falls asleep on the sofa early in the evening when guests are present. He also once fell asleep while driving at night and drove off the road, narrowly avoiding injury. His wife says that he has always snored loudly, and over the past year, he has had episodes of choking or gasping for breath while sleeping. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 105 kg (231 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2. His pulse is 76/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 150/76 mm Hg. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis? Choices: a) 24-Hour ambulatory ECG monitoring b) Multiple sleep latency test c) Polysomnography d) CT scan of the head 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms presented by the patient. The patient has excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, episodes of choking or gasping for breath while sleeping, and a history of falling asleep while driving.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these symptoms. The symptoms are suggestive of sleep apnea, a condition characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep.
To confirm the diagnosis, I need to choose a diagnostic test that can accurately measure the patient's sleep patterns and breathing during sleep. Among the options, polysomnography (PSG) is the most appropriate test for diagnosing sleep apnea. PSG is a comprehensive sleep study that records various physiological activities during sleep, including brain waves, muscle activity, and breathing patterns.

"Input: A 47-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 2 hours after the sudden onset of shortness of breath, severe chest pain, and sweating. He has no history of similar symptoms. He has hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. His pulse is 110/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 110/50 mm Hg. A grade 3/6, diastolic blowing murmur is heard over the left sternal border and radiates to the right sternal border. Femoral pulses are decreased bilaterally. An ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Choices: a) Acute myocardial infarction b) Aortic dissection c) Esophageal rupture d) Mitral valve prolapse 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key symptoms and signs presented in the case. The patient has sudden onset of shortness of breath, severe chest pain, and sweating, which are classic symptoms of a cardiac emergency. He also has a history of hypertension and smoking, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
Next, I need to analyze the physical examination findings. The patient has a diastolic blowing murmur heard over the left sternal border, which radiates to the right sternal border. This is a classic finding for aortic regurgitation. Additionally, the patient has decreased femoral pulses bilaterally, which suggests aortic insufficiency.
Now, I need to consider the ECG findings. The ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy, which is consistent with chronic hypertension.
Based on the above analysis, the most likely diagnosis is aortic regurgitation, which is a condition where the aortic valve does not close properly, allowing blood to flow back into the left ventricle. This condition is often caused by chronic hypertension and can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and decreased femoral pulses.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for her first influenza virus vaccination. She has a history of untreated hypertension. Her blood pressure is 160/100 mm Hg, and pulse is 100/min. Shortly after administration of the influenza virus vaccine, she develops shortness of breath, hives, and angioedema. Which of the following is most likely to have prevented this reaction? Choices: a) Inquiry about an egg allergy b) Heterophile agglutination test c) Skin test with histamine reagent d) β-Adrenergic blocking agent therapy 
Output:
First, I need to identify the type of reaction the woman is experiencing. The symptoms of shortness of breath, hives, and angioedema are indicative of an anaphylactic reaction.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of anaphylaxis in this patient. The patient has a history of untreated hypertension, which may be relevant, but the most likely cause of anaphylaxis in this case is the influenza virus vaccine.
Now, I need to consider the options for preventing anaphylaxis. Option a) Inquiry about an egg allergy is relevant because some influenza virus vaccines are made from eggs, and an egg allergy can increase the risk of anaphylaxis. However, this patient's symptoms occurred shortly after vaccination, so it is unlikely that an egg allergy was the cause.
Option b) Heterophile agglutination test is not relevant to preventing anaphylaxis.
Option c) Skin test with histamine reagent is not relevant to preventing anaphylaxis.
Option d) β-Adrenergic blocking agent therapy is not relevant to preventing anaphylaxis.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 42-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis comes to the office because she had a sudden loss of vision in the right eye. She has no history of diplopia. External ocular movements are normal but funduscopic examination shows pallor of the optic disk. This patient's condition is most likely a result of demyelination of which of the following? Choices: a) Medial longitudinal fasciculus b) Oculomotor nerve c) Optic nerve d) Trigeminal nerve 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms presented by the patient. The patient has a sudden loss of vision in the right eye, with no history of diplopia, and the funduscopic examination shows pallor of the optic disk.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these symptoms. The patient has a history of multiple sclerosis, which is a demyelinating disease.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. The medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) is a bundle of nerve fibers that connects the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves, and is involved in the coordination of eye movements. Demyelination of the MLF can cause internuclear ophthalmoplegia, which is characterized by impaired adduction of the eye on the same side as the lesion, but not loss of vision. The oculomotor nerve (b) is responsible for controlling the movement of the eye, but demyelination of this nerve would not cause loss of vision without diplopia. The trigeminal nerve (d) is responsible for sensation in the face, but demyelination of this nerve would not cause loss of vision. The optic nerve (c) is responsible for transmitting visual information from the eye to the brain, and demyelination of this nerve would cause loss of vision.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: A previously healthy 17-year-old girl comes to the emergency department because of a 5-day history of progressive lower abdominal pain, fever, and malodorous vaginal discharge. Menarche was at the age of 12 years, and her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with one male partner and uses a combination contraceptive patch. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows severe lower quadrant tenderness bilaterally. Pelvic examination shows a purulent cervical discharge, cervical motion tenderness, and bilateral adnexal tenderness. Her hemoglobin concentration is 10.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 13,000/mm3, and platelet count is 345,000/mm3. A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? Choices: a) Oral azithromycin b) Vaginal clindamycin c) Intravenous penicillin and vancomycin d) Intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's symptoms and the likely diagnosis. The patient has a 5-day history of progressive lower abdominal pain, fever, and malodorous vaginal discharge. She is sexually active and has a purulent cervical discharge, cervical motion tenderness, and bilateral adnexal tenderness on pelvic examination. These symptoms are suggestive of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).
Next, I need to consider the patient's age, sexual history, and the presence of a purulent cervical discharge, which suggests a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The patient is 17 years old and has a history of sexual activity with one male partner. The presence of a purulent cervical discharge and cervical motion tenderness suggests a bacterial STI, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis.
Now, I need to consider the patient's treatment options. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend treating PID with a combination of antibiotics that cover both N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. The CDC recommends intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline as the first-line treatment for PID.
Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 26-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of an 8-hour history of severe back and abdominal pain and mild but persistent vaginal bleeding. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows a 2-cm ectopic pregnancy in the ampulla. The ampulla has ruptured into the surrounding tissue. Fluid from this rupture will most likely be found in which of the following locations? Choices: a) Lesser peritoneal cavity b) Mesometrium c) Pouch of Douglas d) Uterine cavity 
Output:
First, I need to understand the anatomy of the female reproductive system. The ampulla is a part of the fallopian tube, which connects the ovary to the uterus.
Since the ectopic pregnancy has ruptured into the surrounding tissue, the fluid from the rupture will spread to the surrounding area.
The ampulla is located near the uterus, so the fluid will most likely spread to the area near the uterus.
The pouch of Douglas is a space between the uterus and the rectum, and it is a common location for fluid to accumulate in cases of pelvic pathology.
Therefore, the fluid from the rupture will most likely be found in the pouch of Douglas.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

"Input: A 64-year-old male presents to the emergency room with a bloody nose that has been dripping out his nares for the past 2 hours. He denies any trauma, recent upper respiratory illness, or history of prior bloody nose. Past medical history is unremarkable, and he takes no medications. He has a blood pressure of 180/90 mmHg. Examination of the nasal passages reveals that the site of the bleeding is on the septal mucosa of the right naris. The most appropriate next step in management includes Choices: a) anterior packing b) placing an ice compress over the nose c) catheter balloon tamponade d) pinching the nares together for 5 minutes 
Output:
First, I need to assess the patient's condition. The patient is a 64-year-old male with a bloody nose that has been dripping for 2 hours, and he has a history of hypertension (high blood pressure).
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of the bleeding. The patient denies any trauma, recent upper respiratory illness, or history of prior bloody nose, which makes a bleeding disorder or a tumor less likely.
The patient's blood pressure is elevated at 180/90 mmHg, which may be contributing to the bleeding.
Now, I need to consider the management options. The patient's bleeding is not severe, and he is not in shock, so immediate intervention is not necessary.
The most appropriate next step in management is to apply gentle pressure to the nasal passages to stop the bleeding. Pinching the nares together for 5 minutes is a simple and effective way to do this.

"Input: A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of recurrent, widespread blister formation. Physical examination shows lesions that are most numerous in the flexural areas including the axillae and groin. The blisters do not break easily, and there are no oral lesions. These blisters are most likely the result of adhesion failure involving which of the following? Choices: a) Basement membrane b) Dermal papillae c) Langerhans cells d) Melanocytes 
Output:
First, I need to identify the condition described in the scenario. The description of widespread blister formation, particularly in flexural areas, and the absence of oral lesions, suggests a diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris.
Next, I need to understand the pathophysiology of pemphigus vulgaris. Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies against desmoglein 3, a protein that plays a crucial role in the adhesion between keratinocytes.
Now, I need to determine which structure is most likely involved in the adhesion failure. The basement membrane is a structure that separates the epidermis from the dermis, but it is not directly involved in the adhesion between keratinocytes. Dermal papillae are small projections of the dermis that contain capillaries, but they are not directly involved in the adhesion between keratinocytes. Langerhans cells are a type of dendritic cell that plays a role in the immune response, but they are not directly involved in the adhesion between keratinocytes. Melanocytes are cells that produce melanin, but they are not directly involved in the adhesion between keratinocytes.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

"Input: A 65-year-old man who is quadriplegic as a result of multiple sclerosis is hospitalized for treatment of left lower lobe pneumonia. His temperature is 38.1°C (100.5°F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. He appears malnourished. Rhonchi are heard at the left lower lobe of the lung on auscultation. Examination of the heart, lymph nodes, abdomen, and extremities shows no abnormalities. There is a 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration. Neurologic examination shows quadriparesis. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Which of the following is the most effective intervention for this patient's skin lesion? Choices: a) Frequent turning b) Use of wet to dry dressings c) Whirlpool therapy d) Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy 
Output:
First, I need to identify the type of skin lesion. The description of the lesion as a 1-cm area of erythema with intact skin and no induration suggests that it is a pressure ulcer, also known as a bedsore.
Next, I need to consider the patient's risk factors for developing pressure ulcers. The patient is quadriplegic, which means he has limited mobility and is at high risk for developing pressure ulcers. He is also malnourished, which can further increase his risk.
Now, I need to consider the most effective intervention for the patient's skin lesion. The most effective intervention for a pressure ulcer is to prevent further pressure on the affected area. This can be achieved by frequent turning of the patient to redistribute the pressure.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 25-year-old woman who is 19 weeks pregnant comes to the office for a prenatal examination. Her father had classic hemophilia. A karyotype obtained from an amniotic fluid sample of the patient shows that the fetus is XY. Which of the following should you tell the patient regarding her infant? Choices: a) The infant will neither have hemophilia nor be a carrier b) The infant has a 50% risk for hemophilia c) The infant has a 50% risk for being a carrier d) The infant has a 75% risk for hemophilia 
Output:
First, I need to understand the genetic basis of hemophilia. Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder, which means that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome. Since the patient is a woman, she has two X chromosomes (XX), and her father had classic hemophilia, which means he was hemizygous for the mutated gene (Xh).
Next, I need to determine the genotype of the fetus. The karyotype shows that the fetus is XY, which means it has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Since the patient is a carrier of the mutated gene, she has one normal X chromosome (X) and one mutated X chromosome (Xh).
To determine the risk for the fetus, I need to consider the possible genotypes of the fetus. The fetus can inherit either the normal X chromosome (X) or the mutated X chromosome (Xh) from the mother. If the fetus inherits the mutated X chromosome (Xh), it will be hemizygous for the mutated gene and will have hemophilia. If the fetus inherits the normal X chromosome (X), it will not have hemophilia but will be a carrier of the mutated gene.
Since the patient is a carrier of the mutated gene, there is a 50% chance that the fetus will inherit the mutated X chromosome (Xh) and a 50% chance that the fetus will inherit the normal X chromosome (X). Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 20-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting. She says that today she noticed a slight amount of blood in her vomit. She is a pre-med college student and admits to being under a lot of stress as she takes final exams. She also says that she drinks a large amount of coffee daily. Vital signs are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial test to order? Choices: a) abdominal flat plate radiography b) amylase level c) complete blood count d) urine pregnancy test 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and history. The patient is a young female presenting with nausea, vomiting, and hematemesis (blood in the vomit). These symptoms could be related to a variety of causes, including gastrointestinal issues, stress, or even pregnancy.
Next, I need to consider the patient's history of stress and coffee consumption. While stress and caffeine can contribute to gastrointestinal issues, they are less likely to cause hematemesis.
The most concerning possibility is pregnancy, especially given the patient's age and the presence of hematemesis. Pregnancy can cause nausea and vomiting, and the presence of blood in the vomit could indicate a more serious condition such as a threatened abortion or a placental abruption.
Therefore, the most appropriate initial test to order is a urine pregnancy test.

"Input: A 60-year-old man had a total thyroidectomy and excision of enlarged left jugular lymph nodes for follicular carcinoma. The operation was uncomplicated. He is receiving intravenous 5% dextrose and 0.45% saline with potassium. Twelve hours after the operation he develops circumoral numbness and paresthesias in his fingertips, and he becomes very anxious. Vital signs are temperature 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse 90/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses a dry neck dressing and no stridor. Extremities are warm, with brisk capillary refill time. Additional physical examination is most likely to show which of the following? Choices: a) Babinski sign present bilaterally b) Chvostek sign c) Deviation of the tongue to the left side d) A drooping left shoulder 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms presented by the patient. The patient is experiencing circumoral numbness and paresthesias in his fingertips, and he is becoming anxious. These symptoms suggest hypocalcemia, which is a low level of calcium in the blood.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of hypocalcemia in this patient. The patient had a total thyroidectomy, which means that the parathyroid glands were likely removed or damaged during the surgery. The parathyroid glands are responsible for producing parathyroid hormone (PTH), which helps to regulate calcium levels in the blood. If the parathyroid glands are damaged, PTH production may be impaired, leading to hypocalcemia.
Now, I need to consider the physical examination findings that are most likely to be present in a patient with hypocalcemia. The Chvostek sign is a clinical sign that is often used to diagnose hypocalcemia. It is characterized by twitching of the facial muscles in response to tapping the facial nerve. The Chvostek sign is a sensitive indicator of hypocalcemia, and it is often present in patients with low calcium levels.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: In a cohort study of elderly women, the relative risk ratio for hip fractures among those who exercise regularly is 1.2 (95% confidence interval of 1.1 to 1.8). Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion about the effect of regular exercise on the risk for hip fracture? Choices: a) Statistically nonsignificant increase in risk b) Statistically nonsignificant overall decrease in risk c) Statistically significant overall decrease in risk d) Statistically significant overall increase in risk 
Output:
First, I need to understand the given information. The relative risk ratio is 1.2, which means that the risk of hip fractures among those who exercise regularly is 1.2 times the risk among those who do not exercise regularly.
Next, I need to consider the 95% confidence interval, which is 1.1 to 1.8. This interval includes 1, which means that the true relative risk ratio could be 1 (no effect) or greater than 1 (an increase in risk).
Since the interval includes 1, I can conclude that the effect of regular exercise on the risk for hip fracture is statistically nonsignificant.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: A 33-year-old man undergoes a radical thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer. During the operation, moderate hemorrhaging requires ligation of several vessels in the left side of the neck. Postoperatively, serum studies show a calcium concentration of 7.5 mg/dL, albumin concentration of 4 g/dL, and parathyroid hormone concentration of 200 pg/mL. Damage to which of the following vessels caused the findings in this patient? Choices: a) Branch of the costocervical trunk b) Branch of the external carotid artery c) Branch of the thyrocervical trunk d) Tributary of the internal jugular vein 
Output:
First, I need to understand the clinical scenario. The patient underwent a thyroidectomy and experienced moderate hemorrhaging, which required ligation of several vessels in the left side of the neck. Postoperatively, the patient has a low calcium level (7.5 mg/dL), which is a critical finding.
Next, I need to consider the anatomy of the neck and the vessels that supply the thyroid gland. The parathyroid glands are located near the thyroid gland and are also supplied by branches of the same arteries.
The patient's low calcium level and high parathyroid hormone level suggest that the damage was to a vessel that supplies the parathyroid glands, which are responsible for regulating calcium levels in the blood.
The correct answer is the vessel that supplies the parathyroid glands. The thyrocervical trunk is a branch of the subclavian artery that supplies the thyroid gland and the parathyroid glands. Therefore, damage to a branch of the thyrocervical trunk would cause the findings in this patient.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 44-year-old woman with a 10-year history of arthritis comes to the office because she has had increasing pain and stiffness in her hands, wrists, and knees during the past several months. She also has had increasing fatigue for the past month, along with a weight loss of 1.8 to 2.2 kg (4 to 5 lb). She has seen numerous physicians for her arthritis in the past and has tried various medications and devices, including copper bracelets from Mexico given to her by friends. Review of her medical records confirms that the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is correct. She says, ""I had several drop attacks during the past 3 months."" She characterizes these attacks as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes. During one of these episodes, she became incontinent. She currently takes aspirin approximately four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally. Physical examination shows facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, bilaterally. There is moderate ulnar deviation of the fingers. The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her ""drop attacks?"" Choices: a) Adrenal insufficiency b) Anxiety c) Atlanto-axial instability d) Cardiac arrhythmia 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms. She has had increasing pain and stiffness in her hands, wrists, and knees, which is consistent with rheumatoid arthritis. However, she also has had episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs, which she describes as ""drop attacks."" These episodes are characterized by incontinence, which suggests a neurological cause.
Next, I need to consider the patient's medical history. She has a 10-year history of rheumatoid arthritis, which is a chronic autoimmune disorder that can cause inflammation and damage to the joints. However, rheumatoid arthritis is not typically associated with neurological symptoms such as drop attacks.
Now, I need to consider the patient's current symptoms and medical history together. The patient's symptoms of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs, along with incontinence, suggest a neurological cause. The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis, along with the presence of facial plethora and swollen and painful joints, suggests that she may have a complication of her rheumatoid arthritis. One possible complication is atlanto-axial instability, which is a condition in which the joints between the atlas and axis vertebrae become unstable, leading to compression of the spinal cord and neurological symptoms.
Therefore, the most likely cause of her ""drop attacks"" is atlanto-axial instability. {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Three days after hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis, an 87-year-old woman refuses insulin injections. She says that her medical condition has declined so much that she no longer wishes to go on living; she is nearly blind and will likely require bilateral leg amputations. She reports that she has always been an active person and does not see how her life will be of value anymore. She has no family and most of her friends are sick or deceased. On mental status examination, she is alert and cooperative. She accurately describes her medical history and understands the consequences of refusing insulin. There is no evidence of depression. She dismisses any attempts by the physician to change her mind, saying that the physician is too young to understand her situation. She says, ""I know I will die, and this is what I want."" Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Choices: a) Discharge the patient after she has signed an ""against medical advice"" form b) Seek a court order to appoint a legal guardian c) Offer insulin but allow the patient to refuse it d) Admit to the psychiatric unit 
Output:
First, I need to assess the patient's mental status and medical condition. The patient is alert and cooperative, and there is no evidence of depression. She accurately describes her medical history and understands the consequences of refusing insulin.
Next, I need to consider the patient's autonomy and decision-making capacity. The patient is 87 years old and has a terminal illness, which may affect her decision-making capacity. However, she is still able to make decisions and has expressed her desire to refuse insulin.
Now, I need to consider the patient's wishes and the potential consequences of refusing insulin. The patient is aware of the consequences of refusing insulin and has made an informed decision. Refusing insulin will likely lead to her death, but it is her decision to make.
The most appropriate next step in management is to respect the patient's autonomy and allow her to refuse insulin. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: An 8-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother because of a 3-day history of fever, sore throat, and itchy eyes. He just returned from a weeklong summer camp that included hiking trips and swimming lessons in the camp-owned swimming pool. He has no history of major medical illness and receives no medications. He appears tired. His temperature is 39.4°C (102.9°F); other vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows conjunctival injection and discharge and oropharyngeal erythema. The public health department reports an outbreak of similar symptoms among the other campers and camp volunteers. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms? Choices: a) Adenovirus b) Cytomegalovirus c) Epstein-Barr virus d) Influenza virus 
Output:
First, I need to consider the symptoms presented by the patient, which include fever, sore throat, and itchy eyes. These symptoms suggest a viral infection.
Next, I need to consider the context in which the patient contracted the infection, which is a summer camp with hiking trips and swimming lessons. This context suggests that the infection is likely to be highly contagious and spread through close contact or contaminated water.
Now, I need to consider the options provided. Adenovirus is a common cause of viral infections, particularly in children, and is known to cause symptoms such as fever, sore throat, and conjunctivitis (itchy eyes). It is also highly contagious and can be spread through close contact or contaminated water. Cytomegalovirus is a less likely cause, as it typically causes more severe symptoms in immunocompromised individuals. Epstein-Barr virus is also a less likely cause, as it typically causes infectious mononucleosis, which presents with different symptoms. Influenza virus is also a less likely cause, as it typically causes respiratory symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath.
Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms is adenovirus. {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 37-year-old man comes to the emergency department because he has felt nauseated and light-headed for the past hour. Medical history is significant for esophageal varices secondary to alcohol-related cirrhosis and ascites treated with spironolactone. He drinks eight to ten alcoholic beverages daily. While you are obtaining additional history, the patient vomits a large volume of bright red blood and becomes difficult to arouse. Vital signs are temperature 36.0°C (96.8°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 12/min, and blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Following initiation of intravenous fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management? Choices: a) Arrange for transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunting b) Begin intravenous vasopressin therapy c) Do endotracheal intubation d) Do upper endoscopy 
Output:
First, I need to assess the patient's condition. The patient has a history of esophageal varices and ascites, and he is experiencing hematemesis (vomiting blood) and is becoming difficult to arouse, which indicates a possible shock state.
Next, I need to prioritize the patient's immediate needs. The patient's blood pressure is low (90/50 mm Hg), which indicates hypotension, and he is experiencing tachycardia (elevated heart rate) and possibly shock. Therefore, the most appropriate immediate management is to stabilize the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs).
To do this, I need to perform endotracheal intubation to secure the patient's airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. This is the most appropriate immediate management because it addresses the patient's life-threatening condition and allows for further management of his shock and bleeding.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 17-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being found with a ""blank stare"" and flat facial expression at a party. His pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 104/68 mm Hg. He is sitting upright and appears catatonic. Physical examination shows rigidity. During the examination, he becomes hostile and attempts to assault the physician. This patient most likely ingested which of the following drugs? Choices: a) Diazepam b) Methamphetamine c) Oxycodone d) PCP (phencyclidine) 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key symptoms presented in the case. The patient has a ""blank stare"" and flat facial expression, which suggests a lack of responsiveness or consciousness. He is also catatonic, which means he is immobile and unresponsive. Additionally, he exhibits rigidity, which is a sign of muscle stiffness.
Next, I need to consider the potential effects of each listed drug. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that can cause sedation and relaxation, which is the opposite of the symptoms described. Methamphetamine is a stimulant that can cause agitation and aggression, but it is less likely to cause catatonia and rigidity. Oxycodone is an opioid that can cause sedation and respiratory depression, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.
PCP (phencyclidine) is a dissociative anesthetic that can cause a range of symptoms, including catatonia, rigidity, and a ""blank stare."" It can also cause aggression and hostility, which is consistent with the patient's behavior during the examination.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 24-year-old recent college graduate comes to the office because of a 3-year history of increased frequency of urination and occasional incontinence whenever she travels. She says the urinary symptoms typically begin a few days before she is going to fly and they stop the day after she arrives at her destination. She says she is anxious about flying and even slightly ""panicky."" She reports having had similar but milder symptoms prior to examinations before graduating. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Urinalysis and urine culture are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step? Choices: a) Recommend behavioral therapy b) Recommend psychoanalytic psychotherapy c) Recommend that the patient avoid any stressful activities that cause the problem d) Review the patient's sexual history 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient has a 3-year history of increased frequency of urination and occasional incontinence, which is exacerbated by travel and anxiety about flying.
Next, I need to consider the patient's physical examination and laboratory results. The physical examination is normal, and the urinalysis and urine culture are normal, which suggests that the patient's symptoms are not due to a urinary tract infection or other underlying medical condition.
Now, I need to consider the patient's psychological symptoms. The patient reports feeling anxious and ""panicky"" about flying, and the symptoms typically begin a few days before she is going to fly and stop the day after she arrives at her destination. This suggests that the patient's symptoms may be related to her anxiety about flying.
Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to recommend behavioral therapy to help the patient manage her anxiety about flying. {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A healthy 2-year-old girl is brought to the office for a routine well-child visit. The child was weaned at 6 months of age and began to walk at 10 months of age. On physical examination, she has mild bowlegs (10-degree genu varum). Which of the following is the most appropriate management to recommend at this time? Choices: a) Increased intake of vitamin D b) A special exercise program c) Surgical correction d) No treatment is needed at this time 
Output:
First, I need to determine the severity of the bowlegs. A 10-degree genu varum is considered mild.
Next, I need to consider the child's age and development. The child is 2 years old and has already begun to walk, which suggests that the bowlegs are not severe enough to cause significant mobility issues.
Now, I need to consider the potential causes of the bowlegs. Mild bowlegs in a 2-year-old child are often due to normal variation in bone growth and development, rather than a specific underlying condition.
Therefore, the most appropriate management is to recommend no treatment at this time, as the bowlegs are likely to self-correct as the child grows and develops. {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 54-year-old man comes to the physician because of episodes of fainting for 3 months. He also has had difficulty performing daily tasks because he is easily fatigued. He had a myocardial infarction 12 years ago. His pulse is 40/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 138/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows evidence of cannon a waves. An ECG shows a P-wave rate of 90/min, and an R-wave rate of 40/min, with no apparent relation between the two. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Choices: a) Right bundle branch block b) Second-degree atrioventricular block, type I c) Second-degree atrioventricular block, type II d) Third-degree atrioventricular block 
Output:
First, I need to understand the symptoms and the physical examination findings. The patient has episodes of fainting, difficulty performing daily tasks due to fatigue, and a history of myocardial infarction. The physical examination shows evidence of cannon a waves, which is a sign of atrioventricular (AV) block.
Next, I need to analyze the ECG findings. The P-wave rate is 90/min, which is the rate of the atria, and the R-wave rate is 40/min, which is the rate of the ventricles. The fact that the P-wave and R-wave rates are not related to each other suggests that there is a block in the conduction of impulses from the atria to the ventricles.
Now, I need to determine the type of AV block. The patient has a P-wave rate that is higher than the R-wave rate, which suggests that there is a block in the conduction of impulses from the atria to the ventricles. The fact that the P-wave and R-wave rates are not related to each other suggests that it is not a first-degree AV block. The patient does not have a P-wave rate that is lower than the R-wave rate, which suggests that it is not a second-degree AV block, type I. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is third-degree AV block, where there is a complete block in the conduction of impulses from the atria to the ventricles, and the atria and ventricles beat independently.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 22-year-old woman contacts a medical student and asks if he would like to join her for dinner. The student met the woman when he was assigned to her care during her 2-week hospitalization for treatment of major depressive disorder. He has not treated or seen the patient since she was discharged from the hospital. He is attracted to this former patient and would be interested in dating her. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the medical student regarding this patient's invitation? Choices: a) He can date her because he was a medical student, not a physician, when he contributed to her care b) He can date her because she is no longer his patient c) He can date her, but only after at least 1 year has passed since he treated her d) He cannot date her because she was once his psychiatric patient 
Output:
First, I need to consider the power dynamic in the situation. The medical student was in a position of authority and care over the woman during her hospitalization, which could create an imbalance in their relationship.
Next, I need to consider the potential impact on the woman's care. If the medical student were to date her, it could compromise his objectivity and ability to provide her with the best care if she were to become his patient again in the future.
Now, I need to consider the ethical guidelines for medical professionals. The American Medical Association (AMA) Code of Medical Ethics states that physicians should avoid exploiting their patients for personal or financial gain, and that they should not engage in sexual or romantic relationships with patients.
Therefore, the most appropriate action by the medical student is to decline the invitation and not date the woman, as stated in choice d) {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 45-year-old woman has a 2-week history of increased anxiety, abdominal discomfort, irritability, and difficulty concentrating; she was robbed at knifepoint in a parking lot 3 weeks ago. She takes levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and uses an over-the-counter inhaler as needed for exercise-induced asthma. Her blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 100/min. Examination shows dry skin and hair. She is cooperative but appears anxious, glancing around quickly when a loud noise is heard outside the office. Leukocyte count is 12,000/mm3, and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is 5.0 μU/mL. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Choices: a) Acute stress disorder b) Agoraphobia c) Generalized anxiety disorder d) Hypothyroidism 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key symptoms and risk factors. The patient has a history of increased anxiety, abdominal discomfort, irritability, and difficulty concentrating, which have been ongoing for 2 weeks. She also has a history of being robbed at knifepoint, which is a significant stressor. Additionally, she has hypothyroidism, which can contribute to anxiety symptoms.
Next, I need to consider the physical examination findings. The patient has dry skin and hair, which are consistent with hypothyroidism. Her blood pressure is elevated, and her pulse is rapid, which can be seen in anxiety disorders. Her leukocyte count is slightly elevated, which can be seen in response to stress.
Now, I need to consider the psychological symptoms. The patient appears anxious and is easily startled by loud noises. She also has difficulty concentrating, which is a common symptom of anxiety disorders.
Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is generalized anxiety disorder. This is because the patient has a history of ongoing anxiety symptoms, difficulty concentrating, and physical symptoms such as an elevated pulse and blood pressure. While the patient has a history of being robbed at knifepoint, which could contribute to acute stress disorder, the symptoms have been ongoing for 2 weeks, which is more consistent with generalized anxiety disorder. Agoraphobia is not supported by the information provided, as there is no mention of fear of leaving home or crowded places. Hypothyroidism is a contributing factor, but it is not the primary diagnosis.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: A 29-year-old Hispanic woman, gravida 3, para 3, comes to the office because of recurrent low back pain during the past year. Rest and analgesics usually eradicate the pain within 2 weeks. However, the pain seems to recur every 2 to 3 months. Medical history is remarkable for gestational diabetes mellitus during her pregnancies. She takes no medications except for an oral contraceptive. She walks 3 miles daily for exercise and works as a sales representative for a computer software company. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb); BMI is 37 kg/m2. Vital signs are normal, and physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step? Choices: a) Administer an epidural injection of methylprednisolone b) Order MRI of the lumbosacral spine c) Order x-rays of the lumbosacral spine d) Recommend beginning a weight loss program 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient has recurrent low back pain that recurs every 2 to 3 months, and she has a history of gestational diabetes mellitus. This suggests that the patient may have a condition related to her weight, such as lumbar disc degeneration or spinal stenosis.
Next, I need to consider the patient's physical examination and vital signs. The patient's physical examination is normal, and her vital signs are normal. This suggests that the patient does not have any acute or severe conditions that require immediate attention.
Now, I need to consider the patient's BMI. The patient's BMI is 37 kg/m2, which is classified as obese. Obesity is a risk factor for many conditions, including lumbar disc degeneration and spinal stenosis.
Based on these considerations, the most appropriate next step is to recommend beginning a weight loss program. This is because weight loss can help to alleviate the patient's symptoms and reduce her risk of developing further complications.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 15-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because of abdominal pain and constipation for the past several weeks. Her mother says, ""She is getting almost all A's in school and she is on the track team."" You ask the patient about her diet and she responds, ""I'm kind of a picky eater."" She requests a laxative to help with her constipation. She is 158 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 43 kg (95 lb); BMI is 18 kg/m2. Pulse is 65/min. Specific additional history should be obtained regarding which of the following? Choices: a) Color, caliber, and frequency of bowel movements b) Exposure to sexually transmitted diseases c) Family history of irritable bowel syndrome d) Menstrual history 
Output:
First, the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and constipation, along with her picky eating habits, raise a red flag for an eating disorder. The patient's low BMI and normal pulse also support this suspicion.
Next, the patient's request for a laxative to help with her constipation is concerning, as individuals with eating disorders often use laxatives as a means of purging.
Now, to further assess the patient's risk for an eating disorder, I would like to obtain more information about her menstrual history. A history of amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) is a common symptom of anorexia nervosa, a type of eating disorder.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 37-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital because of inadequate control of his glucose concentrations for the past 2 months. Despite his poor control, he demands that he be discharged. He reports that he has had a 3-month history of fatigue, irritability, and feelings of hopelessness. He says that he has been noncompliant with his diabetic regimen, adding, ""Sometimes I forget."" He has been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them but admits that he is lonely. He did not get out of bed for 2 days, which prompted his wife to call an ambulance and have him admitted to the hospital. Prior to admission to the hospital, his only medication was insulin, although he often missed doses. He does not drink alcohol. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb); BMI is 36 kg/m2. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 150/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, he is tired and has a restricted affect. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. Cognition is intact. His fasting serum glucose concentration is 120 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Choices: a) Adhere to the patient's wishes and discuss home-care options b) Adhere to the patient's wishes on the condition that he agree to home nursing care c) Schedule neuropsychological testing d) Seek a court order to appoint a legal guardian 
Output:
First, I need to assess the patient's mental status and behavior. The patient reports feelings of hopelessness, irritability, and fatigue, which are common symptoms of depression. He also admits to being lonely and avoiding social interactions, which is consistent with depression. However, he does not report any suicidal ideation, which is a good sign.
Next, I need to consider the patient's medical condition. He has type 1 diabetes mellitus, which requires careful management to prevent complications. His fasting serum glucose concentration is 120 mg/dL, which is within the normal range, but he has been noncompliant with his diabetic regimen, which is a concern.
Now, I need to consider the patient's ability to make decisions about his care. He is 37 years old and has a history of depression, which may affect his judgment. However, he is not currently suicidal, and his cognitive function is intact. Therefore, I need to respect his autonomy and involve him in the decision-making process.
The most appropriate next step in management is to discuss home-care options with the patient and his family. This will allow the patient to take an active role in his care and ensure that he receives the support he needs to manage his diabetes and depression. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 7-month-old infant, who was recently discharged from the hospital following an episode of enteritis and dehydration, has persistent watery diarrhea. His mother feeds him cow-milk formula and a variety of strained fruits and vegetables. On physical examination, his temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), his mucous membranes are dry, and his abdomen is slightly distended. No other abnormalities are seen. The problem is most likely related to which of the following? Choices: a) Fructose intolerance b) Transient lactase deficiency c) Magnesium deficiency d) Regional enteritis 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key information in the problem. The infant has persistent watery diarrhea, was recently discharged from the hospital following an episode of enteritis and dehydration, and is being fed cow-milk formula and strained fruits and vegetables.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of persistent watery diarrhea in an infant. One possible cause is transient lactase deficiency, which is a condition where the infant's body is unable to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk.
Now, I need to evaluate the other options. Fructose intolerance is a condition where the body is unable to digest fructose, but it is not typically associated with persistent watery diarrhea. Magnesium deficiency can cause diarrhea, but it is not the most likely cause in this case. Regional enteritis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease, but it is not typically seen in infants.
Therefore, the most likely cause of the infant's persistent watery diarrhea is transient lactase deficiency. The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 25-year-old gravida 3 para 2 female is admitted to the hospital at 39 weeks' gestation in active labor. She had been having regular contractions every 4 minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6 hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated. The most appropriate management is to Choices: a) administer an epidural anesthetic b) administer tocolytic therapy c) apply cervical topical corticosteroids d) augment the labor with oxytocin 
Output:
First, I need to assess the situation. The patient is in active labor, but the contractions have become weaker and less frequent. This could be a sign of a potential issue with the labor process.
Next, I need to consider the patient's medical history and current condition. The patient is a 25-year-old female in her third pregnancy, and she has been receiving pain medication twice in the past 6 hours. This suggests that she may be experiencing a prolonged labor or a potential issue with the labor process.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) administering an epidural anesthetic may not be the best choice, as it may not address the underlying issue with the labor process. Option b) administering tocolytic therapy is not appropriate, as it is used to slow down labor, not speed it up. Option c) applying cervical topical corticosteroids is not relevant to this situation. Option d) augmenting the labor with oxytocin may be the most appropriate choice, as it can help to stimulate contractions and move the labor process forward.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 15-year-old girl comes to the emergency department because, she says, ""something has been sticking out of my bottom since I had a bowel movement this morning."" She has not had previous episodes, although for more than 1 year she has had occasional difficulty passing stools. She is not in pain but is afraid to move her bowels for fear that the problem will worsen. She tells you that she moved away from home more than a year ago and that her parents contribute nothing to her support. She has a 6-month-old child and lives with a 28-year-old female cousin. She has never been married and does not work or attend school. She has no other symptoms. In order to follow the correct procedure for treating a minor, which of the following is the most appropriate step prior to evaluating this patient's rectal problem? Choices: a) Accept the girl's consent as sufficient b) Obtain a court order permitting evaluation c) Obtain the written consent of at least two licensed physicians d) Obtain written consent from at least one of her parents 
Output:
First, I need to determine the patient's age and the nature of the problem. The patient is a 15-year-old girl, and she is presenting with a rectal problem.
Next, I need to consider the legal requirements for treating minors. In general, minors are considered incapable of giving informed consent for medical treatment.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) is incorrect because the girl's consent is not sufficient. Option c) is incorrect because it is not necessary to obtain the written consent of two licensed physicians. Option d) is incorrect because the girl is not married and does not live with her parents.
The most appropriate step is to obtain a court order permitting evaluation, as this is the most appropriate way to ensure that the girl's rights are protected and that she receives the necessary medical treatment.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: A 37-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 45 minutes after she was found unconscious on her apartment floor. Her coworkers became concerned when she did not arrive for work. On arrival, she is unable to provide a history. Her pulse is 96/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 124/58 mm Hg. Examination shows erythema, warmth, and induration of the upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs. Her serum creatine kinase activity is 10,300 U/L. Urine toxicology screening is positive for opiates and cocaine. Urine dipstick is strongly positive for blood. Microscopic examination of the urine shows pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions over the next 24 hours? Choices: a) Acute respiratory distress syndrome b) Acute tubular necrosis c) Cerebral edema d) Cerebral hemorrhage 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's condition. The patient's symptoms, such as erythema, warmth, and induration of the upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs, suggest a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, which is a condition where muscle tissue breaks down rapidly.
Next, I need to consider the potential complications of rhabdomyolysis. One of the major complications of rhabdomyolysis is acute kidney injury (AKI), which can lead to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
The patient's urine dipstick is strongly positive for blood, and microscopic examination of the urine shows pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes, which are indicative of ATN.
Therefore, the patient is at increased risk for acute tubular necrosis over the next 24 hours.

"Input: A 34-year-old white woman comes to the emergency department because of a persistent dull headache for the past 3 days. She has been taking acetaminophen without relief. She says, ""I haven't slept in 3 days and I am having trouble focusing at work."" There is no history of trauma and she takes no medications. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 14 years but does not drink alcoholic beverages. Vital signs are temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse 86/min, respirations 19/min, and blood pressure 182/100 mm Hg. Examination of the head shows no abnormalities. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light; there is mild photophobia. Funduscopic examination is normal. A serous effusion is noted on examination of the left tympanic membrane. Neck is stiff with painful flexion; when the patient's neck is flexed forward, she reports and electric shock sensation. Mild expiratory wheezes are heard on auscultation of the chest. A midsystolic click is heard best at the left sternal border; there are no murmurs or gallops. Abdominal examination shows striae, but is otherwise noncontributory. Examination of the lower extremities shows varicosities bilaterally and 1+ edema; muscle strength is 4/5. Neurologic examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following physical findings is most indicative of the need for immediate further evaluation? Choices: a) Abdominal striae b) Expiratory wheezes c) Midsystolic click d) Neck stiffness 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key symptoms and signs presented in the case. The patient has a persistent dull headache, photophobia, neck stiffness, and an electric shock sensation when the neck is flexed forward. These symptoms suggest meningitis, which is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known as the meninges.
Next, I need to consider the potential causes of meningitis. The patient's symptoms and signs are most consistent with viral meningitis, which is often caused by enteroviruses. However, bacterial meningitis is a more serious and potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate evaluation and treatment.
Now, I need to identify the physical finding that is most indicative of the need for immediate further evaluation. The presence of neck stiffness is a classic sign of meningitis, and it is the most concerning finding in this case. The patient's neck stiffness is accompanied by other symptoms such as photophobia and an electric shock sensation when the neck is flexed forward, which further supports the diagnosis of meningitis.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 14-year-old girl is brought to the physician after her mother learned that she began having sexual intercourse with various partners 1 month ago. She does not use condoms or other contraception. The mother is concerned about her behavior. The patient's parents separated 3 months ago. She had been an honor student and excelled in sports and leadership positions at school before the separation. Since the separation, however, she has become sullen, defiant, and rebellious. She has begun smoking cigarettes, disobeying her curfew, and being truant from school. This patient is most likely using which of the following defense mechanisms? Choices: a) Acting out b) Displacement c) Projection d) Reaction formation 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's behavior before and after the separation. Before the separation, she was an honor student and excelled in sports and leadership positions, indicating that she was well-adjusted and responsible.
After the separation, she began to exhibit rebellious behavior, such as smoking cigarettes, disobeying her curfew, and being truant from school. This change in behavior suggests that she is acting out her feelings in a way that is opposite to her previous behavior.
The defense mechanism of acting out involves expressing unconscious feelings or impulses through behavior, often in a way that is unacceptable or inappropriate. In this case, the patient is acting out her feelings of anger, sadness, or frustration related to the separation by engaging in rebellious behavior.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A previously healthy 27-year-old man comes to the physician 4 weeks after noticing three nontender lesions on his penis. He says they have not changed in size. He is sexually active with multiple male and female partners and uses condoms inconsistently. He takes no medications. He drinks two to five beers on social occasions. He occasionally smokes marijuana. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F). There is no lymphadenopathy. Examination shows three sessile, flesh-colored lesions on the shaft of the penis that are 10 mm in diameter. On application of a dilute solution of acetic acid, the lesions turn white. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Choices: a) Oral acyclovir therapy b) Oral doxycycline therapy c) Intramuscular penicillin therapy d) Cryotherapy 
Output:
First, I need to identify the condition based on the symptoms described. The patient has three nontender lesions on his penis that have not changed in size, and they turn white when a dilute solution of acetic acid is applied. This is suggestive of genital warts, which are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV).
Next, I need to consider the patient's sexual history and the fact that he is sexually active with multiple partners. This increases the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HPV.
Now, I need to determine the most appropriate next step in management. The patient does not have symptoms of an STI that requires immediate treatment, such as syphilis or gonorrhea. The lesions are not painful and have not changed in size, so they are not likely to be a sign of an STI that requires urgent treatment.
Cryotherapy is a common treatment for genital warts, and it is the most appropriate next step in management. It involves freezing the lesions with liquid nitrogen, which causes them to fall off. Oral acyclovir is used to treat herpes simplex virus infections, not HPV. Oral doxycycline is used to treat bacterial infections, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, but it is not indicated for HPV. Intramuscular penicillin is used to treat syphilis, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 59-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 4-day history of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He also has been confused and agitated during this period. He has a history of mild hypertension. His current medication is a diuretic. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 108/min, respirations are 26/min, and blood pressure is 70/47 mm Hg. Physical examination shows delayed capillary refill of the lips and nail beds and cool extremities. His oxyhemoglobin saturation in a central vein is 60% (N=70–75). These findings are most consistent with which of the following types of shock? Choices: a) Cardiogenic b) Distributive c) Hypovolemic d) Obstructive 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key findings in this case. The patient has a history of mild hypertension and is currently taking a diuretic, which may be contributing to his symptoms. He has a low blood pressure (70/47 mm Hg), tachycardia (108/min), and tachypnea (26/min). He also has delayed capillary refill and cool extremities, which suggest poor perfusion of the peripheral circulation. His oxyhemoglobin saturation is low (60%), which indicates inadequate oxygen delivery to the tissues.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these findings. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are most consistent with distributive shock. Distributive shock is characterized by a maldistribution of blood flow, leading to inadequate perfusion of vital organs. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including sepsis, anaphylaxis, and vasodilatory medications.
The patient's history of mild hypertension and use of a diuretic may be contributing to his symptoms, but they are not the primary cause. The patient's low blood pressure and poor perfusion of the peripheral circulation are more consistent with distributive shock than with cardiogenic, hypovolemic, or obstructive shock.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 13-month-old child is brought to the emergency department because of urticaria, swelling of the lips, and difficulty breathing immediately after eating an egg. A potential risk for hypersensitivity reaction is posed by vaccination against which of the following illnesses? Choices: a) Hepatitis b) Influenza c) Pertussis d) Poliomyelitis 
Output:
First, I need to identify the allergen that caused the reaction. The child had a reaction after eating an egg, which is a common allergen.
Next, I need to consider the potential risks of hypersensitivity reactions associated with vaccinations. Some vaccines contain egg proteins, which can cause allergic reactions in individuals with egg allergies.
Now, I need to determine which vaccine is most likely to contain egg proteins. The influenza vaccine is commonly produced using chicken eggs, which means it contains egg proteins.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 27-year-old man is admitted to the hospital 45 minutes after being involved in a motor vehicle collision. Physical examination shows a sluggish response to stimuli. Neurologic examination shows no other abnormalities. A skull x-ray shows a linear, nondepressed basal skull fracture. Two weeks later, the patient develops polyuria and polydipsia. Laboratory studies show a serum glucose concentration within the reference range, increased serum osmolality, and decreased urine osmolality. Following the administration of desmopressin, urine osmolality increases. The beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to activation of which of the following? Choices: a) Adenylyl cyclase b) Ca2+ channels c) Janus kinase d) Serine kinase 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's condition. The patient has a basal skull fracture and is experiencing polyuria and polydipsia, which suggests a problem with the regulation of water in the body.
Next, I need to consider the laboratory studies. The patient has increased serum osmolality and decreased urine osmolality, which suggests that the patient is unable to concentrate urine.
The patient's response to desmopressin suggests that the patient has a problem with the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) pathway.
Desmopressin is a synthetic analogue of ADH, and its beneficial effect is most likely due to its activation of the ADH receptor.
The ADH receptor is coupled to adenylyl cyclase, which increases the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and leads to the reabsorption of water in the kidneys.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 35-year-old female develops nausea and vomiting after she underwent a cholecystectomy for protracted ileus. Her body mass index was 23 kg/m2 before surgery, and, except for the cholecystitis, she was in good health. The patient remains unable to eat 6 days after surgery. Which of the following forms of nutritional support is most appropriate for this patient? Choices: a) central hyperalimentation b) feeding through a nasogastric feeding tube c) oral fat-free modular diet d) peripheral hyperalimentation 
Output:
First, I need to assess the patient's condition. The patient is a 35-year-old female who underwent a cholecystectomy and is now experiencing nausea and vomiting, which is preventing her from eating.
Next, I need to consider the patient's nutritional needs. The patient has been unable to eat for 6 days, which means she is at risk of malnutrition. She needs a form of nutritional support that can provide her with the necessary nutrients to support her recovery.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) central hyperalimentation is a form of intravenous nutrition that is typically used for patients who have a high risk of aspiration or have a bowel obstruction. This patient does not have these conditions, so this option is not the most appropriate.
Option b) feeding through a nasogastric feeding tube is a form of enteral nutrition that can provide the patient with the necessary nutrients. However, this patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, which may make it difficult to tolerate enteral nutrition.
Option c) oral fat-free modular diet is a form of enteral nutrition that is designed to provide patients with the necessary nutrients while minimizing the risk of complications. This option is appropriate for patients who are at risk of malnutrition and are unable to eat.
Option d) peripheral hyperalimentation is a form of intravenous nutrition that is typically used for patients who have a high risk of infection or have a compromised immune system. This patient does not have these conditions, so this option is not the most appropriate.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 27-year-old nurse comes to the emergency department because of nervousness, dizziness, palpitations, and excess perspiration for the past 3 hours. She has had similar episodes over the past 6 months. The symptoms improve following ingestion of orange juice or soft drinks. She says that she has had a great deal of stress. She has been drinking two alcoholic beverages daily for the past month; before this time, she seldom drank alcohol. Examination shows no abnormalities. Her serum glucose concentration is 30 mg/dL. Intravenous glucose is administered, and the patient's symptoms improve. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis? Choices: a) Measurement of serum proinsulin and insulin antibodies b) Measurement of serum cortisol and ACTH concentrations c) Measurement of serum growth hormone and plasma somatomedin-C concentrations d) Measurement of serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms and the patient's history. The patient is experiencing episodes of nervousness, dizziness, palpitations, and excess perspiration, which improve after ingesting orange juice or soft drinks. She has a history of stress and has recently increased her alcohol consumption.
Next, I need to consider the patient's serum glucose concentration, which is 30 mg/dL. This is a low value, indicating hypoglycemia.
The patient's symptoms and low serum glucose concentration suggest that she may have a disorder of glucose regulation, such as insulinoma or factitious hypoglycemia.
To further investigate this possibility, I need to measure the patient's insulin and C-peptide concentrations. This will help determine if the patient is producing excess insulin, which could be causing her symptoms.
Therefore, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 54-year-old woman comes to the office because she has had intermittent shooting pain over her right cheek and jaw during the past 3 weeks. Each episode of pain lasts for 1 second or less. The pain is often triggered by cold air, chewing, tactile stimulation, and brushing her teeth. She has had no trauma to the face or head. Medical history is remarkable for tension headaches, obesity, and gastric bypass surgery. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 62 kg (137 lb); BMI is 23 kg/m2. Vital signs are normal. The patient cannot tolerate touch over the right side of the face. There is no facial weakness or loss of sensation. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. CT scan of the head with and without contrast shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time? Choices: a) Carbamazepine b) Lamotrigine c) Levetiracetam d) Topiramate 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's symptoms. The patient has intermittent shooting pain over her right cheek and jaw that lasts for 1 second or less. The pain is triggered by various stimuli, including cold air, chewing, tactile stimulation, and brushing her teeth.
Next, I need to consider the patient's medical history. The patient has a history of tension headaches, obesity, and gastric bypass surgery. However, these conditions do not seem to be directly related to her current symptoms.
Now, I need to consider the patient's physical examination and diagnostic test results. The patient cannot tolerate touch over the right side of her face, but there is no facial weakness or loss of sensation. The CT scan of the head with and without contrast shows no abnormalities.
Based on the patient's symptoms and diagnostic test results, the most likely diagnosis is trigeminal neuralgia. Trigeminal neuralgia is a chronic pain condition that affects the trigeminal nerve, which carries sensation from the face to the brain. The condition is characterized by episodes of intense, stabbing pain in the face that can be triggered by various stimuli.
The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for trigeminal neuralgia is carbamazepine. Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant medication that is commonly used to treat trigeminal neuralgia. It works by reducing the abnormal electrical activity in the brain that causes the pain.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 12-year-old boy with sickle cell disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus is brought to the office by his mother for an initial visit. The family recently moved to the area. Type 1 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in the patient 6 years ago. Since that time, he has been treated with insulin and dietary management. His insulin regimen has not changed during the past year; however, his mother says he has been only marginally compliant with his insulin and dietary regimens. His diabetic diary shows home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations ranging from 140–200 mg/dL during the past 3 months. He admits to checking his glucose concentrations infrequently. Measurement of hemoglobin A1c obtained last week was 5.4%. The patient's vital signs are temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse 72/min, respirations 24/min, and blood pressure 110/64 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the discrepancy between the patient's home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations and his hemoglobin A1c? Choices: a) His daily glucose control is better than recorded b) His glucometer is reading falsely high and should be replaced c) His hemoglobin A1c is likely a result of laboratory error and should be repeated d) His sickle cell disease is affecting his hemoglobin A1c 
Output:
First, I need to understand the patient's situation. The patient has type 1 diabetes mellitus and has been treated with insulin and dietary management for 6 years. However, he has been only marginally compliant with his insulin and dietary regimens, and his home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations have been ranging from 140–200 mg/dL during the past 3 months.
Next, I need to consider the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) result. The HbA1c is 5.4%, which is within the normal range. However, this result seems to be inconsistent with the patient's home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations.
Now, I need to think about the possible explanations for this discrepancy. Option a) is unlikely because the patient's home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations are not low, but rather within a relatively narrow range. Option b) is also unlikely because there is no indication that the glucometer is reading falsely high. Option c) is unlikely because there is no indication of laboratory error. Option d) is the most likely explanation because the patient has sickle cell disease, which can affect hemoglobin A1c levels.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 68-year-old female has a history of breast cancer that has recurred twice in the past 5 years. She has undergone both radiation and chemotherapy for metastatic carcinoma to the bone. She presents to the office today to ask for help in dealing with midthoracic back pain to enable her to use less analgesic agents. The most appropriate osteopathic manipulative technique to treat this patient's spine is Choices: a) high velocity, low amplitude b) indirect myofascial release c) isotonic exercise therapy d) mid velocity, mid amplitude 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's medical history. The patient has a history of breast cancer that has recurred twice in the past 5 years, and she has undergone both radiation and chemotherapy for metastatic carcinoma to the bone. This suggests that she may have compromised bone health and may be at risk for osteoporosis.
Next, I need to consider the patient's symptoms. The patient presents with midthoracic back pain, which is likely related to her compromised bone health.
Given the patient's medical history and symptoms, I would recommend using a gentle and non-invasive technique to treat her spine. Indirect myofascial release is a technique that involves applying gentle, sustained pressure to the soft tissues of the body to help relax and lengthen them. This technique is often used to treat patients with musculoskeletal pain and is a good choice for this patient because it is gentle and non-invasive.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 55-year-old woman with small cell carcinoma of the lung is admitted to the hospital to undergo chemotherapy. Six days after treatment is started, she develops a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F). Physical examination shows no other abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 100/mm3 (5% segmented neutrophils and 95% lymphocytes). Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to increase this patient's leukocyte count? Choices: a) Darbepoetin b) Dexamethasone c) Filgrastim d) Interferon alfa 
Output:
First, I need to identify the type of leukemia the patient has. The patient has small cell carcinoma of the lung, which is a type of cancer, but the patient is admitted to undergo chemotherapy, which suggests that the patient has a type of leukemia.
Next, I need to determine the type of leukemia based on the laboratory studies. The patient has a leukocyte count of 100/mm3, which is low, and 95% lymphocytes, which is a characteristic of lymphocytic leukemia.
Now, I need to determine the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to increase the patient's leukocyte count. The patient has lymphocytic leukemia, which is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow and the blood. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy to increase the patient's leukocyte count is Filgrastim, which is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) that stimulates the production of white blood cells.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 14-year-old girl has had nausea, intermittent diarrhea, and a 2.2-kg (5-lb) weight loss over the past 4 weeks. Examination shows a migrating serpiginous pruritic perianal rash. Her leukocyte count is 8000/mm3 with 20% eosinophils. Which of the following tests is most likely to yield an accurate diagnosis? Choices: a) Blood smear b) Bone marrow biopsy c) KOH preparation d) Microscopic examination of the stool 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms presented by the girl. She has nausea, intermittent diarrhea, and a 2.2-kg weight loss over the past 4 weeks. She also has a migrating serpiginous pruritic perianal rash.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these symptoms. The presence of a pruritic perianal rash and eosinophilia (20% eosinophils) suggests a parasitic infection.
Now, I need to determine which test is most likely to yield an accurate diagnosis. A KOH (potassium hydroxide) preparation is used to diagnose fungal infections, which is not likely in this case. A blood smear may show eosinophilia, but it will not provide a specific diagnosis. A bone marrow biopsy is an invasive procedure that is not typically used to diagnose parasitic infections. A microscopic examination of the stool is the most likely to yield an accurate diagnosis, as it can detect parasites such as pinworms, which cause similar symptoms.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

"Input: A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a physical examination prior to participating in sports. He appears reluctant to remove his shirt for the examination, and says that he is embarrassed because he has grown breasts during the past year. He is at the 50th percentile for height and weight. Physical examination shows bilateral 1.5-cm fibroglandular masses located beneath the nipple-areolar complex and normal penis and testes. Pubic hair development is Tanner stage 3. Serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's breast enlargement? Choices: a) Estradiol-secreting Leydig cell tumor b) Peutz-Jeghers syndrome c) Seminiferous tubule dysgenesis (Klinefelter syndrome) d) Normal development 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's age and physical examination findings. The patient is 14 years old, and the breast enlargement is bilateral and located beneath the nipple-areolar complex.
Next, I need to consider the patient's pubic hair development, which is Tanner stage 3. This suggests that the patient is in the early stages of puberty.
Now, I need to consider the patient's serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone, which are within the reference ranges. This suggests that the patient's hormone levels are normal for his age.
Considering the patient's age, physical examination findings, and normal hormone levels, the most likely cause of the breast enlargement is normal development. This is because breast enlargement is a normal part of male puberty, and the patient's hormone levels are within the reference ranges.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 37-year-old man comes to the physician because of nonradiating low back pain for 3 days. The pain began after he worked in his yard. He has not had any change in bowel movements or urination. He had one similar episode 3 years ago that resolved spontaneously. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the back shows bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm. Range of motion is limited by pain. Straight-leg raising is negative. In addition to analgesia, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Choices: a) Bed rest b) Regular activity c) X-rays of the spine d) MRI of the spine 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and history. The patient has nonradiating low back pain that began after physical activity, which is a common cause of acute back pain.
Next, I need to consider the patient's physical examination. The patient has bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm and limited range of motion, which are consistent with acute back pain.
Now, I need to consider the patient's history of similar episodes. The patient had one similar episode 3 years ago that resolved spontaneously, which suggests that the patient may have a chronic condition such as mechanical back pain.
Based on these considerations, the most appropriate next step in management is to recommend regular activity, as bed rest is not recommended for acute back pain and X-rays and MRI are not necessary for a patient with a history of similar episodes that resolved spontaneously.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 29-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because she has had increasingly severe lower abdominal pain and nausea for the past 2 days. She is sexually active and does not use any contraception. Her last menstrual period ended 6 days ago. Temperature is 38.3°C (101.0°F). Physical examination discloses abdominal tenderness in the lower quadrants bilaterally with rebound and guarding. Pelvic examination discloses leukorrhea at the cervical os and tenderness of the uterus to palpation. The adnexal areas are tender but no masses are palpable. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnostic study? Choices: a) Cervical culture b) Culdocentesis c) Laparoscopy d) Serum β-hCG concentration 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has severe lower abdominal pain, nausea, and fever, which suggests a possible infection or inflammatory process.
Next, I need to consider the patient's sexual activity and lack of contraception, which increases the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and ectopic pregnancy.
The patient's last menstrual period ended 6 days ago, which is within the timeframe for a possible ectopic pregnancy.
The physical examination findings of leukorrhea at the cervical os and tenderness of the uterus to palpation suggest a possible pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or ectopic pregnancy.
Considering the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most appropriate diagnostic study would be to check for pregnancy and STIs.
Therefore, the most appropriate diagnostic study is to check the serum β-hCG concentration to rule out ectopic pregnancy, which is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 57-year-old woman comes to the office for a preoperative evaluation 2 weeks before undergoing scheduled laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable and the patient takes no medications. Family history is significant for stable angina in her father and rheumatoid arthritis in her mother. The patient has a 102-year-old grandmother who resides in a nursing care facility and has Parkinson disease. The patient does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcoholic beverages. During the interview, her face is expressionless. She has a flexed posture and is unable to open her mouth wide. She is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 81 kg (179 lb); BMI is 27 kg/m2. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses thickening and hardening of the skin over the dorsum of the hands and forearms, as well as mild kyphosis. Strength testing shows no abnormalities; muscle tension is normal. Passive and active range of motion of the upper extremities is full. Gait is slow and deliberate. The remainder of the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Prior to surgery, further evaluation is indicated for which of the following conditions in this patient? Choices: a) Parkinson disease b) Progressive supranuclear palsy c) Sarcopenia d) Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key findings in the patient's history and physical examination. The patient has a significant family history of stable angina and rheumatoid arthritis, but these conditions are not directly relevant to the patient's current presentation. The patient's grandmother has Parkinson disease, but this is not directly relevant to the patient's current presentation either. The patient does not smoke or drink, which reduces her risk for certain conditions. During the interview, the patient's face is expressionless, which could be a sign of depression or other neurological condition. She has a flexed posture and is unable to open her mouth wide, which could be a sign of a musculoskeletal or neurological condition. She has a normal BMI, but her skin is thickened and hardened over the dorsum of her hands and forearms, which could be a sign of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). Her strength testing is normal, but her gait is slow and deliberate, which could be a sign of a neurological or musculoskeletal condition. The remainder of the physical examination is normal.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of the patient's symptoms. The patient's expressionless face and flexed posture could be caused by a variety of conditions, including depression, Parkinson disease, or progressive supranuclear palsy. The patient's thickened and hardened skin could be caused by systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). The patient's slow and deliberate gait could be caused by a variety of conditions, including Parkinson disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, or sarcopenia.
Finally, I need to consider the patient's age and medical history. The patient is 57 years old and has no significant medical history, which reduces her risk for certain conditions. However, her family history of stable angina and rheumatoid arthritis may increase her risk for certain conditions.
Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely condition that requires further evaluation is systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). The patient's thickened and hardened skin is a classic sign of this condition, and it is more likely to be caused by systemic sclerosis than by the other conditions listed.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 40-year-old man comes to the office for a preemployment physical examination. The patient has been generally healthy. Medical history is unremarkable and he takes no routine medications. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows a palpable nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is within the reference range. Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland confirms a solid, 1-cm nodule. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation? Choices: a) CT scan of the neck b) Fine-needle aspiration of the nodule c) Radionuclide thyroid scan d) Thyroidectomy 
Output:
First, I need to determine the size of the nodule. The nodule is 1 cm in size.
Next, I need to consider the patient's age and the characteristics of the nodule. The patient is 40 years old, and the nodule is solid and 1 cm in size.
Now, I need to consider the guidelines for the evaluation of thyroid nodules. According to the guidelines, a solid nodule that is 1 cm or larger in size should undergo fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for cytological evaluation.

"Input: A male neonate, who was born at 36 weeks' gestation 2 hours ago in the labor and delivery unit of the hospital, now shows signs of respiratory difficulty. The mother, an 18-year-old primigravid woman, smoked one pack of cigarettes daily throughout her pregnancy. She received prenatal care during most of the pregnancy. One episode of chlamydial cervicitis was detected during the last trimester and treated with azithromycin. The neonate was born via cesarean delivery due to fetal heart rate decelerations. The amniotic fluid was stained with light particulate meconium. Apgar scores were 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The patient is 50 cm (20 in; 50th percentile) long and weighs 3005 g (6 lb 10 oz; 50th percentile); head circumference is 35 cm (14 in; 50th percentile). The infant's vital signs now are temperature 36.6°C (97.8°F), pulse 150/min, and respirations 70/min. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Physical examination discloses mild subcostal and intercostal retractions. Chest x-ray shows prominent pulmonary vascular markings and fluid in the intralobar fissures. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Choices: a) Group B streptococcal sepsis b) Meconium aspiration syndrome c) Respiratory distress syndrome d) Transient tachypnea of newborn 
Output:
First, I need to consider the gestational age of the neonate, which is 36 weeks. This is a preterm birth, which increases the risk of respiratory distress.
Next, I need to consider the presence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, which is a risk factor for meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS).
However, the neonate's Apgar scores are high, and the physical examination shows mild retractions, which is not typical of MAS.
The chest x-ray shows fluid in the intralobar fissures, which is consistent with transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN).
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A study is conducted to assess the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 1000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are enrolled. Patients are randomly assigned to receive the new drug or standard treatment. The alpha and beta values for calculating probability are 0.05 and 0.20, respectively. Results show that the new drug is significantly better than standard treatment. If this study had been performed in a population of only 500 patients, which of the following would have been most likely to increase? Choices: a) Chance of a type I error b) Chance of a type II error c) Power of the study d) Sensitivity of the study 
Output:
First, I need to understand the given information. The study is conducted to assess the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 1000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are enrolled. Patients are randomly assigned to receive the new drug or standard treatment. The alpha and beta values for calculating probability are 0.05 and 0.20, respectively. Results show that the new drug is significantly better than standard treatment.
Next, I need to consider the effect of reducing the sample size from 1000 to 500 patients. With a smaller sample size, the study will have less statistical power to detect significant differences between the new drug and standard treatment.
Now, I need to determine which of the given options would be most likely to increase. A smaller sample size would increase the chance of a type II error, as the study would be less likely to detect significant differences between the new drug and standard treatment.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 78-year-old male presents to the office with the complaint of severe neck pain. He rates the pain as a 7 on a scale of 0 to 10 scale. He denies any trauma but reports that he had been doing a lot of painting over the past week. He denies any radicular pain or numbness. Cervical range of motion is moderately limited in all fields. He is treated with articulatory springing technique. Four hours later the physician receives a call from the local emergency department, where the patient presented confused, nauseated, and vertiginous. The physician may be found liable if Choices: a) the motion barrier was articulated more than 3 times b) the motion barrier was met with a vectored force from the direction of ease c) the neck was treated in simultaneous hyperrotation and extension d) the patient was previously treated for osteoarthritis of the cervical spine 
Output:
First, I need to identify the potential cause of the patient's symptoms. The patient was treated with articulatory springing technique, which involves applying a force to the joint to restore motion. However, the patient's symptoms worsened after treatment, suggesting that the treatment may have caused further injury.
Next, I need to consider the potential risks associated with the treatment. The patient's symptoms of confusion, nausea, and vertigo suggest that the treatment may have caused a vertebral artery dissection, which is a known complication of cervical spine manipulation.
Now, I need to consider the potential liability of the physician. The physician may be liable if they failed to obtain informed consent from the patient, failed to properly assess the patient's condition, or failed to use proper technique.
Considering the options, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is the use of a vectored force from the direction of ease, which can increase the risk of vertebral artery dissection. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A physician is conducting a retrospective review of a trial involving the use of Drug X in patients with a specific disease. It is known that Drug X is associated with an increased probability of cancer in patients who use the drug. A total of 600 individuals with a specific disease were included in the trial. Of the participants, 200 individuals received Drug X and 400 individuals did not receive it. One hundred individuals who received Drug X died of a particular type of cancer and 100 individuals who did not receive the drug died of the same type of cancer. Based on these data, which of the following is the relative risk of death from this type of cancer in individuals who take Drug X as compared with individuals who do not take Drug X? Choices: a) Individuals who take Drug X have an equal risk of dying from this type of cancer b) Individuals who take Drug X have four times the risk of dying from this type of cancer c) Individuals who take Drug X have three times the risk of dying from this type of cancer d) Individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer 
Output:
First, I need to calculate the number of individuals who did not die of cancer in each group. For the group that received Drug X, the number of individuals who did not die of cancer is 200 - 100 = 100 individuals. For the group that did not receive Drug X, the number of individuals who did not die of cancer is 400 - 100 = 300 individuals.
Next, I need to calculate the risk of death from cancer in each group. The risk of death from cancer in the group that received Drug X is 100/200 = 0.5. The risk of death from cancer in the group that did not receive Drug X is 100/400 = 0.25.
Now, I need to calculate the relative risk of death from cancer in individuals who take Drug X as compared with individuals who do not take Drug X. The relative risk is the ratio of the risk of death from cancer in the group that received Drug X to the risk of death from cancer in the group that did not receive Drug X: 0.5 / 0.25 = 2.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-year history of chronic diarrhea and intermittent, crampy, lower abdominal pain. The pain is usually relieved with defecation and does not occur at night or interfere with sleep. She says she is frustrated by her symptoms and has stopped traveling because of her frequent, urgent need to use the bathroom. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. The lower abdomen is mildly tender to palpation; there is no rebound tenderness or guarding. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Results of laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Antigliadin antibodies are not present. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? Choices: a) Nefazodone b) Nortriptyline c) Phenelzine d) Sertraline 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient has a 3-year history of chronic diarrhea and intermittent, crampy, lower abdominal pain. The pain is usually relieved with defecation and does not occur at night or interfere with sleep. The patient also has a frequent, urgent need to use the bathroom, which has led her to stop traveling.
Next, I need to consider the patient's medical history and laboratory results. The patient has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. The results of laboratory studies are within the reference ranges, and the test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Antigliadin antibodies are not present, which suggests that the patient does not have celiac disease.
Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, I suspect that the patient has irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, and other symptoms that are not explained by any underlying medical condition.
The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for IBS is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) such as nortriptyline. TCAs have been shown to be effective in reducing the symptoms of IBS, including abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits. They work by increasing the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain that help to regulate bowel function.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of acupuncture in children with chronic headaches. Sixty children with chronic headaches are recruited for the study. In addition to their usual therapy, all children are treated with acupuncture three times a week for 2 months. Which of the following best describes this study design? Choices: a) Case-control b) Case series c) Crossover d) Cross-sectional 
Output:
First, I need to understand the study design. The study is evaluating the effect of acupuncture on children with chronic headaches.
Next, I need to identify the type of study design. The study is not a case-control study because it is not comparing two groups with and without a specific exposure.
The study is not a cross-sectional study because it is not evaluating a population at a single point in time.
The study is not a crossover study because it is not comparing two different treatments in the same subjects.
The study is a case series because it is a descriptive study of a group of patients with a specific condition who are treated with a specific intervention.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: A 17-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after being stung by a bee. She has mild lightheadedness but no difficulty swallowing. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no urticaria. Bilateral wheezing is heard on auscultation of the chest. Which of the following types of drugs is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient? Choices: a) α1-Adrenergic agonist b) α2-Adrenergic agonist c) α1-Adrenergic antagonist d) β2-Adrenergic agonist 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms and the situation. The patient is a 17-year-old girl who has been stung by a bee and is experiencing mild lightheadedness, bilateral wheezing, and no urticaria.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these symptoms. The patient's symptoms are consistent with anaphylaxis, a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction.
Now, I need to consider the appropriate pharmacotherapy for anaphylaxis. The most effective treatment for anaphylaxis is epinephrine, which is a β2-adrenergic agonist.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Five years after being shot in the right thigh, a 21-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a buzzing sensation adjacent to the scar. At the time of the initial wound, he was discharged after 6 hours of observation with no fractures or soft-tissue swelling. A loud murmur is heard on auscultation; there is a thrill. He has dilated varicose veins with incompetent valves in the lower leg. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Choices: a) Arterial spasm b) Arteriovenous fistula c) Deep venous thrombosis d) Occlusion of the superficial femoral artery 
Output:
First, I need to consider the symptoms presented. The patient has a buzzing sensation adjacent to the scar, a loud murmur, a thrill, and dilated varicose veins with incompetent valves in the lower leg.
These symptoms suggest a vascular issue related to the initial wound.
Given the history of being shot in the thigh, it is likely that the bullet damaged a blood vessel.
The presence of a loud murmur and a thrill suggests abnormal blood flow, which is consistent with an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein.
Considering the options, arterial spasm (a) is unlikely because it would not cause a loud murmur or a thrill.
Deep venous thrombosis (c) is also unlikely because it would not cause a loud murmur or a thrill.
Occlusion of the superficial femoral artery (d) is unlikely because it would not cause dilated varicose veins with incompetent valves.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is an arteriovenous fistula (b).
{'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A previously healthy 40-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of constant substernal chest pain for 12 hours that is exacerbated by coughing and inspiration. The pain is relieved with sitting up and leaning forward. There is no family history of heart disease. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows distant heart sounds. An ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads. An x-ray of the chest shows normal findings. The most likely cause of his condition is injury to which of the following tissues? Choices: a) Aortic intima b) Esophageal sphincter c) Myocardium d) Pericardium 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms presented by the patient. The patient has substernal chest pain that is exacerbated by coughing and inspiration, but relieved by sitting up and leaning forward. This is a classic symptom of a condition known as aortic dissection, but it can also be a symptom of a condition known as esophageal spasm or esophagitis. However, the fact that the pain is relieved by sitting up and leaning forward is more suggestive of a condition that involves the esophagus.
Next, I need to consider the patient's physical examination findings. The patient has a fever, tachycardia, and distant heart sounds. These findings are suggestive of a condition that involves inflammation of the pericardium, but they can also be seen in conditions that involve the myocardium or the pericardium.
Now, I need to consider the patient's diagnostic test results. The ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads, which is suggestive of a condition that involves the myocardium. However, the chest x-ray shows normal findings, which makes a condition that involves the aorta or the pericardium less likely.
Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and diagnostic test results, the most likely cause of his condition is injury to the pericardium. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 24-year-old man comes to the office because of a 2-day history of a red, itchy rash on his buttocks and legs. Four days ago, he returned from a cruise to the Caribbean, during which he swam in the ship’s pool and used the hot tub. He appears well. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows the findings in the photograph. The infectious agent causing these findings most likely began to proliferate in which of the following locations? Choices: a) Apocrine gland b) Dermis c) Eccrine gland d) Hair follicle 
Output:
First, I need to identify the type of rash. The rash is described as red and itchy, and it is located on the buttocks and legs. This suggests that the rash is likely caused by a bacterial or fungal infection.
Next, I need to consider the patient's recent activities. The patient recently returned from a cruise and used the hot tub and pool. This suggests that the rash may be caused by a waterborne pathogen.
Now, I need to consider the anatomy of the skin. The apocrine glands are located in the armpits and groin area, and are not typically associated with itchy rashes. The dermis is the layer of skin beneath the epidermis, and is not typically associated with itchy rashes. The eccrine glands are located all over the body, and are responsible for sweating. However, they are not typically associated with itchy rashes. The hair follicles are the openings of the hair shafts, and are a common site for itchy rashes, such as folliculitis.
Based on the patient's symptoms and recent activities, and the anatomy of the skin, the most likely location where the infectious agent began to proliferate is the hair follicle.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 10-month-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 4-day history of fever and cough. His illness began with lowgrade fever and copious, clear nasal discharge. Two days ago he developed a moist, nonproductive cough and rapid breathing. He has received all scheduled childhood immunizations. He attends a large day-care center and has three schoolaged siblings. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 38/min, and blood pressure is 85/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows nasal flaring and rhinorrhea. Chest examination shows intercostal retractions along with bilateral, diffuse wheezes and expiratory rhonchi. The infectious agent of this patient's condition most likely has which of the following properties? Choices: a) DNA genome b) Double-stranded nucleic acid genome c) Mature virion lacking viral polymerase d) Mediation of cell entry via a fusion protein 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms and the patient's condition. The patient is a 10-month-old boy with a 4-day history of fever and cough, and he has developed a moist, nonproductive cough and rapid breathing. He has a history of low-grade fever and copious, clear nasal discharge, and he has nasal flaring and rhinorrhea. The chest examination shows intercostal retractions along with bilateral, diffuse wheezes and expiratory rhonchi.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of the patient's condition. The patient has received all scheduled childhood immunizations, and he attends a large day-care center and has three school-aged siblings, which suggests that the condition may be contagious.
Now, I need to consider the properties of the infectious agent. The patient's symptoms, such as wheezes and expiratory rhonchi, suggest that the condition may be a respiratory infection. The fact that the patient has received all scheduled childhood immunizations suggests that the condition may be caused by a virus, as the patient is not yet eligible for a vaccine against the most common cause of respiratory infections in children.
Considering the properties of the infectious agent, I can eliminate options a and b, as the most common cause of respiratory infections in children has a single-stranded RNA genome. I can also eliminate option c, as the mature virion of the most common cause of respiratory infections in children does contain viral polymerase. Finally, I can eliminate option d, as the most common cause of respiratory infections in children does not mediate cell entry via a fusion protein.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 29-year-old woman is prescribed carbamazepine for trigeminal neuralgia. She has a strong family history of osteoporosis. As a result, the physician also advises her to increase her intake of vitamin D. The most likely reason for this recommendation is that carbamazepine may affect which of the following pharmacokinetic processes? Choices: a) Absorption b) Distribution c) Excretion d) Metabolism 
Output:
First, I need to understand the relationship between carbamazepine and vitamin D. Carbamazepine is known to affect the metabolism of vitamin D, leading to decreased levels of vitamin D in the body.
Next, I need to consider the impact of decreased vitamin D levels on the patient's health. Vitamin D is essential for bone health, and decreased levels can increase the risk of osteoporosis.
Now, I need to determine which pharmacokinetic process is most likely affected by carbamazepine. Since carbamazepine affects the metabolism of vitamin D, the most likely affected process is metabolism.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 57-year-old man receives radiation therapy for a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Despite therapy, the tumor progressively increases in size, and he dies 6 months later. His tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53 gene (TP53), leading to an inactive gene product. Based on this finding, the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely to be related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in which of the following phases of the cell cycle? Choices: a) G0 b) G1 c) G2 d) M 
Output:
First, I need to understand the role of the p53 gene in the cell cycle. The p53 gene is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a crucial role in preventing cancer by stopping cells with damaged DNA from dividing.
Next, I need to identify the phase of the cell cycle where p53 exerts its effect. The p53 gene is activated in response to DNA damage, and it induces cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, allowing the cell to repair the damage or undergo apoptosis if the damage is too severe.
Now, I need to consider the impact of the point mutation in the p53 gene on the cell cycle. The mutation leads to an inactive p53 gene product, which means that the cell cycle arrest function is impaired, allowing damaged cells to continue dividing and contributing to tumor growth.
Therefore, the defect in cell cycle arrest is most likely related to a defect in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: An 87-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her son because of progressive memory loss over the past 2 years. Her son says that she repeats herself frequently and has been forgetting to take her routine medications. She takes hydrochlorothiazide for mild systolic hypertension and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. She had vulvar cancer 10 years ago treated with wide excision. Her blood pressure is 138/78 mm Hg. Physical examination is within normal limits for her age. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 23/30. Laboratory studies, including serum vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), thyroxine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations, are within normal limits. A CT scan of the head shows mild volume loss. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? Choices: a) β-Adrenergic agonist b) Cholinesterase inhibitor c) Dopamine agonist d) Prednisone 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's condition. The patient is an 87-year-old woman with progressive memory loss over the past 2 years, which is a common symptom of dementia.
Next, I need to consider the patient's medical history. The patient has a history of vulvar cancer, but it was treated 10 years ago, and there is no indication that it is related to her current symptoms.
Now, I need to consider the patient's laboratory results. The patient's laboratory studies, including serum vitamin B12, thyroxine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations, are within normal limits, which suggests that her memory loss is not due to a vitamin deficiency or thyroid disorder.
The patient's Mini-Mental State Examination score is 23/30, which indicates mild cognitive impairment.
Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is a cholinesterase inhibitor, which is a common treatment for mild cognitive impairment and dementia.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A male stillborn is delivered at 32 weeks' gestation to a 30-year-old woman. The pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios. Examination of the stillborn shows the absence of a urethral opening. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this stillborn? Choices: a) Congenital diaphragmatic hernia b) Intralobar sequestration c) Pulmonary hypoplasia d) Situs inversus 
Output:
First, I need to understand the given information. The stillborn was delivered at 32 weeks' gestation, which is a relatively early gestational age. The pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios, which is a condition characterized by a decrease in the amount of amniotic fluid.
Next, I need to consider the implications of oligohydramnios. Oligohydramnios is often associated with renal anomalies, as the kidneys play a crucial role in producing amniotic fluid. The absence of a urethral opening in the stillborn suggests a possible renal anomaly.
Now, I need to consider the options. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (a) is a condition where there is a hole in the diaphragm, which can be associated with other anomalies, but it is not directly related to oligohydramnios. Intralobar sequestration (b) is a type of lung anomaly, but it is not directly related to oligohydramnios. Pulmonary hypoplasia (c) is a condition where the lungs are underdeveloped, which can be associated with oligohydramnios due to the decreased amniotic fluid volume. Situs inversus (d) is a condition where the organs are reversed, but it is not directly related to oligohydramnios.
Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this stillborn is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A couple comes for preconceptional genetic counseling because they both have a family history of α-thalassemia. The woman has a minimally decreased hemoglobin concentration. Genetic studies show a single gene deletion. The man has microcytic anemia and a two-gene deletion. If the two-gene deletion is in trans (one deletion on the maternal gene and one deletion on the paternal gene), which of the following percentages of their offspring will have a two-gene deletion? Choices: a) 0% b) 25% c) 50% d) 75% 
Output:
First, I need to understand the genetic basis of α-thalassemia. α-thalassemia is caused by deletions in the HBA1 and HBA2 genes, which are located on chromosome 16. Each gene has two alleles, one inherited from each parent.
The woman has a single gene deletion, which means she is a carrier of α-thalassemia. She has one normal allele and one deleted allele.
The man has microcytic anemia and a two-gene deletion, which means he is homozygous for α-thalassemia. He has two deleted alleles.
Since the two-gene deletion is in trans, one deletion is on the maternal gene and one deletion is on the paternal gene. This means the man contributes one deleted allele and the woman contributes one normal allele.
When the offspring inherit one deleted allele from the man and one normal allele from the woman, they will be carriers of α-thalassemia, just like the woman.
However, when the offspring inherit one deleted allele from the man and one deleted allele from the woman, they will have a two-gene deletion, which is the same genotype as the man.
Since the man contributes one deleted allele and the woman contributes one normal allele, the probability of the offspring inheriting one deleted allele from the man and one deleted allele from the woman is 50%.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 27-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 12 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal visit. She feels well. Pregnancy and delivery of her first child were uncomplicated. Medications include folic acid and a multivitamin. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), and blood pressure is 108/60 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 12-week gestation. Urine dipstick shows leukocyte esterase; urinalysis shows WBCs and rare gram-negative rods. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Choices: a) Recommend drinking 8 oz of cranberry juice daily b) Oral amoxicillin therapy c) Oral metronidazole therapy d) Intravenous cefazolin therapy 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient is a 27-year-old woman who is 12 weeks pregnant and has a history of uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. She is currently taking folic acid and a multivitamin.
Next, I need to analyze the patient's current symptoms and test results. The patient feels well, but the urine dipstick shows leukocyte esterase, and the urinalysis shows WBCs and rare gram-negative rods. This suggests a urinary tract infection (UTI).
Now, I need to consider the appropriate treatment for a UTI in pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends treating UTIs in pregnancy with amoxicillin or nitrofurantoin. However, the patient's urine dipstick shows gram-negative rods, which may indicate a more resistant infection.
Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to start oral amoxicillin therapy, as it is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that can cover a wide range of bacteria, including gram-negative rods. {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 5-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents for evaluation of recurrent injuries. Her parents say that she started walking at the age of 14 months and since then has always seemed clumsier and had more injuries than other children. She has had increasingly frequent chest pain with exertion since starting a soccer program 3 months ago. She usually has pain or swelling of her knees or ankles after practice. She has been wearing glasses for 2 years. Her 16-year-old brother has required two operations for a severe rotator cuff injury he sustained while taking a shower, and she has a maternal cousin who died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 26 years. Today, the patient walks with a limp. She is at the 99th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. A midsystolic click is heard at the apex. The left ankle is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain. The joints of the upper and lower extremities are hypermobile, including 25 degrees of genu recurvatum, thumbs that may be extended to touch the forearms, and flexibility at the waist, with palms easily touching the floor with straight knees. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis? Choices: a) Skeletal survey b) Echocardiography c) Bone scan d) MRI of the shoulder 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and family history. The patient has a history of recurrent injuries, chest pain with exertion, and joint hypermobility. Her brother has a history of a severe rotator cuff injury, and her maternal cousin died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm. These findings suggest a possible genetic disorder.
Next, I need to consider the patient's physical examination findings. The patient has a limp, swollen and tender left ankle, and hypermobile joints. These findings are consistent with a connective tissue disorder.
Now, I need to consider the most appropriate next step in diagnosis. Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an echocardiogram to evaluate the patient's heart function. The patient has a midsystolic click at the apex, which may indicate mitral valve prolapse, a common feature of Marfan syndrome.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: A 42-year-old woman comes to the physician because of an 8-week history of intermittent nausea and abdominal pain that occurs 20 to 30 minutes after eating. The pain extends from the epigastrium to the right upper quadrant and is sometimes felt in the right scapula; it lasts about 30 minutes and is not relieved by antacids. The last episode occurred after she ate a hamburger and french fries. She has not had vomiting. She is currently asymptomatic. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 104 kg (230 lb); BMI is 38 kg/m2. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Choices: a) Abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant b) Upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through c) CT scan of the abdomen d) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms. The patient experiences intermittent nausea and abdominal pain that occurs 20 to 30 minutes after eating, which is relieved by neither antacids nor vomiting. The pain is located in the epigastrium and right upper quadrant and radiates to the right scapula. This pattern of pain is suggestive of gallbladder disease, specifically biliary colic.
Next, I need to consider the patient's risk factors. The patient is a 42-year-old woman with a BMI of 38 kg/m2, which puts her at increased risk for gallstones. The patient's symptoms and risk factors suggest that the most likely diagnosis is gallstones.
Now, I need to consider the appropriate next step in management. Given the patient's symptoms and risk factors, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform an abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant to confirm the presence of gallstones. This is because ultrasonography is a non-invasive and relatively inexpensive test that can accurately diagnose gallstones.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: A 22-year-old male presents to the office with a 5-day history of diarrhea after completing his third course of antibiotics for mastoiditis. Physical examination reveals vague generalized abdominal pain on palpation. Culture on hektoen enteric agar is positive. The most likely etiologic agent causing the diarrhea is Choices: a) Clostridium difficile b) Entamoeba histolytica c) Giardia lamblia d) Salmonella typhi 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key information in the question. The patient has a history of diarrhea after completing a course of antibiotics, and the culture on hektoen enteric agar is positive.
Next, I need to consider the common causes of diarrhea after antibiotic use. The most common cause is Clostridium difficile (C. diff), which is a type of bacteria that can overgrow in the gut after antibiotic use.
Now, I need to consider the other options. Entamoeba histolytica is a parasite that can cause diarrhea, but it is not typically associated with antibiotic use. Giardia lamblia is also a parasite that can cause diarrhea, but it is not typically associated with antibiotic use. Salmonella typhi is a type of bacteria that can cause diarrhea, but it is not typically associated with antibiotic use.
Therefore, the most likely etiologic agent causing the diarrhea is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: A 15-year-old male is brought to the office with a 2-day history of painful swelling over the sacral prominence that began after a fall during a high school wrestling match. The patient has a low-grade fever. Examination reveals an erythematous, fluctuant, elevated mass with 3 midline pores. Rectal examination reveals no induration or pain. The most likely diagnosis is Choices: a) anocutaneous fistula b) coccygodynia c) hidradenitis suppurativa d) pilonidal abscess 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key symptoms of the case. The patient has a painful swelling over the sacral prominence, which began after a fall, and has a low-grade fever. The examination reveals an erythematous, fluctuant, elevated mass with 3 midline pores.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these symptoms. The patient's history of a fall and the location of the swelling suggest a traumatic injury. The presence of midline pores and a fluctuant mass suggests a skin infection or abscess.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) anocutaneous fistula is a type of anal fistula, which is a chronic condition that is not typically associated with a recent fall or a fluctuant mass. Option b) coccygodynia is a condition characterized by pain in the coccyx, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Option c) hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic skin condition that can cause painful nodules, but it is not typically associated with a recent fall or a fluctuant mass. Option d) pilonidal abscess is a type of skin abscess that occurs in the natal cleft, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: You are visiting an 86-year-old woman in her home at the request of the patient's daughter because of worsening shortness of breath at rest for the past 2 days. The patient is confined to her home because of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with cor pulmonale. She was discharged 1 week ago from the hospital following 3 weeks of treatment for pneumonia that required intubation; her hospital stay was complicated by sepsis. She had a prolonged weaning program from intubation. Prior to discharge, the patient and her daughter met with you to review the patient's advance directive. During the discussion, the patient said, ""I'd rather die than be intubated again."" At that time, both the patient and her daughter signed an addendum to that effect on the patient's advance directive. Today, the patient is dyspneic and is unable to complete a sentence. Vital signs are temperature 37.8°C (100.0°F), pulse 88/min, respirations 35/min, and blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 84% while the patient is breathing 4 L of oxygen. You ask the patient if she wishes to return to the hospital. She says, ""No, I want to die at home."" Her daughter takes you aside and says, ""My mother doesn't know what she's saying. I insist that she be admitted to the hospital."" After further discussion with the daughter regarding support available at home, which of the following is the most appropriate step? Choices: a) Admit the patient to the hospital b) Arrange for consultation with a home hospice team c) Consult with the hospital ethics committee d) Order a home continuous positive airway pressure machine and instruct the daughter in its use 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's advance directive, which states that she would rather die than be intubated again. This suggests that she has a clear preference for not wanting aggressive medical interventions.
Next, I need to consider the patient's current condition, which includes worsening shortness of breath at rest, a high respiratory rate, and low oxygen saturation despite supplemental oxygen. This suggests that the patient is experiencing significant distress and may be nearing the end of life.
Now, I need to consider the daughter's request to admit the patient to the hospital, which may be motivated by a desire to save her mother's life rather than respecting her wishes. However, the patient's advance directive and current condition suggest that hospitalization may not be in the patient's best interest.
Therefore, the most appropriate step is to arrange for consultation with a home hospice team, which can provide support and care to the patient in her home while respecting her wishes and preferences. {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 37-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-day history of throbbing facial pain. She describes the pain as 7 out of 10 in intensity. Over the past 9 days, she has had nasal congestion, purulent nasal discharge, sore throat, and a nonproductive cough. She does not smoke. Her husband and children have had no recent illness. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F). Examination shows congested nasal mucosa and purulent discharge on the left. There is tenderness to palpation over the left cheek and no transillumination over the left maxillary sinus. The tympanic membranes are normal, and there is no erythema of the throat. Examination shows no cervical adenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism? Choices: a) Haemophilus influenzae type b b) Moraxella catarrhalis c) Staphylococcus aureus d) Streptococcus pneumoniae 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms presented by the patient. The patient has a 1-day history of throbbing facial pain, nasal congestion, purulent nasal discharge, sore throat, and a nonproductive cough. The patient also has a fever of 38.5°C (101.3°F).
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these symptoms. The patient's symptoms are consistent with sinusitis, which is an infection of the sinuses.
Now, I need to consider the possible causal organisms of sinusitis. The most common causal organisms of sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.
However, the patient's symptoms are more severe than typical sinusitis, and the patient has a fever, which suggests a more serious infection. Therefore, the most likely causal organism is Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 42-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 10 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was a restrained passenger. On arrival, she has shortness of breath and abdominal pain. Her pulse is 135/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 80/40 mm Hg. Breath sounds are decreased at the left lung base. An x-ray of the chest shows opacification of the left lower lung field with loss of the diaphragmatic shadow. Placement of a chest tube yields a small amount of air followed by greenish fluid. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Choices: a) CT scan of the abdomen b) CT scan of the chest c) Thoracoscopy d) Laparotomy 
Output:
First, I need to assess the patient's condition. The patient is a 42-year-old woman who was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision and is experiencing shortness of breath and abdominal pain. Her vital signs are tachycardic (135/min) and hypotensive (80/40 mm Hg), indicating shock.
Next, I need to consider the patient's chest x-ray findings. The opacification of the left lower lung field with loss of the diaphragmatic shadow suggests a pneumothorax or hemothorax.
Given the patient's condition and the chest x-ray findings, the most appropriate next step in management is to place a chest tube to drain the air and fluid from the thoracic cavity.
However, the chest tube placement yielded a small amount of air followed by greenish fluid, which suggests a hemothorax. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform a CT scan of the chest to further evaluate the extent of the hemothorax and to identify any potential sources of bleeding.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 19-year-old woman who is a regular patient comes to the office for her annual physical examination and cervical cytology. She tells you that she has not had a menstrual period for the past 6 months. She is a college student who is in good health, has not had any medical illnesses or surgery, and has never been pregnant. She is currently sexually active and uses barrier contraception. She reports that during the past year her menses had become very irregular prior to complete cessation 6 months ago. She also notes that she has gained about 9 kg (20 lb) in the past 6 months and has had an increasing problem with acne and a troublesome growth of hair on her thighs and abdomen. She has been somewhat depressed about this, and her grades have declined. She reports that one of her sisters also had this problem prior to getting married. Physical examination shows a mildly obese young woman who has scattered facial acne, mild male pattern hair growth on the abdomen, and an essentially normal pelvic examination except for slight enlargement of the uterus and both ovaries. This patient's history is most consistent with which of the following? Choices: a) Androgen-producing ovarian tumor b) Cushing syndrome c) Hypothyroidism d) Polycystic ovarian syndrome 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key symptoms presented by the patient. The patient is a 19-year-old woman who has not had a menstrual period for the past 6 months, has gained 9 kg in the past 6 months, has acne, and has excessive hair growth on her thighs and abdomen.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these symptoms. The patient's symptoms could be related to hormonal imbalances, particularly an excess of androgens (male hormones).
Now, I need to evaluate the options provided. Option a) Androgen-producing ovarian tumor is a possible cause of the patient's symptoms, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the fact that she has a family history of similar symptoms. Option b) Cushing syndrome is a condition caused by excess cortisol, which can lead to weight gain and acne, but it is not typically associated with excessive hair growth. Option c) Hypothyroidism is a condition caused by an underactive thyroid gland, which can lead to weight gain and hair loss, but it is not typically associated with excessive hair growth. Option d) Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a condition characterized by hormonal imbalances, particularly an excess of androgens, which can lead to irregular menstrual periods, weight gain, acne, and excessive hair growth.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 44-year-old female presents to the office for evaluation of a lump on her neck that she noted 1 week ago. She denies any tenderness, fever, weight loss, or fatigue. Physical examination reveals a 2-cm freely movable mass in the lower left lobe of the thyroid. In addition to thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine levels, the most appropriate initial method to investigate this lesion is Choices: a) a nuclear thyroid scan b) an iodine131\xa0scan c) fine-needle aspiration d) ultrasonography of the thyroid gland 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient is a 44-year-old female with a 2-cm freely movable mass in the lower left lobe of the thyroid. She denies any tenderness, fever, weight loss, or fatigue.
Next, I need to consider the appropriate initial method to investigate this lesion. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a thyroid nodule, which requires further evaluation.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. A nuclear thyroid scan (option a) can help determine if the nodule is functioning or non-functioning, but it is not the most appropriate initial method. An iodine-131 scan (option b) is typically used to evaluate thyroid cancer, but it is not the most appropriate initial method for a thyroid nodule. Fine-needle aspiration (option c) is a diagnostic procedure that can help determine if the nodule is benign or malignant, but it is not the most appropriate initial method. Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland (option d) is a non-invasive imaging test that can help evaluate the size, location, and characteristics of the nodule, making it the most appropriate initial method.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 22-year-old woman comes to the office because of a 3-day history of cold symptoms and a 1-week history of progressive fatigue. Six weeks ago, she received a kidney transplant from a living, related donor. Immediately after the operation, she received monoclonal anti-CD3 therapy. Current medications are azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone. Her temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Physical examination shows a well-healed surgical scar. Serum studies show that her urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations have tripled. A diagnosis of allograft rejection is suspected. In addition, this patient's clinical presentation is best explained by an infection with which of the following agents? Choices: a) Adenovirus b) BK virus c) Epstein-Barr virus d) Herpes simplex virus 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient has a history of a kidney transplant and is currently experiencing cold symptoms and progressive fatigue.
Next, I need to consider the patient's current medications and the fact that her urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations have tripled, indicating a possible rejection of the transplanted kidney.
However, the patient's high fever and the fact that her symptoms started 6 weeks after the transplant suggest that an infection is also a possibility.
Considering the patient's symptoms and medical history, I would suspect an infection with a virus that is known to cause fever and fatigue in immunocompromised patients.
Adenovirus is a common cause of fever and respiratory illness in immunocompromised patients, especially those who have received monoclonal anti-CD3 therapy.
BK virus is a common cause of nephropathy in kidney transplant recipients, but it typically presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms.
Epstein-Barr virus is a common cause of infectious mononucleosis, but it typically presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms and is less likely to cause a high fever.
Herpes simplex virus can cause a range of symptoms, including fever and fatigue, but it is less likely to cause a high fever in an immunocompromised patient.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of intermittent blood in his stool. He has had no pain with defecation. Physical examination shows a 1-cm, visible anal mass located below the dentate line. A biopsy of the mass is scheduled. If the mass if found to be malignant, it is most appropriate to evaluate which of the following lymph nodes for possible metastasis? Choices: a) Internal iliac b) Popliteal c) Sacral d) Superficial inguinal 
Output:
First, I need to identify the location of the anal mass. The mass is located below the dentate line, which is the boundary between the anal canal and the rectum.
Next, I need to determine the lymphatic drainage of the anal canal. The lymphatic drainage of the anal canal is primarily to the superficial inguinal lymph nodes.
Now, I need to consider the location of the lymph nodes listed in the choices. The internal iliac lymph nodes are located near the pelvic organs, the popliteal lymph nodes are located near the knee, and the sacral lymph nodes are located near the sacrum. None of these lymph nodes are directly related to the anal canal.
Therefore, the most appropriate lymph nodes to evaluate for possible metastasis are the superficial inguinal lymph nodes. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A study is being conducted to assess mesothelioma in shipyard workers. A large shipyard firm has provided the asbestos exposure records of all employees during the past 50 years. The health insurer for the workers has provided claims data that documents all chest x-rays and diagnoses of mesothelioma among current workers and retirees. The study enrolled shipyard workers who were diagnosed with mesothelioma and shipyard workers who were not diagnosed with mesothelioma. All subjects in the study had to have chest xrays. Which of the following is the best rationale for selecting a comparison group that had chest x-rays? Choices: a) Address confounding b) Demonstrate causality c) Minimize ascertainment bias d) Reduce recall bias 
Output:
First, I need to understand the goal of the study. The study aims to assess the relationship between asbestos exposure and the development of mesothelioma in shipyard workers.
Next, I need to consider the potential biases in the study. One potential bias is that workers who are diagnosed with mesothelioma may have had more chest x-rays than workers who are not diagnosed with mesothelioma, which could lead to an overestimation of the association between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma.
To address this bias, the study should select a comparison group that had chest x-rays, so that the comparison group is similar to the exposed group in terms of the number of chest x-rays.
This is an example of minimizing ascertainment bias, which occurs when the method of ascertaining the outcome (in this case, mesothelioma) differs between the exposed and unexposed groups.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 34-year-old woman comes to the office because of a 3- to 4-week history of swelling of her legs and a 9-kg (20-lb) weight gain. Medical history is significant for sickle cell trait and mild anemia. She has been taking 800 mg of ibuprofen three times daily for Achilles tendinitis diagnosed 1 month ago. She has smoked five cigarettes daily for the past 15 years, and she drinks one to five beers on weekends. She experimented with cocaine briefly 16 years ago, but she has never used intravenous drugs. She has been in a monogamous sexual relationship for the past 12 years. Today, vital signs are temperature 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse 88/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 145/95 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses periorbital edema but no jugular venous distention. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination discloses an S1 and S2 without murmurs or gallops. Abdominal examination discloses bulging flanks and shifting dullness to percussion. Examination of the lower extremities shows pitting edema from the mid thigh to the ankles bilaterally. Results of which of the following studies are most likely to be abnormal in this patient? Choices: a) HIV antibody study b) Serum B-type natriuretic peptide concentration c) Toxicology screening of the urine d) Urine protein concentration 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient has swelling of her legs, weight gain, and periorbital edema, which are suggestive of fluid retention. She also has a history of mild anemia and has been taking ibuprofen for Achilles tendinitis.
Next, I need to consider the patient's physical examination findings. The patient has pitting edema from the mid thigh to the ankles bilaterally, which is consistent with fluid retention. The patient also has bulging flanks and shifting dullness to percussion, which are suggestive of ascites.
Now, I need to consider the patient's medical history and physical examination findings to determine which study is most likely to be abnormal. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of heart failure, but the patient's history of mild anemia and use of ibuprofen for Achilles tendinitis makes this less likely. The patient's history of smoking and use of cocaine also increases the risk of kidney disease, which could cause fluid retention. However, the patient's physical examination findings are more suggestive of heart failure than kidney disease.
Therefore, the study that is most likely to be abnormal in this patient is the serum B-type natriuretic peptide concentration, which is a marker of heart failure. {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 31-year-old man with a 5-year history of HIV infection comes to the office because of anal pain, particularly on defecation, for the past 4 months. He says he has seen spots of blood on the toilet tissue but has not had any other noticeable bleeding. He reports no change in bowel habits and has not had recent fever, chills, or rectal drainage. He says he and his partner engage in anal-receptive intercourse. His most recent CD4+ T-lymphocyte count 2 months ago was 350/mm3 ; HIV viral load at that time was undetectable. He currently is being treated with antiretroviral therapy. He has had no opportunistic infections. Medical history is also significant for syphilis and genital herpes treated with penicillin and acyclovir, respectively. He does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcoholic beverages. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows small bilateral inguinal lymph nodes, but respiratory, cardiac, and abdominal examinations disclose no abnormalities. There are several tender fleshy lesions around the perianal area. Rectal examination produces tenderness, but there is no rectal discharge. Test of the stool for occult blood is trace positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time? Choices: a) Acyclovir b) Imiquimod c) Levofloxacin d) Metronidazole 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient has anal pain, particularly on defecation, and has seen spots of blood on the toilet tissue. He also has a history of HIV infection and is currently being treated with antiretroviral therapy. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 350/mm3, and his HIV viral load is undetectable.
The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest that he may have an anal infection, such as anal warts or anal fissures. However, the presence of tender fleshy lesions around the perianal area and rectal examination tenderness suggests a more serious condition.
Considering the patient's HIV status and the presence of anal lesions, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be to treat for an opportunistic infection. However, the patient has not had any opportunistic infections, and his CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is relatively high.
The patient's symptoms and medical history also suggest that he may have a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The patient has a history of syphilis and genital herpes, and he engages in anal-receptive intercourse. Therefore, it is possible that he has an STI that is causing his anal symptoms.
Considering the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be to treat for an STI.

"Input: A 71-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her daughter for evaluation of her mental status. The daughter says, ""I visited Mom today for the first time in 6 months; her memory has worsened, her bills are unpaid, and her house is unusually messy."" The patient says, ""I'm perfectly healthy."" Medical history is significant for hypertension diagnosed more than 25 years ago, and two small strokes occurring 3 years and 7 months ago. The daughter gives you three empty medicine bottles from her mother's home: metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide, and aspirin. The patient is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. Vital signs are temperature 36.4°C (97.6°F), pulse 76/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 196/112 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 93%. Muscle strength in her left hand is 1/5. Strength in the right extremities is 4/5. The patient is oriented only to self; she does not know the day of the week or today's date. She recalls 0 of 3 words at 5 minutes, and she is unable to name 2 objects, correctly draw interlocking pentagons, or count backwards by serial sevens. Complete blood count, renal function studies, liver function studies, and urinalysis are all within the reference ranges. ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms? Choices: a) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis b) Cortical basal ganglionic degeneration c) Neurosyphilis d) Vascular dementia 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's medical history, which includes hypertension and two small strokes occurring 3 years and 7 months ago. This suggests that the patient may have vascular disease.
Next, I need to evaluate the patient's symptoms, which include memory loss, difficulty with daily activities, and muscle weakness. These symptoms are consistent with vascular dementia, which is a type of dementia caused by reduced blood flow to the brain.
The patient's laboratory results, including the complete blood count, renal function studies, liver function studies, and urinalysis, are all within the reference ranges, which suggests that there is no underlying infection or metabolic disorder contributing to the patient's symptoms.
Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms is vascular dementia. {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 17-year-old girl has never had a menstrual period. Physical examination shows a normal female body habitus, normal breast development, and normal appearing external genitalia. She has no axillary or pubic hair. The patient refuses to have a pelvic or rectal examination. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the clinical presentation? Choices: a) Androgen insensitivity b) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia c) Ectodermal dysplasia d) A psychiatric disorder 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's age and the absence of menstrual periods. At 17 years old, the patient is likely in the perimenopausal or postmenopausal stage, but this is unlikely given the normal female body habitus and breast development.
Next, I need to consider the absence of axillary or pubic hair. This suggests a hormonal imbalance, particularly a deficiency in androgens.
Now, I need to consider the patient's refusal to have a pelvic or rectal examination. This suggests that the patient may be avoiding the examination due to anxiety or fear, which could be related to a psychiatric disorder.
Considering the options, I think that a psychiatric disorder is the most likely explanation for the clinical presentation. The patient's refusal to have a pelvic or rectal examination and the absence of axillary or pubic hair suggest a hormonal imbalance, but the patient's normal female body habitus and breast development make androgen insensitivity and congenital adrenal hyperplasia less likely. Ectodermal dysplasia is also unlikely given the normal external genitalia.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 68-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a 3-day history of worsening fever and headache. Today the patient is nauseated and less responsive. Lumbar puncture reveals a protein level of 89 mg/dL (reference range: 15-45 mg/dL) with pleocytosis. The most likely etiologic organism is Choices: a) Clostridium perfringens b) Haemophilus influenzae c) rhinovirus d) Streptococcus pneumoniae 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key information provided in the scenario. The patient is a 68-year-old female with a 3-day history of worsening fever and headache, nausea, and altered mental status. The lumbar puncture results show a high protein level and pleocytosis.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these symptoms and lab results. The high protein level and pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) suggest a bacterial infection, such as meningitis.
Now, I need to evaluate the options provided. Clostridium perfringens is a bacterium that can cause gas gangrene, but it is not typically associated with meningitis. Haemophilus influenzae is a bacterium that can cause meningitis, especially in older adults, but the protein level in the CSF is typically not as high as 89 mg/dL. Rhinovirus is a common cause of upper respiratory infections, but it is not typically associated with meningitis. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of bacterial meningitis, especially in older adults, and the high protein level in the CSF is consistent with this diagnosis.
Therefore, the most likely etiologic organism is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 22-year-old male college student presents to the office with a 6-month history of intermittent loose stools alternating with constipation. He says that he has been constipated for the past 5 days and denies hematochezia and melena. He says that he usually has loose stools during final exam week. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination reveals mild diffuse abdominal tenderness, and the remainder of the findings are normal. Where does the sympathetic innervation for the viscera involved in this patient's condition originate? Choices: a) C1-C2 b) T1-T4 c) T7-L2 d) L3-L5 
Output:
First, I need to identify the viscera involved in this patient's condition. The patient's symptoms of intermittent loose stools and constipation suggest a problem with the large intestine, which is responsible for storing and eliminating waste.
Next, I need to determine the sympathetic innervation for the large intestine. The sympathetic nervous system provides the sympathetic innervation for the viscera, and the preganglionic neurons for the sympathetic nervous system originate from the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord.
The preganglionic neurons for the large intestine originate from the T10-L2 spinal cord segments. Therefore, the sympathetic innervation for the viscera involved in this patient's condition originates from the T10-L2 spinal cord segments, which corresponds to choice c) T7-L2.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: A 33-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of mild nausea, increased urinary urgency and frequency, and constipation. She also has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss during the past 2 weeks and a 3-week history of vaginal bleeding. Pelvic examination shows a nodular cervix with an irregular, friable posterior lip, and a rock-hard, irregular, immobile pelvic mass that extends across the pelvis. Examination of biopsy specimens from the cervix and anterior wall of the vagina show well-differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Which of the following best describes the pathogenesis of this patient's disease? Choices: a) Inactivation of cellular p53 b) Insertion of viral promotors adjacent to cellular growth factor genes c) Specialized transduction d) Transactivation of cellular growth factor genes by TAX 
Output:
First, I need to identify the type of cancer the patient has. The patient has well-differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of cancer that originates from the squamous cells of the cervix.
Next, I need to understand the pathogenesis of this type of cancer. The pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix is often associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.
HPV infection can lead to the insertion of viral promotors adjacent to cellular growth factor genes, which can result in the overexpression of these genes and the promotion of cell growth and proliferation.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: A 52-year-old woman has had dyspnea and hemoptysis for 1 month. She has a history of rheumatic fever as a child and has had a cardiac murmur since early adulthood. Her temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 130/min and irregularly irregular, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 98/60 mm Hg. Jugular venous pressure is not increased. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. There is an opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur at the third left intercostal space. An x-ray of the chest shows left atrial enlargement, a straight left cardiac border, and pulmonary venous engorgement. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings? Choices: a) Aortic valve insufficiency b) Aortic valve stenosis c) Mitral valve insufficiency d) Mitral valve stenosis 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key findings in the case. The patient has a history of rheumatic fever, which is a common cause of valvular heart disease. She has a cardiac murmur, which is a sound heard between the heartbeats, and the murmur is described as an opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur. This type of murmur is characteristic of mitral stenosis.
Next, I need to consider the symptoms and signs of the patient. The patient has dyspnea (shortness of breath) and hemoptysis (coughing up blood), which are symptoms of heart failure. The patient also has a history of rheumatic fever, which is a risk factor for mitral stenosis.
Now, I need to consider the physical examination findings. The patient has bilateral crackles at the lung bases, which are indicative of pulmonary congestion. The patient also has an opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur, which is characteristic of mitral stenosis.
Finally, I need to consider the chest x-ray findings. The patient has left atrial enlargement, a straight left cardiac border, and pulmonary venous engorgement, which are all consistent with mitral stenosis.
Therefore, the most likely explanation for these findings is mitral valve stenosis. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 16-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department by emergency medical technicians because of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure that began 25 minutes ago and has continued despite administration of 0.5 mg/kg rectal diazepam 10 minutes ago. The patient was at home at the time of the seizure. In the emergency department, she is given an additional 0.5 mg/kg dose of diazepam intravenously and the convulsion terminates. Within 2 minutes, her oxygen saturation drops to 75% and she appears cyanotic. Respirations are 10/min and shallow. She receives bag-valve-mask ventilation, followed by intubation and mechanical ventilation. Medical history is unremarkable. She takes no medications. Temperature is 39.1°C (102.5°F). Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's respiratory insufficiency? Choices: a) Airway occlusion b) Encephalitis c) Medication-induced suppression of central respiratory drive d) Meningitis 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key information in the scenario. The patient is a 16-month-old girl who had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure that lasted 25 minutes despite initial treatment with rectal diazepam. She was then given an additional dose of diazepam intravenously, which terminated the seizure. However, shortly after, she developed respiratory insufficiency, characterized by low oxygen saturation, cyanosis, shallow respirations, and the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation.
Next, I need to consider the potential causes of respiratory insufficiency in this scenario. The patient's history of seizure activity and subsequent treatment with diazepam are key factors to consider.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Option a) Airway occlusion is unlikely, as there is no mention of any obstruction in the airway. Option b) Encephalitis is a possibility, but it is not the most likely cause given the patient's age and the acute onset of symptoms. Option c) Medication-induced suppression of central respiratory drive is a plausible explanation, as diazepam is a benzodiazepine that can cause respiratory depression as a side effect. Option d) Meningitis is also a possibility, but it is not the most likely cause given the patient's age and the acute onset of symptoms.
Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's respiratory insufficiency is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 7-year-old male is brought to the office for evaluation of school problems. The mother says that the teacher has told her that the patient is inattentive, has difficulty following sequential instructions, and often seems to drift off to sleep during class. A polysomnogram reveals obstructive sleep apnea. The most appropriate management is Choices: a) elevation of the head of the bed b) heart rate and apnea monitoring c) imipramine d) surgical evaluation 
Output:
First, I need to understand the patient's condition. The patient is a 7-year-old male with obstructive sleep apnea, which is a condition where the patient stops breathing for short periods during sleep due to a blockage in the airway.
Next, I need to consider the management options. Elevation of the head of the bed (option a) is a common treatment for obstructive sleep apnea, as it can help to reduce the severity of the condition by keeping the airway open.
Option b, heart rate and apnea monitoring, is not a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea, but rather a diagnostic tool to monitor the patient's condition.
Option c, imipramine, is a medication that is sometimes used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but it is not a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea.
Option d, surgical evaluation, may be necessary in some cases of obstructive sleep apnea, but it is not the most appropriate initial management.
Therefore, the most appropriate management is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A previously healthy 19-year-old college student comes to student health services 24 hours after the onset of headache, stiff neck, and sensitivity to light. She does not recall any sick contacts. She had chickenpox at the age of 7 years. Her most recent examination 1 year ago included PPD skin testing and showed no abnormalities. She takes a daily multivitamin and an herbal weight-loss preparation. She received all appropriate immunizations during childhood but has not received any since then. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There is no family history of serious illness. She appears lethargic. Her temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 100/68 mm Hg. Examination shows diffuse petechiae. Kernig and Brudzinski signs are present. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A lumbar puncture is performed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows numerous segmented neutrophils and a decreased glucose concentration. A Gram stain of the CSF shows gram-negative cocci. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? Choices: a) Ceftriaxone b) Clindamycin c) Erythromycin d) Metronidazole 
Output:
First, I need to identify the likely cause of the patient's symptoms. The patient presents with headache, stiff neck, sensitivity to light, lethargy, fever, and petechiae, which are classic symptoms of meningitis.
The CSF analysis shows numerous segmented neutrophils and a decreased glucose concentration, which is consistent with bacterial meningitis.
The Gram stain of the CSF shows gram-negative cocci, which is consistent with Neisseria meningitidis, a common cause of bacterial meningitis.
Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is a cephalosporin antibiotic, such as ceftriaxone, which is effective against Neisseria meningitidis.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: A 55-year-old man has had crushing substernal chest pain on exertion over the past 6 weeks. He had a myocardial infarction 2 months ago. He takes nitroglycerin as needed and one aspirin daily. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years. Examination shows normal heart sounds and no carotid or femoral bruits. Treatment with a β-adrenergic blocking agent is most likely to improve his symptoms due to which of the following mechanisms? Choices: a) Decreasing myocardial contractility b) Dilating the coronary arteries c) Peripheral vasodilation d) Preventing fibrin and platelet plugs 
Output:
First, I need to understand the patient's condition. The patient has had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) 2 months ago and is experiencing crushing substernal chest pain on exertion. He also has a history of smoking two packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years, which is a significant risk factor for heart disease.
The patient is taking nitroglycerin as needed, which is a medication that helps to relieve chest pain by dilating blood vessels and reducing blood pressure. He is also taking one aspirin daily, which helps to prevent blood clots.
The patient's symptoms are most likely related to his history of heart attack and smoking. The treatment with a β-adrenergic blocking agent is most likely to improve his symptoms due to its ability to prevent fibrin and platelet plugs, which can cause blood clots and worsen chest pain.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 78-year-old man, who underwent coronary angiography with stent placement 8 years ago, comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination. The patient reports no new symptoms except for shortness of breath and fatigue during exercise that began 3 months ago when he tried to increase the distance of his daily walk from 1 mile to 3 miles. He has not had orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest pain. Additional medical history is significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, and polymyalgia rheumatica. The patient also has a heart murmur that was discovered at an armed forces screening physical examination at age 18 years, but it did not prevent him from serving in the military. Medications are metoprolol, atorvastatin, lisinopril, omeprazole, and a low dose of prednisone every other day. The patient is active and manages a small farm. BMI is 26 kg/m2. Vital signs are temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse 60/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 124/61 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a normal S1, pronounced S2, and a grade 2/6 late systolic murmur heard at the right upper parasternal border. Pulses are normal in contour. Results of laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Choices: a) Decrease the dose of metoprolol b) Increase the dose of prednisone c) Obtain serum vitamin D concentration d) Order a transthoracic echocardiography 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient reports shortness of breath and fatigue during exercise, which began 3 months ago when he increased the distance of his daily walk. This suggests that the patient may have developed exertional dyspnea, which is a common symptom of heart failure.
Next, I need to consider the patient's cardiac examination. The patient has a grade 2/6 late systolic murmur heard at the right upper parasternal border, which suggests that the patient may have aortic stenosis. However, the patient's ECG shows no abnormalities, and the patient's symptoms began 3 months ago, which suggests that the patient's condition may be related to his exercise routine rather than a new cardiac condition.
Now, I need to consider the patient's medications. The patient is taking metoprolol, which is a beta-blocker that can exacerbate heart failure. However, the patient's symptoms began 3 months ago, and the patient's cardiac examination is normal, which suggests that the patient's condition may not be related to his medication.
Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to order a transthoracic echocardiography to evaluate the patient's cardiac function and rule out any underlying cardiac conditions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 70-year-old woman comes to the office because of worsening tremor of her hands. The tremor has been present for most of her life and initially was mild and would occur only when she was tired or stressed. During the past month the shaking has become more noticeable and frequent. She is now embarrassed to eat with other people because of how obvious the tremor has become. The patient has been taking fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks to help her to cope with the death of her husband 2 months ago. Medical history is also remarkable for essential hypertension controlled with lisinopril and hyperlipidemia controlled with atorvastatin. Her only other medication is occasional ibuprofen for joint pain. She used to drink one to two alcoholic beverages monthly but now drinks one glass of wine daily because, she says, it reduces her tremor. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (155 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2. Vital signs are temperature 36.4°C (97.6°F), pulse 80/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a moderate tremor of both hands that is not present at rest. Complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and serum thyroid function tests are ordered and results are pending. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's worsening tremor? Choices: a) Adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy b) Bereavement reaction c) Early Parkinson disease d) Increase in alcohol consumption 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's history and symptoms. The patient has a long-standing tremor that has worsened over the past month, and she is now embarrassed by it. She has been taking fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks, but this is unlikely to be the cause of the worsening tremor, as fluoxetine is not typically associated with tremors.
Next, I need to consider the patient's bereavement reaction. The patient's husband passed away 2 months ago, and she has been taking fluoxetine to cope with her grief. However, a bereavement reaction is unlikely to cause a worsening tremor.
Now, I need to consider the patient's alcohol consumption. The patient used to drink one to two alcoholic beverages monthly but now drinks one glass of wine daily. This increase in alcohol consumption is likely to be the cause of the worsening tremor, as alcohol can exacerbate tremors in some individuals.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: An 18-year-old female presents to the office with a 3-day history of lower abdominal pain and a 2-day history of fever. She reports frequent unprotected sexual intercourse with different partners since she started college 4 months ago. Abdominal examination reveals suprapubic tenderness. Bimanual examination of the uterus reveals more intense tenderness. Swabs of cervical mucus are obtained. This patient should be given antimicrobial chemotherapy to provide treatment for Choices: a) Candida albicans\xa0and\xa0Chlamydia trachomatis b) Chlamydia trachomatis\xa0and\xa0Neisseria gonorrhoeae c) Chlamydia trachomatis\xa0and\xa0Treponema pallidum d) Gardnerella vaginalis\xa0and\xa0Mobiluncus\xa0species 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and risk factors. The patient is a young woman with a history of unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners, which increases her risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
The patient presents with lower abdominal pain, fever, and suprapubic tenderness, which are common symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a condition caused by STIs.
The patient's symptoms and risk factors suggest that she may have PID, which is typically caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
Therefore, the patient should be given antimicrobial chemotherapy to treat Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

"Input: A 76-year-old man comes to the office because of early awakening at night. He has no difficulty falling asleep but routinely wakes up between 2:00 and 3:00 AM. The patient is a retired postal worker, and he has always been physically active. He has diabetes mellitus controlled by diet. The patient drinks one cup of coffee in the morning with breakfast and usually walks for exercise in the morning. Before retiring at night he has one alcoholic beverage. He has no history of depression, nightmares, or snoring and he takes no over-the-counter medications. His wife of 45 years is also in good health. Vital signs are temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse 96/min and regular, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 135/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a well-nourished, well-developed man. He is not obese. Examination of the head and neck is normal; there are no bruits or jugular venous distention. Chest is clear, and heart is normal with S1 and S2. Abdomen is soft and nontender with active bowel sounds and no organomegaly. Rectal examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient's insomnia? Choices: a) Advise the patient to discontinue his bedtime drink of alcohol b) Advise the patient to read and snack in bed to relax c) Prescribe a vigorous pre-bedtime exercise regimen d) Prescribe sertraline 
Output:
First, I need to identify the underlying cause of the patient's insomnia. The patient wakes up between 2:00 and 3:00 AM, which suggests that he may be experiencing a phase delay in his sleep-wake cycle.
Next, I need to consider the patient's lifestyle habits. The patient drinks one alcoholic beverage before retiring at night, which can disrupt sleep patterns and lead to early awakening.
Now, I need to consider the patient's medical history and physical examination. The patient has diabetes mellitus controlled by diet, and his vital signs and physical examination are normal. There is no indication of depression, nightmares, or snoring.
Based on the above considerations, the most appropriate management of the patient's insomnia is to advise him to discontinue his bedtime drink of alcohol. This is because alcohol can disrupt sleep patterns and lead to early awakening, and discontinuing it may help the patient to sleep more soundly and wake up later in the morning.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: A 15-year-old girl is brought to the physician 3 months after she had a blood pressure of 150/95 mm Hg at a routine examination prior to participation in school sports. She is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness. Twelve months ago, she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She currently takes no medications. Subsequent blood pressure measurements on three separate occasions since the last visit have been: 155/94 mm Hg, 145/90 mm Hg, and 150/92 mm Hg. She is at the 50th percentile for height and 95th percentile for weight. Her blood pressure today is 150/90 mm Hg confirmed by a second measurement, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Her hematocrit is 40%. Urinalysis is within normal limits. Cardiac and renal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Choices: a) Exercise and weight reduction program b) Measurement of urine catecholamine concentrations c) Measurement of urine corticosteroid concentrations d) Captopril therapy 
Output:
First, I need to determine if the girl's blood pressure is elevated. The girl's blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg, which is higher than the normal range for her age.
Next, I need to consider the girl's age and the fact that she is asymptomatic. The girl is 15 years old, and her blood pressure is only slightly elevated.
Now, I need to consider the girl's weight and the fact that she is at the 95th percentile for weight. The girl's weight is a potential contributing factor to her elevated blood pressure.
Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to recommend an exercise and weight reduction program to help the girl manage her weight and potentially lower her blood pressure.

"Input: A previously healthy 14-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 2-day history of fever and pain and swelling of the right knee. She remembers injuring the knee while playing soccer last week, but she was able to finish the game. She has no history of rash or joint pain. Her sister has inflammatory bowel disease. The patient's temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. Examination of the right knee shows swelling, tenderness, warmth, and erythema; range of motion is limited. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Choices: a) Nuclear scan of the right knee b) MRI of the right knee c) Antibiotic therapy d) Arthrocentesis 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and history. The patient has a fever and pain and swelling of the right knee, which suggests an inflammatory process.
Next, I need to consider the patient's age and the fact that she has no history of joint pain or rash, which makes a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis or lupus less likely.
The patient's sister has inflammatory bowel disease, which may suggest a genetic predisposition to inflammatory conditions, but this does not directly influence the next step in management.
The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible diagnosis of septic arthritis, which is a medical emergency.
Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform arthrocentesis to obtain a joint fluid sample for analysis, which will help to confirm or rule out septic arthritis.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 2-day history of a sore throat and fever that peaks in the late afternoon. He also has a 1-week history of progressive fatigue. He recently began having unprotected sexual intercourse with one partner. He appears ill. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Physical examination shows cervical lymphadenopathy and pharyngeal erythema with a creamy exudate. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Choices: a) Candidiasis b) Herpangina c) Infectious mononucleosis d) Mumps 
Output:
First, I need to consider the symptoms presented by the patient. The patient has a sore throat, fever, and cervical lymphadenopathy, which are common symptoms of several infections.
Next, I need to consider the patient's recent history of unprotected sexual intercourse. This increases the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
The patient's symptoms, particularly the sore throat and fever, are consistent with an STI. Among the options, infectious mononucleosis is a common STI that presents with sore throat, fever, and lymphadenopathy.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: A 1-year-old male is brought to the emergency department with blistered fresh burns over his hands and feet in a stocking and glove distribution. His mother reports that he was accidentally burned when he turned on the hot water in the bathtub while she was answering the telephone in the bedroom. In addition to debridement of the burns, pain management, a thorough history and physical examination, and baseline laboratory studies, the most appropriate next step is to Choices: a) administer a 5% albumin infusion b) administer intravenous steroids c) contact child protective services d) discharge the patient home with his parents 
Output:
First, I need to consider the mechanism of injury. The child was burned when he turned on the hot water in the bathtub, which suggests that the burn was caused by a scald.
Next, I need to consider the distribution of the burns. The burns are in a stocking and glove distribution, which suggests that the child was in a position where he was able to reach the faucet and turn it on, but not in a position where he could have reached the water itself.
Now, I need to consider the age of the child. The child is 1 year old, which means that he is still in a stage of development where he is learning about his environment and may not have the cognitive ability to understand the dangers of hot water.
Considering all of these factors, the most appropriate next step is to contact child protective services, as the burn may have been preventable and the child may be at risk for further harm.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 42-year-old man comes to the physician because of malaise, muscle and joint pain, and temperatures to 38.4°C (101.1°F) for 3 days. Three months ago, he underwent cadaveric renal transplantation resulting in immediate kidney function. At the time of discharge, his serum creatinine concentration was 0.8 mg/dL. He is receiving cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Examination shows no abnormalities. His leukocyte count is 2700/mm3, and serum creatinine concentration is 1.6 mg/dL; serum cyclosporine concentration is in the therapeutic range. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows intracellular inclusion bodies. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Choices: a) Increase the dosage of corticosteroids b) Increase the dosage of cyclosporine c) Begin amphotericin therapy d) Begin ganciclovir therapy 
Output:
First, I need to identify the cause of the patient's symptoms. The patient has a history of kidney transplantation and is currently taking immunosuppressive medications, which can increase the risk of infections. The patient's symptoms, such as malaise, muscle and joint pain, and fever, are suggestive of an infection.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of the infection. The patient's biopsy shows intracellular inclusion bodies, which is suggestive of a viral infection. The patient's symptoms and the biopsy results are consistent with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, which is a common complication in transplant patients.
Now, I need to determine the appropriate treatment for the patient. The patient is already receiving immunosuppressive medications, which can increase the risk of CMV infection. The most appropriate next step in management is to begin antiviral therapy to treat the CMV infection.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: During a clinical study examining the effects of exercise, men between the ages of 20 and 30 years are evaluated during a 15- minute session on a treadmill. The average pulse for the last 2 minutes of the session is 175/min. During the last minute of exercise, various measurements are taken. Compared with the measurement before the session, which of the following is most likely to be decreased? Choices: a) Pulse pressure b) Stroke volume c) Systolic blood pressure d) Total peripheral resistance 
Output:
First, I need to understand the context of the problem. The clinical study is examining the effects of exercise on men between the ages of 20 and 30 years.
Next, I need to identify the key information provided: the average pulse for the last 2 minutes of the session is 175/min.
Now, I need to analyze the options and determine which one is most likely to be decreased. 
Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Exercise typically increases heart rate and blood pressure, so pulse pressure is likely to increase, not decrease.
Stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped by the heart per beat. Exercise typically increases stroke volume, so it is unlikely to be decreased.
Systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats. Exercise typically increases systolic blood pressure, so it is unlikely to be decreased.
Total peripheral resistance is the resistance to blood flow in the arteries. Exercise typically decreases total peripheral resistance, so it is the most likely option to be decreased.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 22-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after he sustained a gunshot wound to the abdomen. His pulse is 120/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg. Breath sounds are normal on the right and decreased on the left. Abdominal examination shows an entrance wound in the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line below the left costal margin. There is an exit wound laterally in the left axillary line at the 4th rib. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Choices: a) CT scan of the chest b) Intubation and mechanical ventilation c) Peritoneal lavage d) Left tube thoracostomy 
Output:
First, I need to assess the patient's condition. The patient has a gunshot wound to the abdomen, which is a life-threatening injury. The patient's vital signs are abnormal, with a high pulse and respirations, and low blood pressure, indicating shock.
Next, I need to determine the extent of the injury. The patient has an entrance wound in the left upper quadrant and an exit wound in the left axillary line, which suggests that the bullet has traversed the left thoracic cavity.
Given the patient's condition and the extent of the injury, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform a left tube thoracostomy to drain the left thoracic cavity and relieve any tension pneumothorax.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 31-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, who is at 32 weeks' gestation, is admitted to the hospital because of a 1-week history of progressive dyspnea and wheezing. She says her heart is ""racing"" and she is coughing up a small amount of bloodstreaked sputum. Medical history is significant for hypothyroidism, for which she takes levothyroxine. An intravenous catheter is placed. Vital signs are temperature 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse 132/min, respirations 32/min, and blood pressure 135/78 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on 100% oxygen via nasal cannula shows an oxygen saturation of 92%. Auscultation of the lungs discloses decreased breath sounds at the bases with expiratory crackles bilaterally. Cardiac examination discloses an irregularly irregular rhythm, an indistinct point of maximal impulse, and a loud S1. A grade 3/6, low-pitched, diastolic, rumbling murmur is audible at the apex; a distinct snapping sound precedes the murmur. Fetal heart rate is 144/min. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the findings in this patient? Choices: a) Chronic mitral regurgitation secondary to rheumatic heart disease b) Coarctation of the aorta c) Congenital aortic stenosis d) Mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key findings in the patient's presentation. The patient is a 31-year-old woman at 32 weeks' gestation, presenting with progressive dyspnea, wheezing, and coughing up bloodstreaked sputum. Her vital signs show tachycardia, tachypnea, and decreased oxygen saturation despite being on 100% oxygen. The physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the bases with expiratory crackles bilaterally, an irregularly irregular rhythm, an indistinct point of maximal impulse, and a loud S1. A grade 3/6, low-pitched, diastolic, rumbling murmur is audible at the apex, preceded by a distinct snapping sound.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these findings. The patient's presentation is suggestive of heart failure, with signs of pulmonary congestion (decreased breath sounds at the bases with expiratory crackles) and cardiac dysfunction (irregularly irregular rhythm, indistinct point of maximal impulse, and loud S1). The murmur at the apex, preceded by a snapping sound, is characteristic of mitral stenosis.
Finally, the patient's history of hypothyroidism and the presence of atrial fibrillation suggest that the mitral stenosis is complicated by atrial fibrillation. Therefore, the most likely cause of the findings in this patient is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 47-year-old man comes to the physician 12 hours after the sudden onset of a severe occipital headache and stiff neck. He has not had any other symptoms and has no history of severe headache. He has hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide and ranitidine. He is oriented to person, place, and time. His temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg. Range of motion of the neck is decreased due to pain. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Choices: a) Cluster headache b) Meningitis c) Migraine d) Subarachnoid hemorrhage 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms. The patient has a severe occipital headache and stiff neck, which are concerning for a neurological condition.
Next, I need to consider the patient's history and physical examination. The patient has hypertension, which is a risk factor for subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which is consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient's neck range of motion is decreased due to pain, which is consistent with meningismus, a sign of meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Now, I need to consider the patient's age and the sudden onset of symptoms. The patient is 47 years old, which is an age where subarachnoid hemorrhage is more likely. The sudden onset of symptoms is also consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 10-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because her school nurse thinks that she may have Marfan syndrome. She is at the 95th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows a narrow palate with dental crowding, long slender extremities, and joint laxity. Molecular testing for FBN1 shows a single nucleotide difference that does not change the amino acid at that locus. Her mother is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall. There is no clinical evidence of Marfan syndrome in the mother, but she has the same single nucleotide change as the patient. The same nucleotide change is found in 15 of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome. Which of the following best describes the single nucleotide change in the patient and her mother? Choices: a) It is a disease-causing mutation in the patient and her mother b) It is a polymorphism c) It is a sequence variant of unknown significance d) It will change the folding of the protein 
Output:
First, I need to understand the information given. The patient has a single nucleotide difference in the FBN1 gene, but this difference does not change the amino acid at that locus. This means that the difference is a silent mutation.
Next, I need to consider the fact that the mother has the same single nucleotide change as the patient, but she does not have Marfan syndrome. This suggests that the change is not disease-causing.
Now, I need to consider the fact that the same nucleotide change is found in 15 of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome. This suggests that the change is a common variation in the population, rather than a disease-causing mutation.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 50-year-old woman comes to the office for the first time because of recurrent abdominal pain. Review of her extensive medical chart, which she has brought with her, discloses that she has a long history of varying physical symptoms. Definitive causes for these symptoms have not been found despite extensive diagnostic studies, consultations with many physicians, and several surgical explorations. She gives dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her present and past symptoms, and she makes conflicting statements about her history. She has been hospitalized at least 23 times since age 18 years. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Choices: a) Conversion disorder b) Histrionic personality disorder c) Occult medical disorder d) Somatic symptom disorder 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and history. She has a long history of varying physical symptoms, but no definitive causes have been found despite extensive diagnostic studies and consultations with many physicians.
Next, I need to consider the patient's behavior and presentation. She gives dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her symptoms, and she makes conflicting statements about her history.
Now, I need to consider the possible diagnoses. Conversion disorder is a condition in which a person experiences neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by a medical condition, but it does not typically involve a long history of multiple hospitalizations. Histrionic personality disorder is a condition characterized by excessive emotionality and attention-seeking behavior, but it is not typically associated with physical symptoms. Occult medical disorder is a condition in which a person has a medical condition that has not been diagnosed, but it is not typically associated with a long history of multiple hospitalizations and conflicting statements about the history.
The most likely diagnosis is somatic symptom disorder, which is a condition in which a person experiences one or more chronic physical symptoms that are distressing and result in significant disruption of daily life. The patient's long history of multiple hospitalizations and conflicting statements about her history are consistent with this diagnosis.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 5-year-old boy returns to the office with his 19-year-old mother to discuss results of studies done to evaluate his behavior of eating dirt. The patient sits quietly while his mother answers questions about his health. She says her son seems healthy, although he does not seem to be as active as other children his age. He has said his head hurts three or four times during the past 2 weeks. He has not had fever, sweats, or chills. She says he has a good appetite but has had a habit of eating sand and dirt since age 3 years. She says, ""I don't know where he gets that habit. I used to eat dirt, but I stopped years ago. I try to stop him from eating dirt, but I'm not around much since I work two jobs."" The patient takes no medications. Vaccinations are upto-date. Height, weight, and BMI are at the 50th percentile. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities except for symmetrical nontender cervical adenopathy. Results of laboratory studies, including serum zinc, lead, and iron concentrations, are within the reference ranges. Serologic testing confirms toxoplasmosis. In addition to prescribing pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Choices: a) Prescribe fluoxetine b) Prescribe methylphenidate c) Prescribe risperidone d) Refer the patient to a child psychiatrist 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's symptoms and the potential underlying causes. The patient is a 5-year-old boy who has been eating dirt for the past 2 years, and his mother reports that he has a habit of eating sand and dirt since age 3 years. He has also had headaches and is less active than other children his age.
Next, I need to consider the potential underlying causes of the patient's symptoms. The patient's mother reports that she used to eat dirt, but stopped years ago, and the patient's vaccinations are up-to-date. The patient's laboratory studies, including serum zinc, lead, and iron concentrations, are within the reference ranges. However, the patient has symmetrical nontender cervical adenopathy, which is a common finding in children with toxoplasmosis.
Now, I need to consider the potential treatment options for the patient's symptoms. The patient has been diagnosed with toxoplasmosis, and the most appropriate next step in management is to prescribe pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine therapy. In addition to this, the patient's symptoms of eating dirt and decreased activity level may be indicative of a psychiatric disorder, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to refer the patient to a child psychiatrist for further evaluation and treatment.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 32-year-old man and his 29-year-old wife come to the office for evaluation for infertility. The wife's gynecologist has reported that her anatomic and physiologic evaluation disclosed no abnormalities and that assessment of potential male factors is needed. The husband is 188 cm (6 ft 3 in) tall with fair skin and little facial hair. He has mild gynecomastia and small, firm testicles. No sperm are seen on semen analysis. Which of the following tests is most likely to establish the underlying cause of this couple's infertility? Choices: a) Karyotype from peripheral leukocytes b) Serum estrogen and testosterone concentrations c) Serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations d) Serum prolactin concentration 
Output:
First, I need to consider the symptoms presented by the husband. He has mild gynecomastia and small, firm testicles, which are indicative of hormonal imbalances.
Next, I need to consider the fact that no sperm are seen on semen analysis, which suggests a problem with sperm production or function.
Given these symptoms, the most likely underlying cause of the couple's infertility is a hormonal imbalance, specifically an imbalance between estrogen and testosterone.
To establish the underlying cause, I need to measure the levels of these hormones in the husband's blood.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 28-year-old man comes to the office because he would like to quit smoking cigarettes. He says, ""I cannot go more than a day without cigarettes because I get so anxious and irritable. I even wake up at night to smoke."" The patient began smoking cigarettes at age 12 years; he was smoking two packs of cigarettes daily by age 17 years, and he has not curtailed his use since that time. He does not drink alcoholic beverages or use illicit drugs. Medical history is remarkable for childhood febrile seizures. He takes no medications. Vital signs are normal. The patient is interested in using a nicotine patch and bupropion therapy because he says his friend found the treatments to be helpful. In combining these two therapies, this patient is at greatest risk for which of the following? Choices: a) Hypertension b) Polyuria c) Renal insufficiency d) The patient is at no increased risk 
Output:
First, I need to identify the potential side effects of each medication. The patient is interested in using a nicotine patch and bupropion therapy.
The nicotine patch can cause skin irritation, but it is not a significant concern in this case.
Bupropion therapy can cause seizures, and the patient has a history of childhood febrile seizures. This is a significant concern because the patient may be at increased risk for seizures when taking bupropion.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 40-year-old male presents to the office with symptoms of odynophagia and gastroesophageal reflux. He also says that he experienced hematemesis once last week. Past medical history reveals AIDS, and his most recent CD4 count was 30 cells/mcL. The patient's tilt test result and hemoglobin level are normal. Rectal examination demonstrates brown stool that is positive for occult blood. What is the most appropriate initial step in this patient's management? Choices: a) prescription for a proton pump inhibitor and a prokinetic agent b) prescription for an H2-blocker trial for 6 weeks c) prescription for clotrimazole troches d) referral for an upper endoscopy with biopsy 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient presents with odynophagia, gastroesophageal reflux, and hematemesis, which suggests an esophageal or gastric issue.
The patient's past medical history reveals AIDS, with a CD4 count of 30 cells/mcL, indicating a compromised immune system. This makes him more susceptible to opportunistic infections.
The patient's tilt test result and hemoglobin level are normal, which helps to rule out some potential causes of his symptoms.
The rectal examination reveals brown stool positive for occult blood, which suggests that the bleeding is likely coming from the upper GI tract.
Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely cause of his symptoms is an opportunistic infection, such as esophageal candidiasis.
The most appropriate initial step in this patient's management would be to prescribe clotrimazole troches, which are an antifungal medication that can treat esophageal candidiasis.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 55-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine physical examination. He is currently taking no medications. His pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 165/95 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no other abnormalities. The presence of which of the following mechanisms is most likely to increase this patient's blood pressure further? Choices: a) Decreased cardiac output b) Decreased pulse c) Decreased stroke volume d) Increased peripheral vascular resistance 
Output:
First, I need to understand the patient's current blood pressure reading, which is 165/95 mm Hg. This indicates that the systolic pressure is 165 mm Hg and the diastolic pressure is 95 mm Hg.
Next, I need to consider the mechanisms that could increase blood pressure further. Decreased cardiac output (choice a) would actually decrease blood pressure, not increase it. Decreased pulse (choice b) would also decrease blood pressure, as a lower heart rate would result in less blood being pumped through the body. Decreased stroke volume (choice c) would also decrease blood pressure, as a lower volume of blood being pumped with each heartbeat would result in less blood being circulated.
Increased peripheral vascular resistance (choice d) would increase blood pressure, as the blood vessels would constrict and make it more difficult for blood to flow through them, increasing the pressure inside the vessels.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 54-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination 10 days after undergoing a stereotactic brain operation to remove a small tumor. The operation was successful. During the procedure, he was under conscious sedation. The patient recalls that at one point during the operation he experienced a sudden, intense feeling of overwhelming fear. Which of the following areas of the brain was most likely stimulated at that time? Choices: a) Amygdala b) Hippocampus c) Mammillary body d) Prefrontal cortex 
Output:
First, I need to understand the symptoms described by the patient. The patient experienced a sudden, intense feeling of overwhelming fear during the operation.
Next, I need to consider the functions of the brain areas listed in the choices. The amygdala is responsible for processing emotions, such as fear and anxiety.
The hippocampus is involved in memory formation and spatial navigation.
The mammillary body is part of the limbic system and plays a role in memory and emotion.
The prefrontal cortex is involved in decision-making, planning, and impulse control.
Considering the symptoms and the functions of the brain areas, the amygdala is the most likely area to be stimulated, as it is responsible for processing emotions such as fear.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 2-day history of fever and painful swelling of the left ankle. He has had recurrent cervical lymphadenitis and pneumonia since infancy. Two years ago, a culture from an abscess in the cervical region grew Staphylococcus aureus. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F). Examination shows a tender, erythematous, edematous left ankle; there is point tenderness over the medial malleolus. A bone scan shows increased uptake in the left lower tibial metaphysis. Culture of bone aspirate grows Serratia marcescens. Nitroblue tetrazolium test shows no color change. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism for these findings? Choices: a) Developmental arrest of maturation of B lymphocytes b) Dysmorphogenesis of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches c) Impaired chemotaxis d) Impaired phagocytic oxidative metabolism 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key findings in this case. The boy has a history of recurrent infections, including cervical lymphadenitis and pneumonia, and a recent episode of osteomyelitis (infection of the bone) caused by Serratia marcescens. The bone scan shows increased uptake in the left lower tibial metaphysis, indicating inflammation. The culture of bone aspirate grows Serratia marcescens, which is a gram-negative rod. The Nitroblue tetrazolium test shows no color change, which suggests impaired phagocytic oxidative metabolism.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these findings. The boy's recurrent infections and impaired phagocytic oxidative metabolism suggest a problem with his immune system. The Nitroblue tetrazolium test is used to diagnose chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a condition in which phagocytic cells are unable to produce superoxides, leading to impaired killing of certain bacteria.
Finally, I need to consider the possible mechanisms for these findings. The impaired phagocytic oxidative metabolism is consistent with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which is caused by a defect in the NADPH oxidase system. This system is responsible for producing superoxides, which are necessary for killing certain bacteria. Therefore, the most likely mechanism for these findings is impaired phagocytic oxidative metabolism.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A placebo-controlled clinical trial is conducted to assess whether a new antihypertensive drug is more effective than standard therapy. A total of 5000 patients with essential hypertension are enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two groups: 2500 patients receive the new drug and 2500 patients receive placebo. If the alpha is set at 0.01 instead of 0.05, which of the following is the most likely result? Choices: a) Significant findings can be reported with greater confidence b) The study will have more power c) There is a decreased likelihood of a Type II error d) There is an increased likelihood of statistically significant findings 
Output:
First, I need to understand the relationship between alpha and the likelihood of statistically significant findings. A lower alpha level (e.g., 0.01) means that the results need to be more extreme to be considered statistically significant.
Next, I need to consider the relationship between alpha and the likelihood of a Type II error. A lower alpha level actually increases the likelihood of a Type II error, because it makes it harder to reject the null hypothesis.
Now, I need to consider the relationship between alpha and the power of the study. A lower alpha level actually decreases the power of the study, because it makes it harder to detect statistically significant effects.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 6-day history of fever, severe muscle pain, and diffuse, painful swelling of his neck, underarms, and groin area. The symptoms began after returning from a camping trip in New Mexico. He appears ill and lethargic and can barely answer questions. His temperature is 39.2°C (102.5°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows generalized scattered black maculae. Examination of the right upper extremity shows an erythematous, solid, tender mass on the underside of the upper extremity just above the elbow; the mass is draining blood and necrotic material. The most effective antibiotic for this patient’s disorder will interfere with which of the following cellular processes or enzymes? Choices: a) DNA helicase b) Glucuronosyltransferase c) Proteasomal degradation d) Ribosomal assembly 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's disorder. The symptoms described, such as fever, muscle pain, and diffuse, painful swelling of the neck, underarms, and groin area, are consistent with Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), a tick-borne disease caused by Rickettsia rickettsii.
The patient's physical examination findings, including the black maculae and the erythematous, solid, tender mass on the underside of the upper extremity, are also consistent with RMSF.
The most effective antibiotic for RMSF is doxycycline.
Doxycycline works by inhibiting protein synthesis, which is a process that occurs during ribosomal assembly.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 26-year-old woman with HIV infection comes to the office because of a 4-day history of pain and redness of her left lower leg. She says the symptoms began after she tripped over a tree branch in her yard and scraped her left leg. Current medications include antiretroviral therapy and ibuprofen as needed. Vital signs are temperature 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse 86/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 138/70 mm Hg. There is a 5×8-cm area on the anterior surface of her left lower extremity that is swollen, erythematous, and tender. She previously has developed a rash after taking erythromycin, and she has had an anaphylactic response to penicillin. Which of the following antibiotic therapies is most appropriate for this patient? Choices: a) Amoxicillin b) Ciprofloxacin c) Clarithromycin d) Clindamycin 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's history of anaphylactic response to penicillin, which means she is allergic to penicillin and its derivatives. This limits the options for antibiotic therapy.
Next, I need to consider the patient's current symptoms, which include pain, redness, and swelling of her left lower leg, suggesting a possible skin infection.
The patient is also taking antiretroviral therapy, which may increase the risk of certain infections, but it does not directly affect the choice of antibiotic.
Given the patient's allergy to penicillin and the need for an antibiotic, I would consider the options:
- Amoxicillin is a penicillin derivative and is not suitable due to the patient's allergy.
- Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including those that cause skin infections.
- Clarithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic, which is a different class from penicillin, but it is not the best option given the patient's previous rash after taking erythromycin, a similar macrolide.
- Clindamycin is a lincosamide antibiotic that is effective against certain types of skin infections, but it is not the best option given the patient's current symptoms and the need for a broader-spectrum antibiotic.
Therefore, the most appropriate antibiotic therapy for this patient is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because of two 12-hour episodes of dizziness over the past 3 months. During episodes, she experiences the acute onset of rotatory vertigo and imbalance, decreased hearing, tinnitus, a sense of fullness of the right ear, and vomiting. Examination shows a mild hearing loss of the right ear. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Choices: a) Acoustic neuroma b) Benign positional vertigo c) Brain stem transient ischemic attacks d) Meniere's disease 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key symptoms presented in the case. The patient experiences episodes of dizziness, rotatory vertigo, imbalance, decreased hearing, tinnitus, a sense of fullness of the right ear, and vomiting.
Next, I need to consider the duration and frequency of the episodes. The episodes last for 12 hours and occur over a period of 3 months.
Now, I need to evaluate the symptoms in relation to the possible diagnoses. Acoustic neuroma is a type of tumor that affects the nerve responsible for hearing and balance, but it typically presents with unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, but not necessarily with episodes of vertigo. Benign positional vertigo is a condition that causes brief episodes of vertigo triggered by head movement, but it does not typically cause hearing loss or tinnitus. Brain stem transient ischemic attacks are episodes of temporary brain dysfunction caused by a lack of blood flow, but they do not typically cause hearing loss or tinnitus. Meniere's disease is a disorder of the inner ear that causes episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, and a sense of fullness in the ear, which matches the patient's symptoms.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 22-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 5-day history of sore throat and fever. During the past 3 days, she also has noticed a change in her voice and has had increased pain with swallowing. She has been taking acetaminophen since her symptoms began. Medical history is unremarkable and she takes no routine medications. Vital signs are temperature 40.0°C (104.0°F), pulse 130/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 102/66 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Examination of the oropharynx shows erythema, edema, and anterior displacement of the right side of the soft palate. The uvula is deviated to the left. There is a white exudate on the right tonsil. Trismus is noted. Palpation of the neck discloses enlarged, tender, mobile anterior cervical lymph nodes. In addition to antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate management? Choices: a) Incision and drainage b) Intravenous methylprednisolone therapy c) Oral nystatin therapy d) Salt water gargle 
Output:
First, I need to identify the likely diagnosis. The patient's symptoms, such as sore throat, fever, change in voice, and increased pain with swallowing, suggest a possible case of tonsillitis.
Next, I need to consider the severity of the patient's symptoms. The patient has a high fever, tachycardia, and trismus, which indicate a severe case of tonsillitis.
Now, I need to consider the appropriate management. For a severe case of tonsillitis, the most appropriate management is antibiotic therapy. However, the patient also has a white exudate on the right tonsil, which may indicate a peritonsillar abscess. In this case, the most appropriate management is incision and drainage of the abscess.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."
"Input: A 45-year-old female presents to the office for evaluation of unexplained elevations of her blood pressure. Paroxysmal episodes of headache, sweating, anxiety, nausea, and vomiting occur frequently. A CT scan reveals a left adrenal mass. Which of the following urinary assays will be most helpful in establishing this patient's diagnosis? Choices: a) cortisol b) glucose c) sodium d) vanillylmandelic acid 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms and the CT scan results. The patient has episodes of headache, sweating, anxiety, nausea, and vomiting, and a left adrenal mass is found on the CT scan.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these symptoms and the CT scan results. The symptoms suggest an excess of catecholamines, which are hormones produced by the adrenal glands.
Now, I need to consider the options. Cortisol (a) is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, but it is not directly related to the symptoms described. Glucose (b) is not directly related to the symptoms or the CT scan results. Sodium (c) is also not directly related to the symptoms or the CT scan results. Vanillylmandelic acid (d) is a metabolite of catecholamines, and an excess of catecholamines would lead to an increase in vanillylmandelic acid in the urine.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 40 minutes after he was involved in a motor vehicle collision. He was the unrestrained driver. He is conscious. Physical examination shows numerous lacerations and ecchymoses over the face. His vision is normal. Ocular, facial, and lingual movements are intact. The gag reflex is present. Sensation to pinprick is absent over the right side of the face anterior to the right ear, extending down along the full extent of the mandible to the chin. Sensation also is absent over the right side of the tongue. X-rays of the skull show fractures of the orbit, zygomatic arch, and infratemporal fossa. The most likely cause of these findings is a fracture affecting which of the following locations? Choices: a) Foramen lacerum b) Foramen ovale c) Foramen rotundum d) Foramen spinosum 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms presented in the case. The patient has numerous lacerations and ecchymoses over the face, but his vision is normal. He also has absent sensation to pinprick over the right side of the face, extending down along the full extent of the mandible to the chin, and absent sensation over the right side of the tongue. These symptoms suggest a lesion affecting the trigeminal nerve, which is responsible for facial sensation.
Next, I need to consider the possible locations of the fracture that could cause these symptoms. The trigeminal nerve exits the skull through the foramen ovale, which is located in the infratemporal fossa. A fracture in this area could damage the nerve and cause the symptoms described.
Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings is a fracture affecting the foramen ovale. {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 3-week-old male infant is brought to the office by his mother because of a 2-day history of white lesions in the mouth. The infant was born at term via uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery; he has been breast-feeding well and is urinating and having bowel movements normally. At birth, he weighed 3289 g (7 lb 4 oz; 30th percentile). Today, he weighs 3629 kg (8 lb; 25th percentile). He appears adequately hydrated. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa that do not come off when gently scraped with a tongue blade. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? Choices: a) Acyclovir b) Fluconazole c) Nystatin d) Valacyclovir 
Output:
First, I need to identify the condition described in the scenario. The white lesions in the mouth that do not come off when scraped with a tongue blade are characteristic of thrush, a fungal infection caused by Candida species.

Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: A 45-year-old man comes to the physician because of right shoulder pain that began after he chopped wood 2 days ago. Examination of the right upper extremity shows no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness. The pain is reproduced when the patient is asked to externally rotate the shoulder against resistance; there is no weakness. In addition to the teres minor, inflammation of which of the following tendons is most likely in this patient? Choices: a) Infraspinatus b) Pectoralis c) Subscapularis d) Supraspinatus 
Output:
First, I need to identify the muscle that is responsible for the action of externally rotating the shoulder. The muscle responsible for this action is the infraspinatus.
Next, I need to consider the symptoms described in the case. The patient has pain that is reproduced when externally rotating the shoulder against resistance, but there is no weakness. This suggests that the tendon of the infraspinatus muscle is inflamed.
Now, I need to consider the other options. The pectoralis muscle is involved in adduction and medial rotation of the shoulder, not external rotation. The subscapularis muscle is involved in medial rotation and adduction of the shoulder, not external rotation. The supraspinatus muscle is involved in abduction of the shoulder, not external rotation.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician because of easy bruising for 4 months. She has a history of lung cancer treated with radiation therapy 6 months ago. She has a 2-year history of hypertension treated with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no abnormalities except for multiple ecchymoses. Her hemoglobin concentration is 13 g/dL, leukocyte count is 5000/mm3, and platelet count is 35,000/mm3. A serum antiplatelet antibody assay is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis? Choices: a) CT scan of the abdomen b) CT scan of the chest c) Bronchoscopy d) Bone marrow aspiration 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's history of lung cancer and the current symptoms of easy bruising. The patient's low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) could be related to the previous radiation therapy or a new underlying condition.
Next, I need to consider the patient's other medications, including the thiazide diuretic and ACE inhibitor. These medications can cause thrombocytopenia as a side effect, but the patient's low platelet count is more severe than what would be expected from these medications alone.
Now, I need to consider the patient's negative serum antiplatelet antibody assay. This test rules out immune thrombocytopenia, a condition where the immune system attacks platelets.
Given the patient's history of lung cancer and the current symptoms of easy bruising, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis is to perform a CT scan of the chest to look for any signs of cancer recurrence or metastasis. This would be choice b) CT scan of the chest. 
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: A 16-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because she is concerned that she may have contracted meningitis from her soccer teammate, who was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis and admitted to the hospital yesterday. The patient's soccer team traveled to a neighboring state to participate in a tournament 1 week ago and she shared a hotel room with the girl who was hospitalized. The patient feels well but is concerned she may have ""caught the same bug."" Medical history is remarkable for asthma. Medications include inhaled albuterol. Vital signs are temperature 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse 64/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 107/58 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention for this patient at this time? Choices: a) Administer the meningococcal vaccine b) Prescribe doxycycline c) Prescribe penicillin d) Prescribe rifampin 
Output:
First, I need to assess the patient's risk of having contracted meningococcal meningitis. The patient shared a hotel room with the girl who was hospitalized, which increases her risk of exposure.
Next, I need to consider the patient's symptoms. The patient feels well and has no abnormalities on physical examination, which suggests that she is unlikely to have contracted the disease.
Now, I need to consider the patient's medical history. The patient has asthma, but this does not affect her risk of contracting meningococcal meningitis.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends prophylactic antibiotics for close contacts of patients with meningococcal meningitis. The recommended antibiotic is rifampin.
Therefore, the most appropriate intervention for this patient at this time is to prescribe rifampin. The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 19-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because, she says, ""I'm burning up."" Medical history is significant for intravenous drug use. Physical examination discloses a systolic heart murmur over the precordium. An expected physical finding will be which of the following? Choices: a) Decreased intensity of S1 b) Increased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration c) Increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration d) Positive Kussmaul sign (rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration) 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's medical history of intravenous drug use, which may be associated with endocarditis.
Next, I need to consider the physical examination finding of a systolic heart murmur over the precordium, which is consistent with endocarditis.
A murmur associated with endocarditis is typically a regurgitant murmur, which is best heard with the patient in a position that increases venous return to the heart, such as squatting or forced expiration.
Therefore, the expected physical finding is an increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration.
The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: A 26-year-old male police officer comes to the office for an annual health maintenance examination. He is physically active and feels well, but he notes that his asthma has been more active during the past month. He says that he has had to use his albuterol inhaler one to two times daily for wheezing and chest tightness. He has not had gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, productive cough, or fever. Medical history is remarkable for atopic allergies, especially to pollen and cats. He has had coldand exercise-induced asthma for the past 14 years. He takes no other medications. He is 188 cm (6 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 90 kg (200 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2. Vital signs are temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse 70/min, respirations 12/min, and blood pressure 120/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities except for scattered rhonchi and wheezes with forced expiration. Peak expiratory flow rate is 240 L/min. Which of the following is the most appropriate management? Choices: a) Chest x-ray b) Fexofenadine therapy c) Increased use of the albuterol inhaler d) Initiation of a daily corticosteroid inhaler 
Output:
First, I need to assess the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient has a history of atopic allergies, especially to pollen and cats, and has had cold- and exercise-induced asthma for the past 14 years. He has been using his albuterol inhaler one to two times daily for wheezing and chest tightness.
Next, I need to evaluate the patient's current symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient has scattered rhonchi and wheezes with forced expiration, and his peak expiratory flow rate is 240 L/min, which is within the normal range.
Now, I need to consider the patient's management options. The patient's symptoms are well-controlled with his current albuterol inhaler use, and there is no indication for increased use of the albuterol inhaler (option c). A chest x-ray (option a) is not indicated unless there is a suspicion of a complication such as pneumonia. Fexofenadine therapy (option b) may be beneficial for the patient's atopic allergies, but it is not the most appropriate management for his asthma symptoms. Initiation of a daily corticosteroid inhaler (option d) is the most appropriate management for the patient's asthma symptoms, as it will help to control his inflammation and prevent exacerbations.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A previously healthy 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department in August 1 hour after the onset of headache, dizziness, nausea, and one episode of vomiting. His symptoms began during the first hour of full-contact football practice in full uniform. He reported feeling weak and faint but did not lose consciousness. He vomited once after drinking water. On arrival, he is diaphoretic. He is not oriented to person, place, or time. His temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Choices: a) Obtain a CT scan of the head b) Administer sodium chloride tablets c) Administer intravenous fluids d) Immerse the patient in an ice water bath 
Output:
First, I need to assess the patient's condition. The patient is a 15-year-old boy who is experiencing symptoms such as headache, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting after participating in full-contact football practice. His temperature is elevated at 39.5°C (103.1°F), and his vital signs are tachycardic (120/min) and tachypneic (40/min). He is also diaphoretic and has a low blood pressure (90/65 mm Hg).
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of his symptoms. Given the context of full-contact football practice, heat-related illness is a strong possibility. The patient's symptoms, such as headache, dizziness, and nausea, are consistent with heat exhaustion or heat stroke.
Now, I need to determine the most appropriate next step in management. The patient's symptoms and vital signs suggest that he is experiencing heat-related illness, but the exact diagnosis (heat exhaustion or heat stroke) is not clear. However, the patient's altered mental status (not oriented to person, place, or time) and elevated temperature suggest that he may be experiencing heat stroke, which is a medical emergency.
Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous fluids to help lower the patient's body temperature and improve his circulatory status. This is option c) Administer intravenous fluids.

"Input: A new severe respiratory illness caused by a newly identified virus is discovered. Which of the following properties of a killed vaccine relative to a live vaccine is the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine for this illness? Choices: a) Avoids the concern for reversion to virulence b) Develops more rapid protective immunity c) Is less likely to require subsequent boosters for lifelong immunity d) Is most likely to generate mucosal immunity 
Output:
First, I need to understand the characteristics of killed and live vaccines. Killed vaccines are made from inactivated viruses, while live vaccines contain a weakened form of the virus.
Next, I need to consider the properties of killed and live vaccines. Killed vaccines are often used for diseases where the risk of severe illness is high, such as polio or influenza. They are also used for diseases where the risk of reversion to virulence is a concern, such as the smallpox vaccine.
Now, I need to consider the specific disease in question. A new severe respiratory illness caused by a newly identified virus is a high-risk disease, and the risk of reversion to virulence is a concern.
Therefore, the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine for this illness is to avoid the concern for reversion to virulence. The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 43-year-old man with a history of self-mutilation comes to the emergency department because of pain in his right thigh and shaking chills during the past 3 days. He says he intentionally burned his right thigh several times with a cigarette lighter 6 days ago. This morning he soaked his thigh in a tub of hot water and massaged it, after which a large amount of ""greenish fluid"" drained from the wound sites. The patient normally takes lithium carbonate but stopped 3 months ago after he lost his job. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Vital signs are temperature 39.2°C (102.5°F), pulse 170/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows an edematous right lateral thigh with multiple burn sites with a white exudative appearance. There is erythema surrounding the burn areas with red streaks extending up the thigh. Palpation of the burn sites discloses fluctuance. Results of laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 14 g/dL and a leukocyte count of 19,000/mm3. In addition to beginning antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate next step? Choices: a) Incision and drainage b) Psychiatric consultation c) Topical silver sulfadiazine d) Transfer to a burn center 
Output:
First, I need to assess the severity of the patient's condition. The patient has a history of self-mutilation and has intentionally burned his thigh, which is a serious injury. The patient is also experiencing pain, shaking chills, and has a high fever, which indicates a possible infection.
Next, I need to consider the patient's medical history. The patient has a history of self-mutilation, which may indicate a psychiatric condition. The patient also stopped taking lithium carbonate 3 months ago, which may be relevant to the patient's current condition.
Now, I need to evaluate the patient's physical examination. The patient has an edematous right lateral thigh with multiple burn sites, erythema, and red streaks extending up the thigh. The burn sites are also fluctuant, which indicates the presence of pus.
Based on the patient's condition, the most appropriate next step is to begin antibiotic therapy to treat the possible infection. However, the patient's condition is severe and requires further evaluation and treatment. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to transfer the patient to a burn center for further evaluation and treatment.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 32-year-old man comes to the physician because he has had difficulty focusing on tasks at work and at home during the past 2 months. He works as an automobile mechanic. He has had a lot of energy for work but often is distracted to the point that he does not complete assigned tasks. He frequently stops working on his own tasks to attempt to develop greater efficiency in his shop. He states that he is delighted with his newfound energy and reports that he now needs only 4 hours of sleep nightly. He has no history of psychiatric illness. He always performed well in school. He has a history of drinking alcohol excessively and using methamphetamines and cocaine during his 20s, but he has not consumed alcohol or used illicit drugs for the past 3 years. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 60/min, and blood pressure is 125/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, he describes his mood as ""good."" He has a labile affect. His speech is rapid in rate but normal in rhythm, and his thought process is organized. Short- and long-term memory are intact. Attention and concentration are fair; he makes no errors when performing serial sevens, and he can repeat seven digits forward and five in reverse sequence. He has had no delusions or hallucinations. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Choices: a) Antisocial personality disorder b) Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder c) Bipolar disorder d) Borderline personality disorder 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key symptoms presented by the patient. The patient reports difficulty focusing on tasks, being easily distracted, and needing only 4 hours of sleep nightly. He also mentions having a lot of energy for work.
Next, I need to consider the patient's history of substance abuse. He has a history of excessive alcohol consumption and use of methamphetamines and cocaine in his 20s, but he has not used these substances for the past 3 years.
Now, I need to evaluate the patient's mental status examination. He has a labile affect, rapid speech, and fair attention and concentration. However, his thought process is organized, and he has no delusions or hallucinations.
Considering the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD is characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which are consistent with the patient's reports of difficulty focusing and excessive energy. The patient's history of substance abuse may have contributed to his symptoms, but it is not the primary diagnosis.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 72-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of painless swelling of both ankles. She also reports shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down. She has been awakened from sleep by shortness of breath. She has not had chest pain. Her pulse is 96/min and regular, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg. Jugular venous pressure is 15 cm H2O. Pulmonary examination shows crackles at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm and a soft S3. A grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur is heard best at the apex, radiating to the axilla. There is 2+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis? Choices: a) Measurement of serum troponin I concentration b) ECG c) Exercise stress test d) Echocardiography 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms and signs presented in the case. The patient has a 2-month history of painless swelling of both ankles, shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down, and has been awakened from sleep by shortness of breath. She also has a regular pulse, high respirations, and elevated jugular venous pressure. The pulmonary examination shows crackles at both lung bases, and the cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm, a soft S3, and a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex radiating to the axilla. There is also 2+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these symptoms and signs. The patient's symptoms and signs are suggestive of heart failure, particularly left-sided heart failure. The presence of a holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex radiating to the axilla is suggestive of mitral regurgitation, a common cause of left-sided heart failure.
Now, I need to consider the diagnostic tests listed in the choices. The measurement of serum troponin I concentration (choice a) is used to diagnose myocardial infarction, which is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. The ECG (choice b) can show signs of heart failure, but it is not the most specific test for mitral regurgitation. The exercise stress test (choice c) is used to diagnose coronary artery disease, which is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. The echocardiography (choice d) is the most specific test for mitral regurgitation and can show the severity of the regurgitation and the size of the left ventricle, which is often enlarged in patients with mitral regurgitation.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 32-year-old man who is a jackhammer operator comes to the physician because of pain and swelling of his right arm for 3 days. The symptoms are moderately exacerbated by exertion. Examination of the right upper extremity shows erythema and moderate edema. Capillary refill time is less than 3 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Choices: a) Axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis b) Deep venous valvular insufficiency c) Superficial thrombophlebitis of the basilic vein d) Superior vena cava syndrome 
Output:
First, I need to consider the symptoms described. The patient has pain and swelling of his right arm, which is exacerbated by exertion. This suggests a musculoskeletal or vascular issue.
Next, I need to consider the location of the symptoms. The symptoms are localized to the right upper extremity, which suggests a problem with the veins or arteries in that area.
Now, I need to consider the characteristics of the symptoms. The symptoms include erythema (redness) and moderate edema (swelling), which suggests inflammation. The capillary refill time is less than 3 seconds, which suggests that the blood flow is not significantly impaired.
Based on these considerations, I would rule out options a) and d) because they are more severe conditions that would likely have more significant symptoms, such as severe pain and significant impairment of blood flow.
I would also rule out option b) because it is a chronic condition that would not typically present with acute symptoms.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is c) Superficial thrombophlebitis of the basilic vein, which is an inflammation of the veins in the arm caused by a blood clot.

"Input: A 63-year-old woman is in the hospital recovery room 4 hours after elective left hemicolectomy for colon carcinoma at the splenic flexure. She has a preoperative written directive for no blood products through transfusion for religious reasons. Medical history is significant for hypertension and coronary artery disease. The nurse tells you the patient's blood pressure has progressively declined since the operation. Vital signs now are temperature 35.8°C (96.4°F), pulse 130/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 80/50 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses a slightly distended abdomen with an intact incision. ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Urine output has been 10 mL during the past 2 hours. Hematocrit is 30%; preoperative hematocrit was 41%. The patient has received 4 L of intravenous crystalloid in the recovery room. Reported operative blood loss was 200 mL. Drainage from the nasogastric tube is clear. Damage to which of the following structures is most likely responsible for these findings? Choices: a) Epigastric artery b) Liver c) Middle colic artery d) Spleen 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key findings in the patient's condition. The patient has a low blood pressure (80/50 mm Hg), a high pulse rate (130/min), and a low urine output (10 mL during the past 2 hours). These findings suggest that the patient is experiencing hypovolemic shock, which is a condition characterized by a decrease in blood volume.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of hypovolemic shock in this patient. The patient has received 4 L of intravenous crystalloid, which should have helped to maintain blood volume. However, the patient's hematocrit has decreased from 41% to 30%, indicating a loss of red blood cells. The operative blood loss was reported to be 200 mL, which is not sufficient to cause significant hypovolemic shock.
Considering the patient's symptoms and the anatomy of the surgical site, I need to identify the structure that is most likely to be damaged. The patient underwent a left hemicolectomy, which involves the removal of the left side of the colon. The middle colic artery is a branch of the superior mesenteric artery that supplies blood to the transverse colon, which is not involved in this surgery. The epigastric artery is a branch of the external iliac artery that supplies blood to the abdominal wall, and damage to this artery would not cause significant bleeding into the peritoneal cavity. The liver is not involved in this surgery, and damage to the liver would not cause significant bleeding into the peritoneal cavity. The spleen is a highly vascular organ that is located near the surgical site, and damage to the spleen could cause significant bleeding into the peritoneal cavity.
Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's hypovolemic shock is damage to the spleen. {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of abdominal pain. She has a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis. She has thick nasal secretions. She says that her sweat is salty and crystallizes on her skin. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows epigastric tenderness. Genetic testing for the 36 most common mutations shows a detectable mutation (G551D) in one allele of the CFTR gene. Which of the following best explains this patient's clinical phenotype? Choices: a) Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR b) The patient is a CFTR obligate carrier c) The patient's CFTR mutation is unrelated to her clinical phenotype d) The second CFTR mutation was not detected by the testing obtained 
Output:
First, I need to understand the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient has a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis, which are common symptoms of cystic fibrosis (CF). The patient also has thick nasal secretions, salty sweat, and epigastric tenderness, which are characteristic of CF.
Next, I need to understand the genetic testing results. The patient has a detectable mutation (G551D) in one allele of the CFTR gene. This means that the patient has a mutation in one of the two copies of the CFTR gene.
Now, I need to consider the options. Option a) suggests that only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR to cause the patient's clinical phenotype. However, CF typically requires two defective CFTR alleles to cause the disease. Option b) suggests that the patient is a CFTR obligate carrier, but this would mean that the patient has two normal CFTR alleles, which is not the case. Option c) suggests that the patient's CFTR mutation is unrelated to her clinical phenotype, but the symptoms and medical history suggest that the mutation is related to the patient's CFTR. Option d) suggests that the second CFTR mutation was not detected by the testing obtained, which is a plausible explanation for the patient's clinical phenotype.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms. He has increasing confusion, is unable to answer questions, and has a history of excessive drinking and experimenting with illicit drugs. He also has a high fever, tachycardia, and hypertension, as well as profuse diaphoresis and muscle rigidity.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these symptoms. Amphetamine intoxication can cause agitation and confusion, but it is less likely to cause muscle rigidity and a high fever. Bacterial meningitis can cause confusion and fever, but it is less likely to cause muscle rigidity and a history of substance abuse. Delirium tremens is a complication of alcohol withdrawal, but it is less likely to cause muscle rigidity and a high fever.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare but life-threatening side effect of antipsychotic medication, characterized by fever, muscle rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction. Given the patient's history of seeing a psychiatrist and being prescribed medication, as well as his symptoms of fever, muscle rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction, NMS is the most likely explanation for his symptoms.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 16-year-old boy is admitted to the emergency department because of a knife wound to the left side of his chest. An x-ray of the chest shows an air-fluid level in the left side of the chest, partial collapse of the left lung, and elevation of the stomach bubble. The mediastinum is in the midline. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Choices: a) Hemopneumothorax, not under tension b) Hemothorax, not under tension c) Pneumothorax, not under tension d) Tension hemopneumothorax 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the symptoms described in the scenario. The patient has a knife wound to the left side of his chest, which suggests trauma to the chest.
The x-ray shows an air-fluid level in the left side of the chest, which indicates the presence of both air and fluid in the pleural space. This is consistent with a hemopneumothorax.
The partial collapse of the left lung suggests that there is something in the pleural space that is preventing the lung from expanding normally.
The elevation of the stomach bubble suggests that there is increased pressure in the thoracic cavity, which is pushing the stomach upwards.
The mediastinum is in the midline, which suggests that there is no significant shift of the mediastinum to one side, which would be expected in a tension pneumothorax.
Now, I need to consider the options. A hemopneumothorax is a collection of blood and air in the pleural space, which is consistent with the symptoms described.
A hemothorax is a collection of blood in the pleural space, but there is no mention of blood in the x-ray description.
A pneumothorax is a collection of air in the pleural space, but there is also a mention of fluid, which makes this option less likely.
A tension hemopneumothorax is a collection of blood and air in the pleural space that is under increased pressure, which would cause the mediastinum to shift to the opposite side. However, the mediastinum is in the midline, which makes this option less likely.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 72-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit for pain management and observation of ventricular ectopy 4 hours after undergoing uncomplicated left total knee replacement. He is receiving fentanyl via systemic patient-controlled analgesic pump for pain management. Medical history is remarkable for coronary artery disease, for which he takes atorvastatin, furosemide, carvedilol, lisinopril, and 81-mg aspirin. Baseline echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 0.20. Vital signs now are temperature 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse 90/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination discloses no unexpected abnormalities. Which of the following regimens for prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis will likely be most beneficial in this patient? Choices: a) Continuous application of bilateral lower extremity pneumatic compression devices b) Continuous intravenous infusion of heparin titrated to a PTT of 1.5 to 2.0 times the control value c) Oral warfarin d) Subcutaneous enoxaparin 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's medical history and current condition. The patient has coronary artery disease and is taking several medications, including aspirin, which is a blood thinner. The patient also has a history of ventricular ectopy, which is a type of abnormal heart rhythm.
Next, I need to consider the patient's current condition. The patient has a fever, tachycardia, and a slightly elevated blood pressure. The patient's oxygen saturation is normal, and the physical examination is unremarkable.
Now, I need to consider the options for prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Option a) Continuous application of bilateral lower extremity pneumatic compression devices is a mechanical method of DVT prophylaxis, which may be beneficial in patients who are at high risk of bleeding. Option b) Continuous intravenous infusion of heparin titrated to a PTT of 1.5 to 2.0 times the control value is a pharmacological method of DVT prophylaxis, which may be beneficial in patients who are at high risk of DVT. Option c) Oral warfarin is a pharmacological method of DVT prophylaxis, which may be beneficial in patients who are at high risk of DVT, but it may take several days to take effect. Option d) Subcutaneous enoxaparin is a pharmacological method of DVT prophylaxis, which may be beneficial in patients who are at high risk of DVT.
Considering the patient's medical history and current condition, the most beneficial regimen for prophylaxis of DVT would be option b) Continuous intravenous infusion of heparin titrated to a PTT of 1.5 to 2.0 times the control value. This is because the patient is at high risk of DVT due to the recent surgery and the history of ventricular ectopy, and heparin is a more effective anticoagulant than the other options.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

Choices: a) Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto disease) b) Defect in thyroxine (T4) biosynthesis c) Graves disease d) Multinodular goiter 
Output:
First, I need to identify the symptoms presented by the patient. The patient has fatigue, dry skin, brittle hair, swelling of the ankles, and cold intolerance, which are all symptoms of hypothyroidism.
Next, I need to consider the patient's age and the duration of symptoms. The patient is 67 years old and has had symptoms for 1 year, which is consistent with primary hypothyroidism.
Now, I need to consider the patient's physical examination findings. The patient has dry skin, a nontender thyroid gland that is enlarged to two times its normal size, mild edema of the ankles bilaterally, and a prolonged relaxation phase of the Achilles reflex, all of which are consistent with hypothyroidism.
Considering the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, I need to consider the possible causes of hypothyroidism. The patient's age and the duration of symptoms make primary hypothyroidism more likely than secondary hypothyroidism.
Among the possible causes of primary hypothyroidism, I need to consider the patient's thyroid gland examination. The patient has a nontender thyroid gland that is enlarged to two times its normal size, which is consistent with a multinodular goiter.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 2-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother for follow-up of a chromosome analysis done 1 month ago. The child has minor dysmorphic features, and growth and developmental delay. Chromosome analysis showed a small unbalanced chromosome translocation, with extra chromosomal material at the tip of chromosome 3. The cytogenetics laboratory requested blood samples from both parents for follow-up studies. The parents are divorced, and the mother has custody of the child. The relationship between the parents is hostile. The mother has been tested and has normal chromosomes without evidence of translocation. At today's visit, she reacts angrily when the issue of contacting the child's father for testing is raised. She states that he abandoned them and that he has no interest in his child. She refuses to cooperate in contacting the father, who could be a translocation carrier. You do not know the father, but an office worker told you that he lives in a nearby town. The mother says that he is living with a new girlfriend. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step? Choices: a) Attempt to identify the father's physician and work with that physician to obtain chromosome studies on the father b) Contact the father by telephone and arrange for him to give a blood sample at a local hospital c) Document your attempts to work with the mother but proceed no further, since you have no physician-patient relationship with the father d) Help the mother deal with her anger and educate her regarding the potential benefit to her son and others if the father's chromosome studies are done 
Output:
First, I need to consider the mother's rights and the child's best interests. The mother has custody of the child, and it is her responsibility to ensure the child's well-being.
Next, I need to consider the potential risks and benefits of contacting the father. If the father is a translocation carrier, his chromosome studies could provide valuable information for the child's diagnosis and treatment.
However, contacting the father could also be emotionally challenging for the mother and the child, especially given the hostile relationship between the parents.
Therefore, I need to consider alternative approaches that balance the mother's rights and the child's best interests.
One option is to attempt to identify the father's physician and work with that physician to obtain chromosome studies on the father. This approach respects the mother's autonomy and avoids direct contact with the father.
Another option is to document my attempts to work with the mother but proceed no further, since I have no physician-patient relationship with the father. This approach acknowledges the mother's rights and the child's best interests while also respecting the boundaries of my professional relationship with the mother.
The most appropriate next step is to attempt to identify the father's physician and work with that physician to obtain chromosome studies on the father. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

There is edema and tenderness behind the left ear. Otoscopic examination shows a red, dull, left tympanic membrane that does not move. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Choices: a) Acoustic neuroma b) Labyrinthitis c) Lateral sinus thrombosis d) Mastoiditis 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key symptoms presented in the case. The girl has fever and left ear pain for 3 days, and she has been treated with amoxicillin for the past 5 days for left otitis media. However, despite the treatment, her symptoms persist.
Next, I need to consider the physical examination findings. The girl has a displaced left ear, edema, and tenderness behind the left ear. The otoscopic examination shows a red, dull, left tympanic membrane that does not move.
Now, I need to consider the possible diagnoses. Acoustic neuroma (choice a) is a benign tumor that affects the nerve that connects the inner ear to the brain, but it is not typically associated with fever, ear pain, or a displaced ear. Labyrinthitis (choice b) is an inner ear infection that can cause vertigo, hearing loss, and ear pain, but it is not typically associated with a displaced ear or edema behind the ear. Lateral sinus thrombosis (choice c) is a blood clot in the lateral sinus that can cause fever, headache, and neck stiffness, but it is not typically associated with a displaced ear or edema behind the ear. Mastoiditis (choice d) is an infection of the mastoid bone that can cause fever, ear pain, and a displaced ear, and it is often associated with a red, dull tympanic membrane that does not move.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'd'}"

Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of the development of shortness of breath in this patient? Choices: a) Apraclonidine b) Epinephrine c) Latanoprost d) Timolol 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's condition. The patient has glaucoma and has been using eyedrops for it.
Next, I need to consider the potential side effects of the eyedrops. The patient has developed shortness of breath, which is a respiratory symptom.
Now, I need to consider the potential causes of shortness of breath in this patient. The patient has a history of smoking, which can lead to respiratory problems.
Considering the options, I need to identify the eyedrop that is most likely to cause shortness of breath. Apraclonidine is an alpha-2 agonist, epinephrine is a sympathomimetic agent, latanoprost is a prostaglandin analog, and timolol is a beta-blocker.
Beta-blockers are known to exacerbate respiratory problems, especially in patients with a history of smoking. Therefore, the most likely cause of the development of shortness of breath in this patient is the timolol eyedrops.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 38-year-old man with Down syndrome and severe mental retardation is brought to the emergency department by ambulance because of increasing lethargy for the past several hours. The patient is noncommunicative and you are unable to obtain an initial history of his present illness or a past medical history. You do not know if he takes any medications. Vital signs are temperature 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse 90/min, respirations 19/min, and blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. On physical examination the patient is awake but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses clear lungs; cardiac examination discloses a systolic click. Neurologic examination shows decreased muscle tone. Serum electrolyte concentrations are normal. Complete blood count shows a leukocyte count of 18,000/mm3 with 23% band neutrophils. The patient's caregiver, who is also the patient's guardian, cannot be located and staff at the group home where the patient resides cannot be reached by telephone. The patient refuses lumbar puncture for examination of cerebrospinal fluid. Toxicologic screening of the urine is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step? Choices: a) Administer intravenous antibiotics b) Await contact with the caregiver before proceeding with management c) Obtain CT scan of the head d) Obtain echocardiography 
Output:
First, I need to assess the patient's condition. The patient is lethargic, has a fever, and a high leukocyte count, which suggests an infection. The patient's decreased muscle tone and systolic click on cardiac examination are also concerning.
Next, I need to consider the patient's inability to communicate and the lack of information about his medical history. The patient's caregiver and guardian are also unavailable, which makes it difficult to make decisions about his care.
Now, I need to prioritize the patient's safety and well-being. Given the patient's condition and the lack of information, the most appropriate next step is to obtain a CT scan of the head to rule out any potential causes of his lethargy, such as a brain abscess or other intracranial infection. This is a critical step to ensure the patient's safety and to guide further management.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: After being severely beaten and sustaining a gunshot wound to the abdomen, a 42-year-old woman undergoes resection of a perforated small bowel. During the operation, plastic reconstruction of facial fractures, and open reduction and internal fixation of the left femur are also done. Thirty-six hours postoperatively, she is awake but not completely alert. She is receiving intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled pump. She says that she needs the morphine to treat her pain, but she is worried that she is becoming addicted. She has no history of substance use disorder. She drinks one to two glasses of wine weekly. Which of the following initial actions by the physician is most appropriate? Choices: a) Reassure the patient that her chance of becoming addicted to narcotics is minuscule b) Maintain the morphine, but periodically administer intravenous naloxone c) Switch the patient to oral acetaminophen as soon as she can take medication orally d) Switch the patient to intramuscular lorazepam 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's current situation. She is 36 hours postoperatively and is receiving intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled pump. She is awake but not completely alert and is expressing concerns about addiction.
Next, I need to consider the patient's history. She has no history of substance use disorder and drinks only one to two glasses of wine weekly, which is not a significant risk factor for addiction.
Now, I need to consider the potential risks and benefits of each option. Option a) is reassuring, but it may not address the patient's concerns. Option b) is not appropriate because naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can precipitate withdrawal in patients who are physically dependent on opioids. Option d) is not appropriate because lorazepam is a benzodiazepine, and the patient is already receiving morphine, which is an opioid.
Therefore, the most appropriate initial action is to switch the patient to oral acetaminophen as soon as she can take medication orally, which is option c). This option addresses the patient's concerns about addiction and reduces the risk of opioid-related side effects.

First, I need to identify the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a 6-month history of abdominal bloating, upper abdominal discomfort, and constipation. The symptoms are more severe when she is preparing for examinations but improve after bowel movements.
Next, I need to consider the patient's physical examination and laboratory results. The physical examination shows no other abnormalities, and the complete blood count and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges.
Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, I suspect that she may have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits.
Considering the patient's symptoms and medical history, I need to choose the most appropriate pharmacotherapy. The options are azathioprine, infliximab, lubiprostone, and mesalamine.
Azathioprine and infliximab are immunomodulators that are typically used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. However, the patient's symptoms and medical history do not suggest IBD.
Mesalamine is a medication that is used to treat IBD, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient.
Lubiprostone is a medication that is used to treat constipation, which is one of the patient's symptoms. It works by increasing the amount of fluid in the intestines and promoting bowel movements.
Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 22-year-old woman comes to the office because of urticaria. This is her first episode of urticaria and it has occurred and then resolved several times in the past week.

His neurologic findings are most likely due to a lesion involving which of the following? Choices: a) Muscle membrane b) Parasympathetic nervous system c) Peripheral nerve d) Presynaptic neuromuscular junction 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key symptoms presented by the patient. The patient has a 7-month history of leg weakness, dry eyes and mouth, and a 10.4-kg weight loss over the past 4 months. He also has difficulty rising from a chair and moderate weakness of proximal muscles of the lower extremities.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these symptoms. The patient's symptoms suggest a disorder affecting the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions such as heart rate, digestion, and respiration.
The patient's examination shows mild ptosis, a barrel-shaped chest, distant breath sounds, and absent reflexes. These findings are consistent with a disorder affecting the autonomic nervous system, specifically the parasympathetic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions such as heart rate, digestion, and respiration.
The patient's x-ray shows a hyperinflated chest and a 3 x 4-cm mass in the right hilum, which is likely a lung tumor. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are most likely due to a lesion involving the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the autonomic control of the lungs and other organs.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 4-year-old boy is brought for a follow-up examination. He has a history of chronic recurrent otitis media and recently completed a 10-day course of antibiotics. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows clear ear canals and intact tympanic membranes; a brown, irregular mass is visualized behind the tympanic membrane. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings? Choices: a) Epithelial tissue proliferation b) Lingual papillae loss c) Middle ear effusion d) Midface hypoplasia 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's history of chronic recurrent otitis media. This suggests that the patient may have a condition that affects the ear.
Next, I need to examine the patient's current symptoms. The patient has a brown, irregular mass behind the tympanic membrane, which suggests a growth or tumor.
Considering the patient's history and current symptoms, I need to consider the possible causes of the mass. Epithelial tissue proliferation (choice a) is a possible cause of a mass, but it is not the most likely explanation given the patient's history of otitis media.
Lingual papillae loss (choice b) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms, as the mass is behind the tympanic membrane, not on the tongue.
Middle ear effusion (choice c) is a possible cause of a mass, but it is not the most likely explanation given the patient's history of otitis media and the description of the mass as brown and irregular.
Midface hypoplasia (choice d) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms, as the mass is behind the tympanic membrane, not related to the midface.
The most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms is a cholesteatoma, which is a type of skin cyst that can form in the middle ear. Cholesteatomas are often associated with chronic otitis media and can cause a brown, irregular mass behind the tympanic membrane.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

Which of the following relationships best describes the rationale for the physician's recommendation that the patient inform his wife of his condition rather than withhold this information? Choices: a) autonomy overrides beneficence b) autonomy overrides justice c) beneficence overrides autonomy d) nonmaleficence overrides autonomy 
Output:
First, I need to understand the situation. The patient has tested positive for HIV and is reluctant to inform his wife about his condition.
The physician is recommending that the patient inform his wife because she could also be HIV positive.
To determine the correct answer, I need to consider the principles of medical ethics. Autonomy refers to the patient's right to make decisions about their own care. Beneficence refers to the physician's duty to act in the best interest of the patient. Justice refers to the fair distribution of resources and benefits. Nonmaleficence refers to the physician's duty to do no harm.
In this situation, the physician is prioritizing the wife's potential health and well-being over the patient's autonomy to keep his condition private.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 10-year-old boy is brought for a follow-up examination 2 days after he was seen in the emergency department because of hives, hoarseness, and light-headedness. His symptoms began 15 minutes after he was stung by a bee and lasted approximately 60 minutes; they resolved before he was treated. He has been stung by bees three times over the past year, and each reaction has been more severe. Examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation to prevent future morbidity and mortality from this condition? Choices: a) Avoid areas known to have bees b) Avoid wearing colorful clothing outside c) Carrying diphenhydramine tablets d) Carrying self-injectable epinephrine 
Output:
First, I need to identify the condition the boy is suffering from. The symptoms of hives, hoarseness, and light-headedness that began after a bee sting and lasted for 60 minutes suggest anaphylaxis.
Next, I need to consider the severity of the boy's reactions. The fact that each reaction has been more severe over the past year indicates a progressive increase in severity, which is a hallmark of anaphylaxis.
Now, I need to consider the appropriate recommendation to prevent future morbidity and mortality from this condition. Given the severity of the boy's reactions, the most appropriate recommendation is to carry self-injectable epinephrine, which is a lifesaving treatment for anaphylaxis.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being discovered semiconscious and incoherent at home. On arrival, he is stuporous. His blood pressure is 105/70 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination shows cool, damp skin. The pupils are pinpoint and react sluggishly to light. Which of the following is the most likely substance taken? Choices: a) Alcohol b) Barbiturates c) Cocaine d) Heroin 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key symptoms presented in the scenario. The patient is semiconscious and incoherent, which suggests altered mental status. The cool, damp skin and pinpoint pupils are also indicative of a specific substance.
Next, I need to consider the effects of each substance listed. Alcohol typically causes slurred speech, ataxia, and dilated pupils, which does not match the patient's symptoms. Barbiturates can cause sedation, but they also typically cause dilated pupils, which is not consistent with the patient's pinpoint pupils. Cocaine can cause agitation, tachycardia, and dilated pupils, which does not match the patient's symptoms. Heroin, on the other hand, can cause sedation, pinpoint pupils, and respiratory depression, which matches the patient's symptoms.
Therefore, the most likely substance taken is heroin. {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 52-year-old female presents to the office with the complaint of greenish discharge from her left nipple. There is no history of trauma or fever, and the patient is not currently using oral contraceptives nor is she on hormone replacement therapy. Her last pregnancy was approximately 20 years ago. Physical examination findings are normal except for the green discharge. The most likely cause of this patient's presenting complaint is Choices: a) breast cancer b) fibrocystic disease c) mammary duct ectasia d) pituitary adenoma 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and history. The patient is a 52-year-old female presenting with greenish discharge from her left nipple. This symptom is not typical of breast cancer, which is more commonly associated with a palpable mass or skin changes.
Next, I need to consider the patient's history. The patient is not currently using oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, which can sometimes cause breast discharge. Her last pregnancy was approximately 20 years ago, which makes it less likely that the discharge is related to pregnancy or lactation.
The patient's physical examination findings are normal except for the green discharge. This suggests that the discharge is not related to a palpable mass or skin changes, which would be more typical of breast cancer.
Considering the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely cause of her presenting complaint is mammary duct ectasia. This is a benign condition that can cause greenish discharge from the nipple, and it is more common in postmenopausal women.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 15-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother because he has been tired and irritable for the past 3 months. He is a high school freshman and a member of the track team. He reports that his symptoms began shortly after starting spring training. He practices sprints 5 nights a week and runs 2 to 5 miles several days a week in addition to leg training with weights. He admits to being tired and says the training is becoming more intense and that he is a little concerned about his ability to continue on the team. His appetite has been unchanged. Medical history is unremarkable and he takes no medications. He has been your patient for the past 3 years. He seems more sullen than you remember from previous visits. You ask his mother to leave the examining room while you complete the physical examination. After she leaves the room, he admits that he is worried about some lumps in his groin. It is most appropriate to obtain additional history regarding which of the following? Choices: a) Fever and chills b) Mood symptoms c) School performance d) Sexual activity 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and the context in which they are occurring. The patient is a high school freshman who has been experiencing fatigue and irritability for the past 3 months, which began shortly after starting spring training for the track team.
Next, I need to consider the patient's physical examination and the information he has provided. The patient has been experiencing lumps in his groin, which he has been too embarrassed to discuss with his mother present.
Now, I need to consider the potential causes of the patient's symptoms and the information that would be most relevant to obtaining a diagnosis. The patient's symptoms of fatigue and irritability could be related to a variety of factors, including overtraining, sleep deprivation, or underlying medical conditions. However, the presence of lumps in the groin suggests the possibility of a more serious condition, such as testicular cancer.
Therefore, it is most appropriate to obtain additional history regarding sexual activity, as this could be relevant to the patient's risk of testicular cancer. {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: An 18-year-old primigravid woman comes for her initial prenatal visit at 16 weeks' gestation. She is not sure about the date of her last menstrual period but says that the pregnancy probably occurred immediately after she stopped taking oral contraceptives 5 months ago. Maternal serum α-fetoprotein (MSAFP) concentration is increased to 3 multiples of the median. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? Choices: a) Repeat measurement of MSAFP concentration b) Triple screening for MSAFP, serum β-hCG, and serum estriol concentrations c) Ultrasonography d) Amniocentesis for measurement of α-fetoprotein concentration 
Output:
First, I need to determine the gestational age of the fetus. The woman is 16 weeks pregnant, but she is not sure about the date of her last menstrual period. She says that the pregnancy probably occurred immediately after she stopped taking oral contraceptives 5 months ago. This means that the pregnancy is likely to be 5 months old, which is equivalent to 20 weeks' gestation.
Next, I need to interpret the MSAFP concentration. The MSAFP concentration is increased to 3 multiples of the median, which is a significant increase. This suggests that there may be a problem with the fetus, such as a neural tube defect or a chromosomal abnormality.
Now, I need to determine the most appropriate next step in management. The increased MSAFP concentration requires further evaluation to determine the cause. Ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step in management because it can provide information about the fetus's anatomy and detect any potential problems.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 25-year-old woman comes to the office because of a 6-month history of increasingly severe low back pain and heavy menses. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 75/min, respirations are 13/min, and blood pressure is 115/79 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An endometrial biopsy specimen shows regular tubular endometrial glands with abundant mitotic figures in the endometrial glands and stroma. Which of the following proteins or enzymes regulate the progression of cells into this phase of this patient's menstrual cycle? Choices: a) AMP-dependent kinases b) Cyclin-dependent kinases c) Hexokinases d) Lipid kinases 
Output:
First, I need to identify the phase of the menstrual cycle that the patient is in. The patient has a 6-month history of low back pain and heavy menses, which suggests that she may be experiencing endometriosis. The endometrial biopsy specimen shows regular tubular endometrial glands with abundant mitotic figures, which is consistent with endometriosis.
Next, I need to understand the pathophysiology of endometriosis. Endometriosis is characterized by the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, which can lead to inflammation, scarring, and adhesions. The growth of endometrial tissue is regulated by hormones, particularly estrogen.
Now, I need to identify the proteins or enzymes that regulate the progression of cells into the phase of the menstrual cycle that the patient is in. The patient is likely in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, during which the endometrium thickens in response to estrogen. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are a family of enzymes that play a key role in regulating the cell cycle, including the G1 phase, which is the phase of the cell cycle during which the endometrium thickens in response to estrogen. CDKs work by phosphorylating and activating other proteins, which leads to the progression of cells into the S phase of the cell cycle.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 63-year-old woman comes to the physician 1 day after the sudden onset of pain and swelling of her right knee. She has had no injury. Her medications include occasional ibuprofen for mild osteoarthritis of both knees. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 97/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 129/79 mm Hg. Examination of the right knee shows warmth, erythema, and effusion. Exquisite tenderness is produced with minimal range-of-motion testing. Examination of synovial fluid obtained via joint aspiration shows that it is clear, with positively birefringent rhomboids observed under polarized light microscopy. Deposition of which of the following substances is the most likely cause of these findings? Choices: a) Ammonium urate b) Calcium oxalate c) Calcium pyrophosphate d) Calcium urate 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key findings in the case. The patient has sudden onset pain and swelling of her right knee, with warmth, erythema, and effusion. The synovial fluid is clear, but there are positively birefringent rhomboids observed under polarized light microscopy.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these findings. The presence of positively birefringent rhomboids in the synovial fluid is characteristic of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease.
Now, I need to evaluate the other options. Ammonium urate crystals are typically negatively birefringent, calcium oxalate crystals are typically negatively birefringent, and calcium urate crystals are not typically associated with this pattern of synovial fluid findings.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 64-year-old female presents to the office with the complaint of difficulty swallowing saliva for about 6 months. She has slurred speech. Examination of the tongue reveals wasting and fasciculation. Decreased deep tendon reflexes and fasciculation are noted in the left lower extremity. The deep tendon reflexes of the left upper extremity are hyperactive. The most likely diagnosis is Choices: a) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis b) Friedreich ataxia c) Pick disease d) progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key symptoms presented by the patient. The patient has difficulty swallowing saliva, slurred speech, wasting and fasciculation of the tongue, decreased deep tendon reflexes, and fasciculation in the left lower extremity, along with hyperactive deep tendon reflexes in the left upper extremity.
Next, I need to consider the possible causes of these symptoms. The combination of muscle weakness, wasting, and fasciculation, along with decreased deep tendon reflexes, suggests a motor neuron disorder.
Now, I need to evaluate the options. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a motor neuron disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness, wasting, and fasciculation, along with decreased deep tendon reflexes. The patient's symptoms, including difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, and wasting and fasciculation of the tongue, are consistent with ALS. Friedreich ataxia is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the cerebellum and spinal cord, leading to ataxia, dysarthria, and areflexia, but it does not typically present with fasciculation. Pick disease is a type of frontotemporal dementia that primarily affects the frontal and temporal lobes, leading to changes in personality, behavior, and language, but it does not typically present with motor symptoms. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is a rare and usually fatal viral disease that affects the white matter of the brain, leading to cognitive decline and motor symptoms, but it is not typically associated with fasciculation.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Four days after undergoing open reduction and internal fixation of a fracture of the right femur sustained in a motor vehicle collision, a 47-year-old man continues to have agitation and confusion despite treatment with haloperidol. He has mild hypertension. Other medications include acetaminophen, atenolol, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 168/98 mm Hg. During the examination, he is uncooperative and refuses to answer questions. Neurologic examination shows tremulousness and no focal findings. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. A CT scan of the head shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings? Choices: a) Adverse effect of medication b) Alcohol withdrawal c) Fat emboli d) Sepsis 
Output:
First, I need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient has agitation and confusion, which are symptoms of delirium. He has been treated with haloperidol, which is a medication that can cause extrapyramidal side effects, such as tremulousness.
Next, I need to consider the patient's medical history. The patient has a history of hypertension, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, there is no indication of a cardiovascular event or sepsis.
Now, I need to consider the patient's current medications. The patient is taking haloperidol, acetaminophen, atenolol, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. Haloperidol is a medication that can cause delirium as a side effect, especially in elderly patients or patients with a history of substance abuse.
Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is an adverse effect of medication, specifically haloperidol. {'sol': 'a'}"

During this period, she also has had memory lapses, difficulty concentrating, and has been reprimanded at work for arriving late. Over the past 2 weeks, she has had three episodes of palpitations and shortness of breath that have awakened her from sleep. Her pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 110/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Mental status examination shows a depressed mood and constricted affect. She says that she is no longer interested in activities that she used to enjoy. She has suicidal ideation without a plan. Her hemoglobin concentration is 11 g/dL, and serum ferritin concentration is 140 ng/mL. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in treatment? Choices: a) Donepezil therapy b) Ferrous sulfate therapy c) Ginkgo biloba extract therapy d) Paroxetine therapy 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient has difficulty sleeping, fatigue, muscle tension, memory lapses, difficulty concentrating, palpitations, shortness of breath, depressed mood, constricted affect, and suicidal ideation. These symptoms have been present for 8 weeks.
Next, I need to consider the patient's laboratory results. The patient's hemoglobin concentration is 11 g/dL, which is below the normal range, and the serum ferritin concentration is 140 ng/mL, which is within the normal range.
Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, I suspect that the patient has iron deficiency anemia, which is causing her fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitations. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in treatment is to address the iron deficiency anemia.
The most appropriate initial step in treatment is to start ferrous sulfate therapy to increase the patient's iron levels. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 40-year-old man with paranoid schizophrenia is transferred to the emergency department from the residential facility where he lives 2 hours after having swallowed a nail. The patient says he does not have any symptoms. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. His only current medication is haloperidol. The patient is not in acute distress. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Mental status examination discloses a flat affect, distractibility, and derailment of thoughts. X-ray of the abdomen is obtained and shows a 4-cm nail in the left upper quadrant. No free air is visible. After admitting the patient to the hospital, which of the following is the most appropriate management? Choices: a) Administration of ipecac to induce vomiting and expectoration of the nail b) Observation to allow passage of the nail via normal peristalsis c) Open laparotomy and removal of the nail through a gastrotomy incision d) Removal of the nail through endoscopic esophagogastroscopy 
Output:
First, I need to consider the location of the nail. The X-ray shows that the nail is in the left upper quadrant, which suggests that it is in the stomach.
Next, I need to consider the patient's symptoms. The patient says he does not have any symptoms, but the mental status examination shows a flat affect, distractibility, and derailment of thoughts, which are consistent with the patient's history of paranoid schizophrenia.
Now, I need to consider the risks and benefits of each option. Option a) is not appropriate because inducing vomiting could cause aspiration of the nail. Option c) is not appropriate because it is a major surgical procedure with significant risks. Option d) is not appropriate because it is not a standard procedure for removing a swallowed object.
Therefore, the most appropriate management is to observe the patient and allow the nail to pass through the digestive system via normal peristalsis. The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after he had an episode of chest pain radiating to his jaw while shoveling snow. His pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows an S4. While undergoing an ECG, the patient says that he feels the chest pain returning. The most appropriate immediate treatment is a drug with which of the following mechanisms of action? Choices: a) Increases cAMP concentration b) Increases nitric oxide concentration c) Inhibits potassium flux d) Inhibits sodium flux 
Output:
First, I need to identify the patient's condition. The patient is experiencing chest pain radiating to his jaw while shoveling snow, which is a classic symptom of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
Next, the patient's symptoms are worsening, as indicated by the return of chest pain during the ECG. This suggests that the patient is experiencing a myocardial infarction (MI).
The most appropriate immediate treatment for MI is a drug that rapidly reduces myocardial oxygen demand. One such drug is a beta-blocker, which works by inhibiting sodium flux into the cardiac myocytes, thereby reducing heart rate and contractility.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
