"Input: Consider the following statements: (1) In every country, people think other individuals in their country are less happy than they actually are. (2) In the United States, women’s happiness has increased both absolutely and relative to men. Which of these statements is True/False? Choices: a) True, True b) True, False c) False, True d) False, False 
Output:
First, let's analyze statement (1). It claims that in every country, people believe others in their country are less happy than they truly are. This statement is likely to be true. It reflects a common psychological phenomenon called ""relative deprivation,"" where individuals tend to compare themselves to others and feel worse off when they perceive others as having more. 
Next, let's examine statement (2). It states that women's happiness has increased both absolutely and relatively to men in the United States. This statement is also likely to be true. Numerous studies have shown that women's happiness levels have been rising in recent decades, and they are now closing the gap with men in terms of overall well-being.

First, we need to consider the historical context of the Social Security Act. It was a major piece of legislation passed during the Great Depression, aimed at providing a safety net for the elderly and unemployed. 
Second, we need to think about the public sentiment during that time. The Depression had caused widespread hardship and uncertainty, making people more receptive to government programs that offered security.
