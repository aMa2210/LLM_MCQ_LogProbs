"Input: The activity of creatine kinase is: Choices: a) increased when intracellular ADP rises. b) increased when muscle pH falls below 6.9. c) always lower in Type II fibres than Type I fibres. d) increased after a period of endurance training. 
Output:
First, we need to understand what creatine kinase does. Creatine kinase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in energy metabolism, specifically in the regeneration of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the primary energy currency of cells.

Second, we need to consider the context of each choice. 

* a) Increased when intracellular ADP rises: ADP (adenosine diphosphate) is a byproduct of ATP breakdown. When intracellular ADP levels rise, it signals a need for more ATP. Creatine kinase activity would indeed increase to meet this demand.

* b) Increased when muscle pH falls below 6.9: A decrease in muscle pH (acidosis) occurs during intense exercise. This acidic environment can inhibit enzyme activity, including creatine kinase.

* c) Always lower in Type II fibres than Type I fibres: Type II muscle fibres are fast-twitch and rely more on anaerobic metabolism, which generates more ATP but also more lactate. Type I fibres are slow-twitch and rely more on aerobic metabolism. Creatine kinase activity is generally higher in Type II fibres due to their higher energy demands.

* d) Increased after a period of endurance training: Endurance training leads to adaptations in muscle metabolism, including increased mitochondrial density and improved aerobic capacity. While creatine kinase activity may increase slightly, the primary adaptations are not directly related to this enzyme.

"Input: Approximately how many kJ of energy are expended if an athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake averages 3.0 l/min for 5 minutes of exercise? Choices: a) 60 kJ b) 150 kJ c) 300 kJ d) 500 kJ 
Output:
First, we need to calculate the total volume of oxygen consumed. The athlete consumes 3.0 L of oxygen per minute for 5 minutes, so the total volume is 3.0 L/min * 5 min = 15 L.
Next, we need to convert the volume of oxygen to moles. We can use the ideal gas law, but for this approximation, we can assume that the oxygen is at standard temperature and pressure (STP), where 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L. Therefore, 15 L of oxygen is equal to 15 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.67 mol.
Now, we can calculate the energy expended using the energy yield of aerobic respiration.  One mole of glucose can produce approximately 36 ATP molecules, and each ATP molecule yields about 30 kJ of energy.  Therefore, 0.67 mol of oxygen consumed can produce approximately 0.67 mol * 36 ATP/mol * 30 kJ/ATP = 750 kJ.
However, this calculation assumes complete oxidation of glucose, which is not always the case.  Therefore, the actual energy expended is likely lower.  Of the given choices, the closest answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
