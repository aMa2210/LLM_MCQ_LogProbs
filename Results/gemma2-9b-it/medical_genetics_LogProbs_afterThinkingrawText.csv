"Input: If the frequency of males affected with an X-linked recessive condition in a human population is .10 (one in ten), what will be the expected frequency of affected females? Choices: a) 0.01 b) 0.001 c) 0.02 d) 0.0001 
Output:
First, we need to understand that X-linked recessive conditions are more common in males because they only have one X chromosome. Females need two copies of the recessive allele to be affected.
Second, we know the frequency of affected males is 0.10. This means the frequency of the recessive allele on the X chromosome in the population is also 0.10.
Finally, to calculate the frequency of affected females, we need to consider the probability of a female inheriting two copies of the recessive allele. Since the frequency of the recessive allele is 0.10, the probability of a female inheriting one recessive allele is 0.10, and the probability of inheriting another is also 0.10. Therefore, the probability of a female being affected is 0.10 * 0.10 = 0.01.

"Input: The risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria is: Choices: a) 1% b) 10% c) 25% d) Almost 100% 
Output:
First, we need to understand that phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder. 
Second, we know that PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning a child needs to inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition.
Finally, since the mother has untreated PKU, she carries two copies of the mutated gene and will pass one to each of her children. If the father does not carry the mutated gene, the child will be a carrier like the mother. If the father also carries the mutated gene, the child will have PKU.  Therefore, the risk of abnormality in the child is almost 100% if the father is also a carrier.

Since each parent contributes one allele (version of a gene) to their offspring, the probability of a first cousin inheriting a specific allele from a grandparent is 1/2.  Since they have two grandparents in common, the probability of sharing at least one allele from each grandparent is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Output:
First, we need to understand what X-linked dominant inheritance means. It means the gene responsible for the trait is located on the X chromosome, and only one copy of the dominant allele is needed to express the trait.
Next, we need to consider the options. 
a) Parental consanguinity refers to mating between close relatives and is not specific to X-linked dominant inheritance.
b) Male to male transmission is not possible in X-linked inheritance because males only have one X chromosome.
c) Transmission only by females is incorrect because males with the dominant allele will also express the trait.

"Input: On average, how many fragments would a restriction enzyme which recognizes a specific 4 base sequence in DNA be expected to cleave a double-stranded bacteriophage with a genome size of 5,000 bp into? Choices: a) about 2 b) about 4 c) about 20 d) about 50 
Output:
First, we need to calculate the probability of finding the specific 4 base sequence in the DNA.  Since there are 4 bases (A, T, C, G), the probability of finding a specific sequence is (1/4)^4 = 1/256.
Next, we need to estimate the number of times this sequence would appear in the 5,000 bp genome.  We can do this by multiplying the genome size by the probability of finding the sequence: 5,000 bp * (1/256) = 19.53.
Since we are dealing with whole fragments, we round this number to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the restriction enzyme would be expected to cleave the bacteriophage genome into about 20 fragments.

"Input: Assuming that the level of glucose is low, a mutation in the repressor associated with the lac operon of E. coli which prevents binding of the repressor to lactose should result in:  Choices: a) constitutive expression of the lac operon genes b) lack of expression or reduced expression of the lac operon genes under all circumstances c) expression of the genes only when lactose is present d) expression of the genes only when lactose is absent 
Output:
First, we need to understand the role of the lac operon. It controls the expression of genes involved in lactose metabolism. 
Second, we need to know how the repressor protein works. In the absence of lactose, the repressor binds to the operator region of the lac operon, preventing transcription of the genes. When lactose is present, it binds to the repressor, causing a conformational change that prevents it from binding to the operator. This allows transcription of the genes.
Finally, we need to consider the effect of the mutation. If the mutation prevents the repressor from binding to lactose, the repressor will always be active, even in the presence of lactose. This means that the lac operon genes will not be expressed, even when lactose is present.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: In meiosis, recombination occurs in: Choices: a) Metaphase I. b) Prophase I. c) Metaphase II. d) Prophase II.

Output:
First, we need to understand what the inbreeding coefficient (F) represents. It measures the probability that two alleles at a locus in an individual are identical by descent, meaning they were inherited from a common ancestor.

Second, we need to consider the impact of increased inbreeding on heterozygosity. Heterozygosity refers to the presence of different alleles at a locus. Increased inbreeding leads to a higher probability of individuals inheriting the same alleles from both parents, thus reducing the likelihood of heterozygotes.

Finally, we can determine the correct answer. An increase in the inbreeding coefficient (F) directly results in a reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

Second, we need to consider the effects of mutations. Most mutations are either neutral or deleterious, meaning they have no effect or a negative effect on the organism. 
Finally, we need to consider the frequency of mutations. Most new mutations appear in heterozygotes, meaning they are present on only one copy of the chromosome. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: Twin studies in humans are useful because Choices: a) they allow genetic as opposed to environmental influences on variation in a trait to be estimated b) cloning of genes is facilitated by the presence of extra copies c) they allow improved expression of genes d) twins have a greater likelihood of being heterozygous 
Output:
First, we need to understand what twin studies are and what they aim to achieve. Twin studies involve comparing the similarities and differences between identical (monozygotic) and fraternal (dizygotic) twins.

Second, we need to consider the purpose of these studies. Twin studies are primarily used to investigate the relative contributions of genetics and environment to the variation in a particular trait.

Third, we need to analyze each of the provided choices in light of this purpose.

Choice (a) directly addresses the goal of twin studies by allowing researchers to estimate the influence of genes versus environment on trait variation.

The other choices are not directly related to the primary purpose of twin studies.


{'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Complete the following sentence. The Philadelphia chromosome: Choices: a) is an example of gene amplification. b) is a product of a reciprocal translocation. c) causes Burkitt's lymphoma. d) causes retinoblastoma. 
Output:
First, I need to understand what the Philadelphia chromosome is. It is a specific chromosomal abnormality found in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
Next, I need to consider the options and see which one accurately describes the Philadelphia chromosome.
Finally, I need to recall the genetic basis of CML and how it relates to chromosomal translocations.

{'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Enzyme assay can be used to identify carriers of: Choices: a) Cystic fibrosis. b) Fragile X syndrome. c) Oculocutaneous albinism. d) Tay-Sachs disease. 
Output:
First, I need to understand what an enzyme assay is. An enzyme assay measures the activity of a specific enzyme. 
Next, I need to consider which of the listed diseases are caused by enzyme deficiencies. 
Finally, I need to identify the disease that is specifically linked to an enzyme assay for carrier screening.

{'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A high blood ammonia level occurs in: Choices: a) galactosaemia. b) Hurler's syndrome. c) ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. d) phenylketonuria. 
Output:
First, I need to understand what causes high blood ammonia levels. High blood ammonia is a sign of a problem with the urea cycle, which is responsible for breaking down ammonia in the body.
Next, I need to consider the choices and see which ones are related to urea cycle disorders. Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is a well-known urea cycle disorder.
Finally, I can eliminate the other choices as they are not directly related to the urea cycle. Galactosaemia, Hurler's syndrome, and phenylketonuria are all metabolic disorders, but they do not primarily affect the urea cycle.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."
"Input: In genome-wide association studies, known SNPs explain ______ of the variation in body mass index despite the evidence of greater than 50% heritability from twin and family studies. Choices: a) only 5% b) less than 1% c) only 13% d) less than 2% 
Output:
First, we need to understand the context. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aim to identify genetic variants associated with specific traits. 
Second, we know that heritability estimates from twin and family studies suggest that over 50% of the variation in body mass index (BMI) is due to genetic factors.
Third, the question asks about the proportion of BMI variation explained by known SNPs identified through GWAS.  

Considering these points, the answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
"Input: Differential distribution of substances in the egg most typically results in: Choices: a) differences in gene expression which may establish a pattern in the embryo as the cells divide b) amplification of specific genes during development c) development of polyploid tissues d) loss of specific genes during development 
Output:
First, we need to understand what differential distribution means. It implies that substances are not evenly spread throughout the egg. 
Second, we need to consider how this uneven distribution could influence development.  
Third, we need to analyze the answer choices and see which one best fits the concept of differential distribution leading to developmental patterns.

{'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following conditions is not caused by a mutation in FGFR3? Choices: a) Achondroplasia b) Crouzon syndrome c) Thanatophoric dysplasia d) Waardenburg syndrome 
Output:
First, I need to understand what FGFR3 is. FGFR3 stands for Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3, a gene that plays a crucial role in bone development.
Next, I need to recall the conditions listed and their known genetic causes. Achondroplasia, Crouzon syndrome, and Thanatophoric dysplasia are all known to be caused by mutations in FGFR3.
Finally, I need to identify the condition that is not associated with FGFR3 mutations. Waardenburg syndrome is a disorder affecting pigmentation and hearing, and it is primarily caused by mutations in genes like PAX3 and MITF, not FGFR3.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}."
