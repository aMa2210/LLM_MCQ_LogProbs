No task is more urgent than that of preserving peace. Without peace our independence means little. The rehabilitation and upbuilding of our countries will have little meaning. Our revolutions will not be allowed to run their course. What can we do? We can do much! We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we! We, the peoples of Asia and Africa, 1.4 billion strong.

Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China
In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
The argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history? Choices: a) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other b) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era c) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E. d) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion 
Output:
First, we need to identify the main argument of the passage. The passage argues that the development and use of gunpowder weapons differed between Europe and China due to their respective military needs. 
Second, we need to analyze the answer choices and see which one best relates to the main argument. 
Third, we we can eliminate the choices that are not relevant to the argument. Choices (a), (c), and (d) are not directly related to the reasons behind the different development of gunpowder weapons in Europe and China.

The city of Ghana consists of two towns. One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani .

Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.

Both authors below were speaking of the French Revolution.
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal . . . that things in general were settled for ever.

Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive. But to be young was very heaven.
—The Prelude, by William Wordsworth
Dickens's and Wordsworth's differing views about the French Revolution can be described, respectively, by which of the following adjectives? Choices: a) Optimistic, encouraged b) Understanding, accepting c) Cynical, enthusiastic d) Sincere, resigned 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the tone and message of each excerpt.
Dickens's passage uses contrasting phrases like ""best of times, worst of times"" and ""age of wisdom, age of foolishness"" to depict a chaotic and paradoxical period. The emphasis on ""noisiest authorities"" insisting on ""superlative degree of comparison"" suggests a sense of exaggeration and skepticism towards the revolution's promises.
Wordsworth's excerpt, on the other hand, expresses a sense of joy and wonder (""Bliss was it"") at being alive during this transformative era. The phrase ""to be young was very heaven"" conveys a sense of youthful optimism and enthusiasm.
Second, I need to match these tones with the provided adjective choices.
Option (a) ""Optimistic, encouraged"" aligns with Wordsworth's view of the French Revolution as a time of hope and possibility.
Option (b) ""Understanding, accepting"" doesn't fully capture the contrasting perspectives presented.
Option (c) ""Cynical, enthusiastic"" partially reflects Dickens's skepticism but doesn't accurately describe Wordsworth's positive outlook.
Option (d) ""Sincere, resigned"" doesn't fit either author's tone.

Woman, wake up; the bell of reason is being heard throughout the whole universe; discover your rights. Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!

The independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same.

Which of the following observations about revolutions and gender is best supported by the first passage? Choices: a) Revolutionary progressivism does not always concern itself with gender equality. b) Women typically assume leadership roles during times of revolution. c) Women rarely support revolutions and therefore receive little benefit from them. d) Revolutionary movements are generally uninterested in women's rights. 
Output:
First, I need to analyze the content of the first passage. Olympe de Gouges expresses disappointment with the lack of progress for women after the French Revolution. 
Second, she highlights the continued discrimination and lack of opportunities for women despite the revolution's promises of liberty and equality. 
Third, this directly supports the idea that revolutionary progressivism does not always concern itself with gender equality.

""The question as to who, and what, is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels. Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.""
Walter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974
Which of the following best explains the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.? Choices: a) Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs. b) Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms. c) Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves. d) Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty. 
Output:
First, we need to understand the context of Walter Rodney's statement. He argues that European imperialism was responsible for Africa's underdevelopment, specifically by exploiting its resources and hindering its economic growth. 
Second, we need to consider the period 1450 to 1750 C.E., which coincides with the rise of the transatlantic slave trade. This trade significantly impacted Sub-Saharan Africa, leading to the displacement of millions of people and the disruption of social and economic structures.
Third, we need to analyze the answer choices in light of Rodney's argument and the historical context of the transatlantic slave trade.

It is also impossible to say that he who undertakes to carry out these revisions for himself transgresses a law, since the Versailles ""Diktat"" is not law to us. A signature was forced out of us with pistols at our head and with the threat of hunger for millions of people.

First, we need to understand the context of the Treaty of Versailles. It was the peace treaty that ended World War I and imposed harsh penalties on Germany, including territorial losses, disarmament, and heavy reparations.
Second, we need to analyze Hitler's statement in Source 1. He criticizes the Treaty of Versailles as being imposed on Germany by force and calls it ""not law to us."" This suggests that he believes Germany was unfairly treated and that the treaty was illegitimate.

In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.
British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860
Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.
Rudrangshu Mukherjee, ""The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,"" 1990
According to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre Choices: a) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms. b) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India. c) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression. d) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main argument of the second passage. The passage argues that the British rule in India was characterized by a monopoly of violence, which they used to maintain their dominance over the colonized population. 
Second, I need to analyze how the Cawnpore Massacre fits into this argument. The passage states that the revolt of 1857, including the Cawnpore Massacre, shattered this monopoly of violence by matching the official violence of the British with an indigenous violence of the colonized. 
Third, I need to determine which answer choice best reflects this analysis. The answer choice that best reflects this analysis is (b) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.

When a child gets 3s. a week, does that go much towards its subsistence?
—No, it will not keep it as it should do.
Why do you allow your children to go to work at those places where they are ill-treated or over-worked?
—Necessity compels a man that has children to let them work.
Then you would not allow your children to go to those factories under the present system, if it was not from necessity?
—No.
—Testimony given before the Sadler Committee, 1831–32
According to the passage, why does the witness allow his children to work in a place where they will be ill-treated? Choices: a) A factory owner is forcing him to do so. b) He doesn’t earn enough on his own. c) The children need discipline. d) Their labor is only moderately difficult.

Which best describes the relationship between the United States and the Soviets as depicted in the passage? Choices: a) Uneasy allies b) Comrades-in-arms c) Mortal enemies d) Distant strangers 
Output:
First, we need to identify the main conflict in the passage. The passage describes Colonel Bonesteel's dilemma in dividing Korea between American and Soviet forces. This suggests a tense relationship between the two superpowers.
Second, we need to analyze the language used to describe their interaction. The passage mentions that the Soviets were ""on the verge of moving into Korea"" and that the US would be ""unable to stop them"" if they refused to confine their advance. This language implies a power struggle and a lack of trust between the two nations.

Kwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961
Nkrumah's argument in the passage most clearly supports which of the following ideologies? Choices: a) Pan-Africanism b) Communism c) African socialism d) Neocolonialism 
Output:
First, we need to understand what each ideology stands for. Pan-Africanism is the idea of unity and solidarity among people of African descent. Communism is a political and economic system that advocates for a classless society. African socialism is a political ideology that emphasizes social justice and economic equality within Africa. Neocolonialism is the practice of using economic and political influence to control former colonies.
Next, we need to analyze Nkrumah's argument. He emphasizes the need for a political union of African states to project African personality and gain respect on the world stage. He criticizes the lack of attention paid to African concerns by the Great Powers and highlights the dangers of disunity.
Finally, we need to determine which ideology best aligns with Nkrumah's argument. His call for African unity and his criticism of Western powers' disregard for African interests strongly suggest that his argument supports Pan-Africanism.

""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

Output:
First, we need to understand the context of Mao's speech. He is concerned about the growing gap between rich and poor peasants in China, which he believes threatens the worker-peasant alliance. 
Second, we need to analyze the proposed solution: ""the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture."" This phrase suggests a fundamental change in the way agriculture is organized and operated.

I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on.
A soldier says simply: ""They call up more every day.
""Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
""But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.""

At the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. . . . The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.

This great purity of the French Revolution is precisely what causes both our strength and our weakness. Our strength, because it gives to us rights of the public interest over private interests; our weakness, because it rallies all vicious men against us. We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or perish with it; now in this situation, the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror. Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible; it is therefore an emanation of virtue; it is not so much a special principle as it is a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to our country's most urgent needs.

Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.

""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.
As we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women's liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation. In order to build this alliance, the brothers in gay liberation will have to be prepared to sacrifice that degree of male chauvinism and male privilege that they still all possess.""

In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.
British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860
Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.
Rudrangshu Mukherjee, ""The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,"" 1990

Output:
First, we need to understand the context of the passages. Both passages discuss the Cawnpore massacres during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. 
Second, we need to analyze the consequences of the rebellion mentioned in the passages. The passages highlight the violence and brutality on both sides, with the British emphasizing the threat to their authority and the Indians fighting for their freedom.
Third, we need to consider the historical outcome of the rebellion. The rebellion was ultimately suppressed by the British, leading to a change in the administration of India.

What is important
about Sharpeville
is not that seventy died:

retreating, unarmed, defenceless
and certainty not
the heavy caliber slug

On whom therefore is the labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering this territory incumbent, if not upon you? You, upon whom above other nations God has conferred remarkable glory in arms, great courage, bodily activity, and strength to humble the hairy scalp of those who resist you.
Let the deeds of your ancestors move you and incite your minds to manly achievements; the glory and greatness of king Charles the Great, and of his son Louis, and of your other kings, who have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans, and extended in these lands the territory of the holy church. Let the holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior, which is possessed by unclean nations, especially incite you, and the holy places which are now treated with ignominy and irreverently polluted with their filthiness.

He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.""

In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.
British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860
Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.

Although in Protestant Europe, [Peter the Great] was surrounded by evidence of the new civil and political rights of individual men embodied in constitutions, bills of rights and parliaments, he did not return to Russia determined to share power with his people. On the contrary, he returned not only determined to change his country but also convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force. He would try to lead; but where education and persuasion were not enough, he could drive—and if necessary flog—the backward nation forward.

""The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.
Firstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.
Secondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.
Thirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend that no one may call a council but the Pope…
…The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life. They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only.

First, I need to understand what the ""second wall"" refers to in the context of the passage. The author mentions three walls that the Romanists (Catholics) have built to protect themselves from reform. 
Second, I need to analyze the content of the second paragraph to see what specific argument Luther is making against the Romanists. He criticizes their claim to be the sole interpreters of the Scriptures, despite their lack of learning and their reliance on the Pope's authority.

Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.
Antonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potosí, 1620s
The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.
Heinrich von Füch, ""On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,"" 1744
According to the second passage, which of the following contributed most to the burden faced by native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations? Choices: a) Interference by Russian Orthodox missionaries b) Native inexperience in hunting deep into the subarctic tundra c) Competition from Russian hunters and trappers d) Overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals 
Output:
First, I need to identify the main problem faced by the native Siberians according to the passage. The passage states that they are ""ruined"" because of the yasak tribute.
Next, I need to analyze the factors mentioned in the passage that contribute to this burden. The passage lists several factors, including the depletion of furbearing animals, the lack of horses, and the need to pay tribute in various forms.
Finally, I need to determine which factor is most significant based on the information provided. The passage explicitly states that ""almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors."" This suggests that the lack of horses, directly linked to the yasak system, is the most significant contributor to their burden.

""To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten!

Which of the following reasons explains why European citizens moved in large numbers to Zulu lands in 1867? Choices: a) The British crown offered incentives to those who would establish homesteads in the unsettled lands of South Africa. b) The Zulu created attractive trade ports along the Indian Ocean. c) The Berlin Conference clarified boundaries, thus making it logistically sound for Europeans to move to the African colonies. d) A diamond rush ensued following the discovery of diamonds on Zulu lands. 
Output:
First, we need to understand the context of the letter. It was written during the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879. This means the events described happened before 1879.
Second, the letter mentions the writer suing the government for damages caused by a contingent of natives. This suggests conflict and tension between European settlers and the Zulu people.
Third, the letter states that the writer's homestead was insured for ￡2,000 and that he has a farm of 50 acres. This indicates that European citizens were already living and farming in the area before the war.

""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties.

And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China
In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
According to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry? Choices: a) They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so. b) They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces. c) They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs. d) They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology.

From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries.

Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (United States)
The passages are best seen as examples of which prominent social or economic trend from the 1800s? Choices: a) The rise of anti-Semitic ideologies b) Trade protectionism c) A growing desire to attract skilled labor from abroad d) Hardening of anti-immigrant sentiment 
Output:
First, we need to analyze the content of both passages. The Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 focuses on restricting immigration to Australia based on factors like language proficiency and potential to become a public charge. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 specifically targets Chinese laborers, prohibiting their entry and imposing penalties on those who bring them into the United States.

And Hormizd, King of Kings, conferred on me cap and belt and created for me a higher rank and dignity, and at court and in kingdom after kingdom, place after place, throughout the whole empire he gave me more authority and power in matters of the divine services, and created for me the title ""Kerdir, Ahura Mazda's [Chief Priest]"" after the name of Ahura Mazda, the Deity.

Excerpt from the inscription of Kerdir at Naqsh-e-Rustam, Persia, late third century C.E.
Which of the following best describes Persia's relationship with Arabia in the period 600–1450 C.E.? Choices: a) Persian armies were largely in control of Arabia throughout the period. b) Persia and Arabia interacted infrequently throughout the period. c) Persia supported Arabian client states throughout the period. d) Persia was brought into the Arabian orbit over the course of the period. 
Output:
First, we need to understand the context of the provided text. The text describes the rise of the Mazdayanian religion and the suppression of other religions during the reign of the Sasanian emperors in Persia. This information is relevant to understanding Persia's religious and political landscape but doesn't directly address its relationship with Arabia.
Second, we need to consider the historical context of Persia and Arabia between 600 and 1450 C.E. During this period, the Sasanian Empire declined, and the Islamic Caliphate rose to prominence, eventually conquering Persia. This suggests that the relationship between Persia and Arabia shifted significantly during this time.
Third, we need to analyze the answer choices in light of this historical context. Option (a) is unlikely because the Sasanian Empire, while powerful, did not have complete control over Arabia. Option (b) is also unlikely because there was some level of interaction between the two regions, particularly through trade. Option (c) is not supported by the historical evidence. Option (d) is the most accurate description of the relationship, as the rise of Islam led to Persia becoming part of the Arabian Islamic world.

""From the confines of Jerusalem and the city of Constantinople a horrible tale has gone forth and very frequently has been brought to our ears, namely, that a race from the kingdom of the Persians, an accursed race, a race utterly alienated from God, a generation forsooth which has not directed its heart and has not entrusted its spirit to God, has invaded the lands of those Christians and has depopulated them by the sword, pillage and fire; it has led away a part of the captives into its own country, and a part it has destroyed by cruel tortures; it has either entirely destroyed the churches of God or appropriated them for the rites of its own religion….The kingdom of the Greeks is now dismembered by them and deprived of territory so vast in extent that it cannot be traversed in a march of two months. On whom therefore is the labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering this territory incumbent, if not upon you? You, upon whom above other nations God has conferred remarkable glory in arms, great courage, bodily activity, and strength to humble the hairy scalp of those who resist you.
Let the deeds of your ancestors move you and incite your minds to manly achievements; the glory and greatness of king Charles the Great, and of his son Louis, and of your other kings, who have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans, and extended in these lands the territory of the holy church. Let the holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior, which is possessed by unclean nations, especially incite you, and the holy places which are now treated with ignominy and irreverently polluted with their filthiness. Oh, most valiant soldiers and descendants of invincible ancestors, be not degenerate, but recall the valor of your progenitors.

Pope Urban II, Speech at the Council of Clermont as recorded by Robert the Monk, 1095 C.E.
The speech above is best understood in context of which of the following? Choices: a) The Mongol invasions of the Middle East b) The Protestant Reformation c) The Age of Discovery d) The Crusades 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key themes in the speech. The speech talks about a ""race"" invading Christian lands, depopulating them, destroying churches, and holding Jerusalem captive. It calls for a holy war to avenge these wrongs and liberate Jerusalem.
Next, I need to consider the historical context of each choice. The Mongol invasions happened centuries after the speech, the Protestant Reformation was a religious movement within Christianity, and the Age of Discovery focused on exploration and colonization.
Finally, the Crusades were a series of religious wars sanctioned by the Latin Church in the medieval period with the primary goal of reclaiming the Holy Land from Muslim rule. The themes of the speech align perfectly with the Crusades.

I have, in conformity without resolve, put together some few points concerning the reformation of the Christian estate, with the intent of placing the same before the Christian nobility of the German nation. . . . It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called ""cardinals""? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.

Which of the following reformers expressed views similar to those expressed by Martin Luther in his letter above? Choices: a) Ulrich Zwingli b) Sir Thomas More c) Erasmus d) John Wycliffe 
Output:
First, we need to identify the main points of Luther's argument. He criticizes the Pope's power, the corruption within the Church, and the focus on worldly possessions over spiritual matters.
Second, we need to consider which reformer shared similar views.  Luther's criticisms align with the ideas of John Wycliffe, who also challenged papal authority and advocated for a simpler, more Bible-centered Church.
Finally, we can eliminate the other options. Ulrich Zwingli focused primarily on theological issues, Sir Thomas More was a staunch defender of the Catholic Church, and Erasmus, while critical of some Church practices, did not advocate for radical reform.

When the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.""
Ralph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.
The description in the second paragraph of the procedures that Portuguese and other foreigners followed when trading in China supports which of the following inferences about trade policy in the later Ming Dynasty? Choices: a) The Ming Dynasty was very supportive of and welcoming to all commercial enterprise. b) The Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly to limit contact with foreigners and ease collection of taxes. c) The Ming Dynasty was too busy battling pirates along its coast to pay any attention to regular merchant activity. d) The Ming Dynasty only allowed Portugal to trade with China through Canton, permitting only one boat a year. 
Output:
First, we need to identify the key details about the trade procedures described in the passage. The Portuguese had to register their names upon arrival and departure, were restricted to staying in their boats at night, and had a limited time to trade. 
Second, we need to consider what these restrictions imply about the Ming Dynasty's attitude towards trade. The strict regulations suggest a desire to control and monitor foreign trade. 
Finally, we need to choose the answer choice that best reflects this inference. Option b) states that the Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly to limit contact with foreigners and ease collection of taxes, which aligns with the details provided in the passage.

We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind.

""In Northern India the existence of separate States at this period is usually little more than a question of words. A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.""
W.H. Moreland, India at the Death of Akbar, 1920
Zamindars had an ability ""to establish a claim to sovereignty"" largely due to the Mughal Empire's policy of Choices: a) religious toleration b) universal taxation c) martial law d) suffrage 
Output:
First, we need to understand what the passage says about zamindars and their relationship to the Mughal Empire. 
Second, we need to identify the policy of the Mughal Empire that would allow zamindars to ""establish a claim to sovereignty.""
Third, we need to analyze the choices provided and determine which one aligns with the passage's description.

The passage states that zamindars who paid revenue to the Mughals were in a position of dependence. To establish sovereignty, they needed to refuse or omit paying revenue. This suggests that the Mughal policy allowed for a degree of autonomy or control over revenue collection, which zamindars could leverage to assert their independence.

Of the choices provided, the one that best fits this description is **b) universal taxation**.  Universal taxation implies a system where everyone pays taxes, but it doesn't necessarily mean the Mughal Empire had complete control over every aspect of revenue collection. Zamindars could potentially use their control over local revenue to challenge Mughal authority.

Secondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.

First, we need to understand the context of the passage. Martin Luther is criticizing the Roman Catholic Church and its practices. 
Second, we need to look at the sentence where ""temporal power"" is mentioned: ""Firstly, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them..."" This sentence suggests that the ""temporal power"" is something external to the Church, something that is trying to exert control over it.

""When the gods fashioned Gilgamesh*, to him they gave a perfect form. The glorious sun Shamash bestowed upon him glory; Adad the terrible god of storms bestowed upon him courage. The great gods perfected his magnificence beyond all others, terrible like the great wild bull. Two thirds god they made him; one third man they made him.
Of Uruk, its great rampart he built, and the wall of the sacred Eanna temple, the holy sanctuary. Behold the outer walls which gleam with the brilliance of copper; see the inner wall which none might rival. Touch the threshold stone—it is from ancient days. Goest thou into the Eanna temple, yea, the dwelling place of Ishtar, the like of which no subsequent king or living man might equal. Ascend and walk about on the wall of Uruk, inspect the corner-stone, and examine its brick-work, whether its wall is not made of burned brick, and its foundation laid by the Seven Sages. One third for city, one third for garden, one third for field, and a precinct for the temple of Ishtar. These parts and the precinct comprise Uruk.""

I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on.
A soldier says simply: ""They call up more every day.
""Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
""But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.""

Option (a) suggests a strong bureaucracy at the local level, which is implied by the District Officers demanding tax. 
Option (b) talks about a large standing army, which is mentioned in the poem but not directly related to taxation.
Option (c) discusses agricultural technologies, which are mentioned in the context of the Shanxi men's inability to farm due to military service, but not directly related to taxation.

But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.

1. The excessive growth and prosperity of the empire, which led to internal decay and instability.
2. The military's decline in discipline and effectiveness due to corruption and reliance on foreign mercenaries.
3. The emperors' increasing reliance on corrupt practices to maintain control, weakening the empire's foundations.
4. The influx of barbarian invasions, exploiting the empire's weakened state.

Next, we need to consider which other classical empires shared these characteristics. 

Finally, we need to evaluate the answer choices and determine which best aligns with the identified reasons for Rome's fall.

Excerpt from the inscription of Kerdir at Naqsh-e-Rustam, Persia, late third century C.E.
The source best supports which of the following inferences about sources of political authority in the period circa 600 B.C.E.–600 C.E.? Choices: a) Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule by their sponsorship of religion and chief priests. b) Rulers were limited in their political authority by powerful religious figures. c) Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule through victories over foreign peoples. d) Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule through the consent of those they governed. 
Output:
First, we need to analyze the excerpt and understand the relationship between the rulers and the religious figures. The text states that the kings conferred authority and power on Kerdir, the chief priest, for divine services. 

Second, we need to consider the implications of this relationship. The kings seem to be using their power to elevate the religious figures and their influence. This suggests that the kings recognized the importance of religion in maintaining their legitimacy.

Third, we need to evaluate the answer choices in light of our analysis. Option (a) aligns with the text's description of rulers using religious sponsorship to legitimize their rule.

He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.""

And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.
And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines….And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]…at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.
There is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him….Even the protector of the Indians is useless;…he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.""

The views expressed in the passage are best seen as evidence for which of the following in the society of Spanish South America? Choices: a) The formal adoption of debt slavery as a means to clear debts b) The absence of corruption among elites c) The king's lack of interest in the welfare of Native American subjects d) The imposition of social stratification based on origin of birth 
Output:
First, we need to understand the main argument of the passage. Guaman Poma de Ayala is describing the harsh treatment of Native Americans in the silver mines of Spanish South America. 

Second, we need to identify the specific examples he provides to support his argument. He talks about forced labor, lack of pay, exploitation, and corruption among the mine owners and officials.

Third, we need to consider which of the answer choices best reflects these examples.  The passage clearly shows that the Spanish elites were corrupt and exploited the Native Americans for their own gain. This points to answer choice c) as the best fit.

Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.
Antonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potosí, 1620s
The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.

""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

""The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression. This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.
As we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women's liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation.

At the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. . . . The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.

Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.
William Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, ""On the Suppression of Sati,"" 1829
I have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].

Choices: a) Direct rule by the crown b) Complete privatization of colonial authority c) Martial law enforced by sizable armies d) The chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits 
Output:
First, we need to identify the key themes in each passage.
The first passage by William Bentinck focuses on the moral dilemma of suppressing the practice of sati in India, highlighting the conflict between humanitarian concerns and the perceived need to maintain order and stability within the British Empire.
The second passage by George Simpson emphasizes the need for strict control and economic dependence of indigenous populations in the fur trade. He advocates for using economic leverage to maintain subordination and control.
Second, we need to consider the colonial techniques commonly used by Western imperial powers and how they relate to the themes in the passages.
Options (a) and (c) involve direct military control and enforcement, which are not explicitly mentioned in either passage.
Option (b) suggests complete privatization of colonial authority, which is also not supported by the passages.
Option (d) aligns with the themes of economic control and the use of chartered companies to manage colonial territories, as seen in Simpson's emphasis on the Hudson's Bay Company's role in the fur trade.

The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.

There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,

Purusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.
It was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.
When they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.

Questions to the passage below, an account given to a French officer in Algeria in the 1830s by a member of an Arab slave trade caravan.
The Slave Trade
All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""]. . . . The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries
A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.
Which statement best supports the argument that religion played a role in the Arab slave trade? Choices: a) Seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields b) With orders to attack places without defenses c) Four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women d) All of you soldiers, are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes 
Output:
First, I need to identify the statement that mentions religion. 
The statement that mentions religion is: ""All of you soldiers, are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes"".
Second, I need to understand the context of the statement. 
The statement refers to the Koholanes as ""idolatrous"", which implies that their religious beliefs are considered wrong or inferior by the speaker.
Third, I need to determine if the statement supports the argument that religion played a role in the Arab slave trade. 
The statement suggests that the religious beliefs of the Koholanes were a justification for their enslavement.

A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.""

Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.
William Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, ""On the Suppression of Sati,"" 1829
I have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].

The first passage can be said to undermine which commonly held assumption about Western imperialism? Choices: a) That European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices b) That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits c) That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations d) That European colonizers often resorted to armed force to impose their will on imperial subjects

""To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak––therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved.

Joseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931
Stalin's speech is most strongly influenced by which of the following? Choices: a) Appeasement b) Fascism c) Communism d) Secret treaties 
Output:
First, we need to analyze the main themes of Stalin's speech. The speech emphasizes the need for Russia to catch up and surpass other nations, highlighting the dangers of falling behind. It also criticizes Russia's past weakness and vulnerability to exploitation by stronger powers.
Second, we need to consider the historical context of Stalin's speech. It was delivered in 1931, during the early years of the Soviet Union. This period was marked by rapid industrialization and collectivization, as Stalin sought to transform Russia into a powerful industrial nation.
Third, we need to evaluate how each of the answer choices aligns with the themes and context of the speech. Appeasement is a policy of making concessions to an aggressor to avoid war, which is not relevant to Stalin's message. Fascism is an authoritarian ideology that emphasizes nationalism, militarism, and the suppression of opposition, which shares some similarities with Stalin's rhetoric but is not the primary influence. Secret treaties are agreements between nations that are kept secret, which are not a central theme in the speech.
Communism, on the other hand, is a political and economic system that advocates for the abolition of private property and the establishment of a classless society. Stalin's speech clearly reflects communist ideology, particularly its emphasis on economic development, social equality, and the struggle against capitalist exploitation.

""From the confines of Jerusalem and the city of Constantinople a horrible tale has gone forth and very frequently has been brought to our ears, namely, that a race from the kingdom of the Persians, an accursed race, a race utterly alienated from God, a generation forsooth which has not directed its heart and has not entrusted its spirit to God, has invaded the lands of those Christians and has depopulated them by the sword, pillage and fire; it has led away a part of the captives into its own country, and a part it has destroyed by cruel tortures; it has either entirely destroyed the churches of God or appropriated them for the rites of its own religion….The kingdom of the Greeks is now dismembered by them and deprived of territory so vast in extent that it cannot be traversed in a march of two months.

Which style of government is most associated with limited regulations on business and working conditions similar to those described in the passage? Choices: a) Laissez-faire b) Totalitarian c) Utilitarian d) Corporatist 
Output:
First, we need to understand the context of the passage. It describes a worker who is struggling to make ends meet and is forced to send his children to work in dangerous and exploitative conditions. This suggests a lack of government intervention in the labor market.
Next, we need to consider the different styles of government and their typical approaches to business and working conditions.
Laissez-faire capitalism is characterized by minimal government intervention in the economy, allowing businesses to operate with limited regulations. This aligns with the situation described in the passage, where workers have few protections and are subject to exploitation.
The other options are not as relevant. Totalitarian regimes typically have strong government control over all aspects of society, including the economy. Utilitarian philosophy focuses on maximizing overall happiness, but it doesn't necessarily imply limited regulations. Corporatism involves collaboration between government, business, and labor unions, which would likely lead to more regulations.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.

Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible; it is therefore an emanation of virtue; it is not so much a special principle as it is a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to our country's most urgent needs.
French revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre, 1794
The passage above appears to articulate which of the following political principles? Choices: a) From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs b) Might makes right c) The end justifies the means d) The government is best that governs least 
Output:
First, we need to analyze the core message of the passage. Robespierre emphasizes the need for a strong government to protect the ""public interest"" and suppress ""enemies"" of the Republic. 
Second, he argues that ""terror"" is a necessary tool for achieving this goal, justifying it as ""justice, prompt, severe, inflexible"" and a consequence of the ""general principle of democracy.""
Third, considering these points, the political principle most closely aligned with Robespierre's argument is ""The end justifies the means.""

""Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.""

The political philosophy espoused in the text above is different from those of the medieval period in which of the following ways? Choices: a) It accepted the notion that monarchs were justified in asserting their authority. b) It was a pragmatic rather than an ethical or religious ideology. c) It stressed the importance of looking back to the classical past. d) It did not rely upon strong concepts of equality across class boundaries. 
Output:
First, we need to understand the core message of Machiavelli's text. It emphasizes the importance of a ruler's power and the need to be feared rather than loved. This is a pragmatic approach focused on maintaining control and stability.

Second, we need to compare this to the political philosophies of the medieval period. Medieval thought was heavily influenced by religious and ethical considerations, often emphasizing the divine right of kings and the importance of justice and mercy.

Third, considering these points, the most significant difference is that Machiavelli's philosophy is pragmatic and focused on power, while medieval thought was more ethical and religious in nature.

""Purusa-Sukta""
Purusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.
It was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.
When they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.

They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.

Maulana Mohamed AH was arrested at Waltair under sections 107 and 108 to be called upon to give security, to be of good behaviour for one year. The place and date of trial is unknown.
The Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.

There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.
I hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.
By striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.
Let us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal.""

Non-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments…The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.""

Thus our position is most extraordinary and complicated. But there is more. As our role has always been strictly passive and political existence nil, we find that our quest for liberty is now even more difficult of accomplishment; for we, having been placed in a state lower than slavery, had been robbed not only of our freedom but also of the right to exercise an active domestic tyranny…We have been ruled more by deceit than by force, and we have been degraded more by vice than by superstition. Slavery is the daughter of darkness: an ignorant people is a blind instrument of its own destruction. Ambition and intrigue abuses the credulity and experience of men lacking all political, economic, and civic knowledge; they adopt pure illusion as reality; they take license for liberty, treachery for patriotism, and vengeance for justice. If a people, perverted by their training, succeed in achieving their liberty, they will soon lose it, for it would be of no avail to endeavor to explain to them that happiness consists in the practice of virtue; that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of tyrants, because, as the laws are more inflexible, every one should submit to their beneficent austerity; that proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law; and that to practice justice is to practice liberty.""

This whole city is surrounded by a wall: each of the six [districts of Hangzhou] is also surrounded by a wall. In the first reside the guards, with their commander. I was told that, in the muster-rolls, these amount to twelve thousand…In the second division are the Jews, Christians, and the Turks who worship the sun: these are numerous, their number is not known: and theirs is the most beautiful city.

There are in the city a great number of [Muslims], with some of whom I resided for fifteen days; and was treated most [honorably]…""

The observations expressed in the excerpt are best seen as evidence for which of the following in Yuan China? Choices: a) Policies of religious toleration b) Instatement of foreigners as provincial administrators c) Mongol assimilation into Chinese culture d) Military pressures from internal unrest 
Output:
First, we need to identify the key themes in the excerpt. Ibn Battuta highlights the presence of diverse religious communities, including Muslims, Jews, Christians, and sun worshippers, within Hangzhou. He also mentions the significant number of Muslims in the city and their well-established community with mosques and colleges.
Second, we need to consider the context of Yuan China. The Yuan dynasty was founded by Kublai Khan, a Mongol ruler who conquered China in the 13th century. 
Third, we need to analyze the choices and determine which best aligns with the observations in the excerpt. 
Option (a) ""Policies of religious toleration"" is the most fitting choice because Ibn Battuta's account describes the coexistence of various religious groups within Hangzhou, suggesting a degree of religious freedom under the Yuan dynasty.

""The greatest contribution that Africa can make to the peace of the world is to avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity, by creating a political union which will also by its success, stand as an example to a divided world. A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.""

To their narrative, which they gave in the regular order of events, and delivered in perspicuous language, he listened with attentive silence. The letters and the presents from pope Gregory were then laid before him, and, upon hearing the former read, he bestowed much commendation on the fidelity, the zeal, and the diligence of his ambassadors; and receiving with due reverence the oil from the holy sepulchre, he gave directions that it should be preserved with religious care. Upon his observing Marco Polo, and inquiring who he was, Nicolo made answer, This is your servant, and my son; upon which the grand Khan replied, ""He is welcome, and it pleases me much,"" and he caused him to be enrolled amongst his attendants of honor. And on account of their return he made a great feast and rejoicing; and as long as the said brothers and Marco remained in the court of the grand Khan, they were honored even above his own courtiers.

""The quicksilver mines of Huancavelica are where the poor Indians are so harshly punished, where they are tortured and so many Indians die; it is there that the noble caciques [headmen] of this kingdom are finished off and tortured. The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]….The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year….
And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.
And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines….And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]…at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.

Which of the following changes to the Spanish policies towards Native Americans occurred on account of the practices described in the passage? Choices: a) The replacement of native laborers in the mines with an almost exclusively African slave workforce b) The foundation of viceroyalties to allow for more effective royal administration of native relations c) The promulgation of royal decrees insisting on more humane treatment of the natives d) The enfranchisement of all natives by local Spanish elites in the colonies 
Output:
First, we need to identify the main issues raised in the passage. The passage describes the brutal treatment of Native Americans in the silver mines, including forced labor, torture, lack of pay, and sexual exploitation. 
Second, we need to consider the potential consequences of these practices. The passage explicitly states that these practices leave the Native Americans impoverished and unable to pay their tribute. This suggests that the Spanish policies were not sustainable in the long run and likely led to unrest and resistance.
Third, we need to analyze the answer choices in light of the passage's content.  The passage describes the corruption of colonial officials and the ineffectiveness of existing safeguards for Native Americans. This suggests that the Spanish crown was aware of the problems but failed to address them effectively.

That day the Reverend Xuanzang was chosen from among all the monks. He had been a monk from infancy, and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitions. His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know.
…
He looked to the West and prayed, ""I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures. If I am fated to have a disciple, may I be able to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King to come with me to the Vulture Peak. If I am not fated to have a disciple, and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good, then may I be unable to remove the seal."" When he had prayed he bowed again.

Output:
First, we need to understand how the excerpt portrays Xuanzang. It depicts him as a devout monk who seeks to retrieve scriptures from the West and prays for a disciple, the Monkey King.
Second, we need to consider how this portrayal might complicate historians' understanding of Xuanzang. The excerpt introduces a fantastical element with the Monkey King, a figure not historically documented as accompanying Xuanzang.

""Purusa-Sukta""
Purusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.
It was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.
When they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.

Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.""

The following poem refers to an incident in Sharpeville, South Africa, in 1960. To protest the requirement that they carry papers documenting their identity and residence, black South Africans gathered in front of police stations without their papers. Though other protests ended peacefully, in Sharpeville, police fired into the crowd.
What is important
about Sharpeville
is not that seventy died:
nor even that they were shot in the back
retreating, unarmed, defenceless
and certainty not
the heavy caliber slug
that tore through a mother's back
and ripped through the child in her arms
killing it
Remember Sharpeville
bullet-in-the-back day
Because it epitomized oppression
and the nature of society
More clearly than anything else;
it was the classic event
Nowhere is racial dominance
more clearly defined
nowhere the will to oppress
more clearly demonstrated
What the world whispers
apartheid declares with snarling guns
the blood the rich lust after
South Africa spills dust
Remember Sharpeville
Remember bullet-in-the-back day
And remember the unquenchable will for freedom
Remember the dead
and be glad

Choices: a) The world is too afraid of South Africa to oppose apartheid. b) The world engages in subtler forms of discrimination. c) The world condemns South Africa’s discrimination. d) The world economy promotes South Africa’s discrimination. 
Output:
First, we need to understand the context of the poem. The poem talks about the Sharpeville massacre, a brutal event where police opened fire on unarmed black protesters. The poet uses this event to highlight the nature of apartheid and the oppression faced by black South Africans.
Next, we need to analyze the phrase ""what the world whispers."" The poem contrasts this with ""apartheid declares with snarling guns."" This suggests that the world's response to apartheid is not as direct or forceful as South Africa's actions.

Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . .

Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy.

Seizing me, he led me down to the House of Darkness…
To the house where those who enter do not come out,

There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them.

And more than that-shame and dismay

So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go

""Poor Winter King,"" seventeenth-century song
The narrator of the song would most likely identify as which of the following? Choices: a) Roman Catholic b) Eastern Orthodox c) Protestant d) Muslim 
Output:
First, we need to understand the context of the song. The song refers to the ""Kaiser"" and ""Bohemia,"" which are related to the Holy Roman Empire and its history. 
Second, we need to consider the religious implications. The song mentions ""Ferdinand"" as the ""lawful king"" of Bohemia, and the narrator urges the ""Winter King"" to beg for pardon from him. This suggests a strong connection to the Catholic Church, as Ferdinand was a Catholic ruler.
Finally, we can deduce the narrator's likely religious affiliation. Given the context and the emphasis on Ferdinand's legitimacy as a Catholic king, the narrator is most likely a Roman Catholic.

""The quicksilver mines of Huancavelica are where the poor Indians are so harshly punished, where they are tortured and so many Indians die; it is there that the noble caciques [headmen] of this kingdom are finished off and tortured. The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]….The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year….
And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.
And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines….And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]…at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.

She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense.

""From the confines of Jerusalem and the city of Constantinople a horrible tale has gone forth and very frequently has been brought to our ears, namely, that a race from the kingdom of the Persians, an accursed race, a race utterly alienated from God, a generation forsooth which has not directed its heart and has not entrusted its spirit to God, has invaded the lands of those Christians and has depopulated them by the sword, pillage and fire; it has led away a part of the captives into its own country, and a part it has destroyed by cruel tortures; it has either entirely destroyed the churches of God or appropriated them for the rites of its own religion….The kingdom of the Greeks is now dismembered by them and deprived of territory so vast in extent that it cannot be traversed in a march of two months. On whom therefore is the labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering this territory incumbent, if not upon you? You, upon whom above other nations God has conferred remarkable glory in arms, great courage, bodily activity, and strength to humble the hairy scalp of those who resist you.
Let the deeds of your ancestors move you and incite your minds to manly achievements; the glory and greatness of king Charles the Great, and of his son Louis, and of your other kings, who have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans, and extended in these lands the territory of the holy church. Let the holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior, which is possessed by unclean nations, especially incite you, and the holy places which are now treated with ignominy and irreverently polluted with their filthiness. Oh, most valiant soldiers and descendants of invincible ancestors, be not degenerate, but recall the valor of your progenitors.
Jerusalem is the navel of the world; the land is fruitful above others, like another paradise of delights.

She seeks therefore and desires to be liberated and does not cease to implore you to come to her aid.

In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.
British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860
Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.
Rudrangshu Mukherjee, ""The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,"" 1990
From the perspective of the first passage, the death of British citizens at Cawnpore Choices: a) seems to mark a betrayal of a ""higher"" race by a ""lesser"" race. b) should be seen as a regrettable but avoidable mistake. c) can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves. d) was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty. 
Output:
First, we need to understand the perspective of the first passage. It is written by a British journalist who witnessed the Cawnpore massacres. 
Second, we need to analyze the language used in the passage. The author refers to the Indian rebels as a ""subject race"" and ""black men"" who ""dared to shed the blood of their masters."" This language clearly indicates a belief in the superiority of the British race.
Third, we need to consider the context of the passage. The author describes the Cawnpore massacres as a ""war of race"" and a ""war of revenge."" This suggests that the author sees the killings as a deliberate act of violence against the British because of their race and their position of power.

Questions to the passage below, an account given to a French officer in Algeria in the 1830s by a member of an Arab slave trade caravan.
The Slave Trade
All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""]. . . . The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries
A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.
How was the Arab trade in Africans different from the Atlantic slave trade? Choices: a) Unlike Arab slave merchants, those involved in the Atlantic slave trade were motivated by religion. b) Slaves taken for the Atlantic slave trade had no prospect of eventual liberty, but slaves taken by Arab merchants did. c) Slaves taken for the Atlantic trade were predominantly female; slaves taken by Arab merchants were mostly male. d) Slaves taken by Arab merchants were likely to have a shorter life span than those taken for the Atlantic trade. 
Output:
First, we need to analyze the provided text to understand the Arab slave trade practices. The text describes the capture, purchase, and transportation of African slaves by Arab merchants. It highlights the brutal treatment they endured, including whippings and forced marches.
Next, we need to compare these practices with the Atlantic slave trade, which is known for its transatlantic voyages, large-scale plantations, and the dehumanization of enslaved Africans.
Finally, we need to evaluate the answer choices in light of our understanding of both slave trades.

Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.

The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.

Which of the following factors, not mentioned in the second passage, would have been most likely to create added difficulties for native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations? Choices: a) The arrival of rival hunters from China and Japan b) The impact of epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers c) The general warming of the climate during this time period d) The reduced demand for furs among European and Asian elites 
Output:
First, we need to identify the main problem faced by the native Siberians according to the passage. The passage states that they are struggling to fulfill their yasak tribute obligations due to the depletion of fur-bearing animals and the loss of horses.
Second, we need to analyze each choice and determine which one would exacerbate this problem. 
a) The arrival of rival hunters from China and Japan would likely increase competition for remaining fur-bearing animals, making it harder for natives to fulfill their obligations.
b) The impact of epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers would likely reduce the native population, further decreasing the number of people available to hunt and gather furs.
c) The general warming of the climate during this time period could potentially impact the habitats of fur-bearing animals, making them harder to find and hunt.
d) The reduced demand for furs among European and Asian elites would likely decrease the value of the furs the natives could offer as tribute, making it harder to meet the required amount.

Therefore, the most likely factor to create added difficulties is {'sol': 'a'}."

At the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. . . . The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries.

The second passage undermines traditional historical assumptions by Choices: a) showing that state-level antagonisms in the Middle East during the crusading era were not always reflected in personal or economic life. b) showing how Middle Eastern Muslims during the crusading era did not take religious obligations as seriously as Christians did. c) showing how Muslims were on the whole kinder than Christians in the Middle East during the crusading era. d) showing how, in the Middle East during the crusading era, economic factors trumped all other considerations. 
Output:
First, let's analyze the second passage. It describes instances of kindness and tolerance shown by Muslims towards Christians, specifically mentioning the sharing of food with Muslim hermits and the unimpeded passage of Christian merchants.
Second, consider the context of the passage. It is contrasting this personal and economic interaction with the broader historical narrative of the Crusades, which is often characterized by conflict and antagonism between Christians and Muslims.
Third, the passage challenges the traditional assumption that the Crusades represented a period of constant warfare and hostility between the two religions. By highlighting instances of peaceful coexistence and cooperation, it suggests that the relationship between Christians and Muslims was more complex and nuanced than often portrayed.

""In Northern India the existence of separate States at this period is usually little more than a question of words. A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.""
W.H. Moreland, India at the Death of Akbar, 1920
Moreland's description of revenue collection in the Mughal Empire is best seen as evidence for which of the following generalizations? Choices: a) Only people of certain religions were required to pay revenue to the empire. b) Geographical differences may have influenced which groups pay taxes. c) Revenue collection was the only source of funds by which the Mughal Empire operated. d) The case of Rajputana was a typical one in the Mughal Empire. 
Output:
First, I need to identify the key point of the passage. The passage focuses on the ambiguity surrounding the relationship between zamindars and the Mughal Empire, particularly regarding revenue payment. 
Second, I need to analyze how this ambiguity relates to the answer choices.  
Third, I need to determine which answer choice best reflects the passage's main point. 

The passage highlights that revenue payment wasn't always a clear indicator of political allegiance or control.  This suggests that geographical differences likely influenced tax collection practices.

By what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land!

First, we need to understand the main argument of the passage. Lin Zexu is criticizing the British for their trade practices, specifically the opium trade. He argues that the British are knowingly selling a harmful drug to China, despite knowing its dangers. 
Second, we need to consider the historical context. The passage was written in 1839, during a period of increasing tension between China and Britain over trade. 
Third, we need to analyze the answer choices.  
a) Europe's enslavement of Chinese citizens - This is not mentioned in the passage.
b) Europe's expansion of missionary activity in China - While missionary activity was a factor in European-Chinese relations, it is not the central focus of this passage.
c) Europe's economic domination of China - This aligns with the passage's argument about the British exploiting China through the opium trade.

He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits.

Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.

In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him.

There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them.

""MAHATMA GANDHI'S MESSAGE.
REMAIN NON-VIOLENT
The following message was sent by Mahatma Gandhi from Waltair:—
Maulana Mohamed AH was arrested at Waltair under sections 107 and 108 to be called upon to give security, to be of good behaviour for one year. The place and date of trial is unknown.
The Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.
He and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.
I hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.
By striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.
Let us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal.""

And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines.

The Slave Trade
All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""]. . . . The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries
A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.
Which conclusion is supported by the passage? Choices: a) Africans passively accepted their capture and subsequent enslavement. b) North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes. c) Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women. d) Adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength.

The knowledge of anything, since all things have causes, is not acquired or complete unless it is known by its causes. Therefore in medicine we ought to know the causes of sickness and health. And because health and sickness and their causes are sometimes manifest, and sometimes hidden and not to be comprehended except by the study of symptoms, we must also study the symptoms of health and disease. Now it is established in the sciences that no knowledge is acquired save through the study of its causes and beginnings, if it has had causes and beginnings; nor completed except by knowledge of its accidents and accompanying essentials.""

Output:
First, we need to identify the key ideas presented in each passage.
Source 1 focuses on a practical, hands-on approach to treating a specific injury (a broken thigh). It describes the steps involved in setting the bone using ligatures and cords.
Source 2 discusses a more theoretical approach to medicine, emphasizing the importance of understanding the causes of health and disease. It highlights the need to study both symptoms and underlying causes.
Second, we need to consider the historical context of the passages. Paul of Aegina was a Byzantine physician writing in the late 7th century, while Ibn Sina (Avicenna) was an Islamic physician writing in the early 11th century.
Third, we need to analyze the potential cultural exchanges that occurred between 600 and 1450 C.E. and see which one best aligns with the information presented in the passages.

The influence of Greek science on Europeans through Byzantine and Islamic scholars is a well-documented cultural exchange that took place during this period.

One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak––therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty––therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.
That is why we must no longer lag behind.""
Joseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931
Stalin's efforts to advance Russia as justified by his mention of the ""continual beatings"" were vindicated by which of the following historical events? Choices: a) The Space Race with the United States b) The Polish-Soviet War in the early 1920s c) The Western intervention in the Russian Civil War d) The German invasion of Russia in 1941 
Output:
First, we need to understand the context of Stalin's speech. He argues that Russia was historically ""beaten"" by other nations because of its backwardness. He then emphasizes the need for Russia to catch up and no longer be vulnerable.
Next, we need to consider the historical events listed and determine which one best exemplifies Russia's advancement and overcoming its historical vulnerability.
Finally, we need to analyze the choices and see which one aligns with Stalin's argument about Russia's need to avoid being ""beaten"" by other nations.

Decree of the Second Council of Nicaea, 787 C.E.
Which of the following religious movements was ideologically opposed to the sentiments about the use of holy images reflected in the passages? Choices: a) Sunni Islam b) Buddhism c) Zoroastrianism d) Jainism 
Output:
First, we need to understand the main argument presented in both sources. Both John of Damascus and the Second Council of Nicaea defend the use of holy images in religious practice, arguing that they are a valuable tool for understanding and communicating religious truths, especially the incarnation of Christ.
Next, we need to consider which religious movement would be ideologically opposed to this view.  
Finally, we need to analyze the options provided.  Sunni Islam, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, and Jainism all have distinct beliefs and practices regarding religious imagery. Of these, Sunni Islam is known for its strict prohibition against the depiction of any living beings, including humans and animals, in religious art. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

Excerpt from the inscription of Kerdir at Naqsh-e-Rustam, Persia, late third century C.E.
Which of the following best explains the presence of Buddhist communities within Sassanid Persia? Choices: a) Persian efforts to convert people away from Buddhism inspired further followers. b) Buddhism's apocalyptic message swayed converts in Persia. c) Persia's location sat astride international trade routes with India. d) Buddhists were granted limited toleration by Zoroastrians. 
Output:
First, we need to understand the context of the passage. It describes the rise of Kerdir, a high priest in the Sassanid Persian empire, and the flourishing of Zoroastrianism under his patronage. 
Second, the passage mentions the presence of various other religions, including Buddhism, within the empire. This suggests that these religions were not actively suppressed but rather coexisted with Zoroastrianism.
Third, considering the historical context, option c) is the most plausible explanation. Persia's location on major trade routes connecting India, the birthplace of Buddhism, with the West would have facilitated the spread of Buddhist communities into the region.

The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.""

Based on the speech, the French saw Africa as which of the following? Choices: a) A collection of republics tottering into anarchy b) A resource for enhancing French power in the Cold War c) Important due to the Sahara's natural resources d) A strong political union 
Output:
First, we need to identify the main point of the speech. Nkrumah argues that Africa needs to unite to gain respect and influence on the world stage. 
Second, we need to find evidence in the text that relates to the French perspective on Africa. The passage mentions ""African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara"" and the ""callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.""

Ibn Battuta's experiences were LEAST similar to the experiences of which of the following? Choices: a) Zheng He b) Marco Polo c) Lorenzo de Medici d) Xuanzang 
Output:
First, I need to understand what Ibn Battuta's experiences were like. The text describes him traveling to Aden, a port city in Yemen. He notes the city's harsh environment, its reliance on trade, and the wealth and piety of its inhabitants.
Next, I need to consider the experiences of each of the options. Zheng He was a Chinese admiral who led seven voyages of exploration to Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. Marco Polo was a Venetian merchant who traveled to China and wrote about his experiences. Lorenzo de Medici was a wealthy Italian banker and patron of the arts. Xuanzang was a Chinese Buddhist monk who traveled to India to study Buddhism.
Finally, I need to determine which of these individuals had experiences LEAST similar to Ibn Battuta's. While all of these individuals traveled and encountered different cultures, Ibn Battuta's focus on trade, his description of a specific port city, and his observations about the local people's piety and generosity set him apart. Of the choices, Lorenzo de Medici's life as a wealthy banker and patron of the arts is the least similar to Ibn Battuta's experiences.

""Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighboring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations does not make us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our chief safeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws, particularly such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they are actually on the statute book, or belong to that code which, although unwritten, yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace.""

""Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved?

Strange and costly objects do not interest me. If I have commanded that the tribute offerings sent by you, O King, are to be accepted, this was solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar. . . . As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures.

How did the Chinese restrict foreign trade during the era 1750–1900? Choices: a) European merchants were confined to a few cities designated for foreign trade. b) Only the Dutch traded with China; other Europeans had to use them as intermediaries. c) The Chinese imposed extraordinary tariffs on all foreign products. d) They passed laws intended to persecute and harass foreign residents. 
Output:
First, we need to analyze the provided text from the Chinese emperor. The emperor states that he has no need for foreign goods and that the tribute offerings are accepted out of respect for the envoys' journey. This suggests a sense of self-sufficiency and a lack of interest in expanding trade.
Second, we need to consider the historical context of China during the 1750-1900 period. China was a powerful empire with a long tradition of isolationism. They had a relatively closed economy and were not eager to engage in extensive trade with the outside world.
Third, we need to evaluate the answer choices in light of the text and historical context. Option (a) aligns with the Chinese practice of limiting foreign trade to specific ports. This was a way to control and regulate interactions with the outside world.

Crosby's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450–1750 C.E.? Choices: a) The development of direct trade links between Western Europe and India b) The beginning of the Industrial Revolution c) The colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans d) The increasing development of seafaring technologies 
Output:
First, we need to understand Crosby's argument. He claims that a society achieving global hegemony would need a significant productivity increase, achieved by exploiting resources and people from other continents. This suggests a focus on colonialism and resource extraction.
Second, we need to consider the options and their connection to colonialism.  
Option (a) - Direct trade links with India, while important, don't necessarily imply the large-scale exploitation Crosby describes.
Option (b) - The Industrial Revolution came later and wouldn't be the cause of the pre-existing colonial expansion.
Option (c) - The colonization of the Americas fits Crosby's argument perfectly, as it involved exploiting resources and people on a massive scale.

Second, I need to focus on the articles related to religion, specifically Article 5. 
Third, Article 5 states that the Catholic Apostolic Roman Religion will be the official religion, but followers of other religions are allowed to worship privately. This indicates a degree of religious toleration.

Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.
William Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, ""On the Suppression of Sati,"" 1829

Third, we need to determine which choice best encapsulates the overarching context of both passages.

The first passage discusses the practice of sati, a ritual in which a widow was expected to immolate herself on her husband's funeral pyre. Bentinck argues for its abolition, highlighting the cruelty and injustice of the practice. The second passage, on the other hand, advocates for a strict and controlling approach to governing indigenous populations, emphasizing the need for economic dependence and forceful subjugation.

Both passages deal with the exercise of power and control over non-European populations in colonial contexts.

And it dreams. And it loves, and it vibrates, and it is the daughter of the sun.
Be careful. Viva Spanish America!
There are a thousand cubs loosed from the Spanish lion.
Roosevelt, one would have to be, through God himself,
the-fearful rifleman and strong hunter,
to manage to grab us in your iron claws.
And, although you count on everything, you lack one thing: God!
—Adapted from ""To Roosevelt"" by Ruben Dario, 1904

Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.
William Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, ""On the Suppression of Sati,"" 1829
I have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].
George Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826
The tone of the first passage best supports which of the following suppositions about British motivations for eradicating the sati ritual? Choices: a) The British intended principally to Christianize India's Hindu population. b) The British sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority. c) They acted out of a progressive concern for women's equality. d) They were impelled by a racially prejudiced disdain for all Indian customs. 
Output:
First, we need to analyze the tone of the first passage. It expresses a strong moral condemnation of sati, calling it ""cruel"" and ""untimely,"" and emphasizing the horror of allowing it to continue. 
Second, we need to consider the choices and see which one aligns with the tone of the passage. 
Finally, we need to determine which choice best reflects the British motivation for eradicating sati based on the passage's emphasis on morality and the power to prevent it.

""The greatest contribution that Africa can make to the peace of the world is to avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity, by creating a political union which will also by its success, stand as an example to a divided world. A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.""
Kwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961
The inclusion of the Congo in Nkrumah's argument is intended to do which of the following? Choices: a) Demonstrate the possibility of African unity b) Give an example of how African nations are neglected by the world powers c) Present an illustration of how the development of a constitution brings order to nations d) Blame European powers for the difficulties experienced in Africa 
Output:
First, we need to understand the main argument of Nkrumah: Africa needs to unite to gain respect and influence on the world stage.
Second, we need to analyze how the Congo example fits into this argument. Nkrumah highlights the UN's inaction in the Congo, focusing on ""constitutional niceties"" while the country descended into chaos.
Third, this example illustrates how the world powers prioritize their interests over African concerns, neglecting the continent's struggles. This supports Nkrumah's point about the ""callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.""

""The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries. It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.
Non-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments…The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.""
Kwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965
Which of the following is referenced by the co-operation mentioned in the second paragraph? Choices: a) The competing ideologies of the Cold War b) The competing ideologies of World War II c) The competing empires of World War I d) The competing colonization companies in the Scramble for Africa 
Output:
First, we need to understand the context of the passage. It discusses neo-colonialism and the policy of non-alignment. 
Second, we need to focus on the second paragraph, which mentions ""co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy."" This suggests a broad international cooperation beyond just one specific conflict or era.
Third, considering the historical context of the passage (1965), the Cold War (1947-1991) is the most relevant period marked by competing ideologies between capitalist and socialist states.

Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China
In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
What traditional view of world history does this passage seem to challenge? Choices: a) That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies b) That China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation c) That China was hindered by religious fundamentalism when it came to modernizing efforts d) That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change 
Output:
First, let's analyze the passage. It states that while Europe focused on developing gunpowder weapons due to the nature of their warfare, China prioritized horse archer units because they were more effective against their nomadic enemies. 
Second, we need to consider the answer choices and see which one contradicts this information. 
Third, the passage implies that China's technological choices were strategic and context-dependent, not indicative of a general lack of technological prowess. This challenges the view that China has always been less technologically adept than other societies.

The passage below is taken from testimony before Parliament.
Joshua Drake, called in; and Examined.
You say you would prefer moderate labour and lower wages; are you pretty comfortable upon your present wages?
—I have no wages, but two days a week at present; but when I am working at some jobs we can make a little, and at others we do very poorly.
When a child gets 3s. a week, does that go much towards its subsistence?
—No, it will not keep it as it should do.
Why do you allow your children to go to work at those places where they are ill-treated or over-worked?
—Necessity compels a man that has children to let them work.
Then you would not allow your children to go to those factories under the present system, if it was not from necessity?
—No.
—Testimony given before the Sadler Committee, 1831–32
Which type of organization was partially responsible for improving the hours, wages, and working conditions of workers in this era? Choices: a) Guilds b) Joint-stock companies c) Labor unions d) Zaibatsu groups 
Output:
First, we need to understand the context of the testimony. It describes a worker who is struggling to make ends meet and is forced to send his children to work in factories despite the poor conditions. This suggests a need for change in the system.
Second, we need to consider the options provided. Guilds were medieval organizations that regulated trade, joint-stock companies were early forms of corporations, and zaibatsu groups were large Japanese industrial conglomerates. None of these seem directly relevant to the worker's plight.
Third, labor unions are organizations formed by workers to advocate for their rights and improve their working conditions. This aligns perfectly with the context of the testimony and the need for change.

The passage below is the Chinese emperor's response to English King George III's diplomatic envoys, who were seeking expanded trading privileges (1793).
Strange and costly objects do not interest me. If I have commanded that the tribute offerings sent by you, O King, are to be accepted, this was solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar. . . . As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures. It behooves you, O King, to display even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity.
Why were the Chinese not interested in expanding trading rights with Great Britain? Choices: a) The Chinese were angry over Britain's interference in their foreign affairs. b) The Chinese had a preexisting exclusive trade agreement with the Dutch. c) They had no interest in the products that Great Britain could provide. d) They were afraid that the British would gain too much influence within China. 
Output:
First, we need to analyze the emperor's response. He states that he has no use for British manufactures and that strange and costly objects do not interest him. 
Second, we can infer from his words that the Chinese were not interested in expanding trade because they believed they already possessed everything they needed. 
Third, the emperor emphasizes the importance of loyalty and submission to the Chinese throne, suggesting that trade was secondary to maintaining their political dominance.
