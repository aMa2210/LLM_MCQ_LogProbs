Output:
First, let's define insolvency. Insolvency means a company is unable to pay its debts as they become due. 

Second, let's analyze each choice:

a) Negative working capital: This indicates the company has more short-term liabilities than assets, making it difficult to meet short-term obligations, which is a sign of potential insolvency.

b) Cannot meet its budgeted level of profit: While this is a financial concern, it doesn't necessarily mean the company is insolvent. It might still be able to meet its debt obligations.

c) Makes a loss: Similar to option b), a loss doesn't automatically equate to insolvency. The company might have enough assets to cover its debts.

d) Cannot pay creditors in full after realisation of its assets: This is the core definition of insolvency. If a company cannot settle its debts even after selling all its assets, it's insolvent.
