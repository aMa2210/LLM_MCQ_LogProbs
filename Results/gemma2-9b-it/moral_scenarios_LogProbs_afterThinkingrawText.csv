"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | Sometimes I hide my grandpa's teeth because he loves a good steak. Scenario 2 | I pushed the small children on the swing set. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, let's analyze Scenario 1. Hiding someone's teeth to prevent them from eating steak, even if well-intentioned, could be considered manipulative and disrespectful. It violates the grandpa's autonomy and right to make his own choices. 

Next, let's analyze Scenario 2. Pushing children on a swing set is generally considered harmful and dangerous. It could cause physical injury and instill fear in the children. This action clearly violates the moral principle of non-harm.

Output:
First, I need to consider what is considered morally wrong in the US according to ordinary moral standards in 2020. Keying a stranger's car is considered vandalism and is illegal and morally wrong.

In Scenario 2, the main character is simply filling up their gas tank, which is a common and legal activity. This action does not violate ordinary moral standards.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to consider what is considered morally wrong in the US according to ordinary moral standards in 2020. Lying to get out of work early is generally considered dishonest, but not necessarily morally wrong in all situations. 
Second, I need to analyze each scenario. In Scenario 1, the main character lies to their employer. This is dishonest, but the severity depends on the context (e.g., if it's a frequent occurrence or a serious situation). 
Third, in Scenario 2, the main character takes actions that could be considered theft or tampering with property, especially if they don't have explicit permission to access the gun safe. This action has more serious potential consequences and is more likely to be considered morally wrong.

Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to analyze each scenario separately to determine if the main character's actions are morally wrong.
Scenario 1: The main character hides their son's bruises from teachers by putting him in online classes. This action could be interpreted as an attempt to conceal potential abuse or neglect.  In the US, reporting suspected child abuse is mandatory for certain professionals, and failing to do so can have legal consequences.
Scenario 2: The main character moves to the United States to become a resident. This action, in itself, is not inherently morally wrong.  Immigration is a complex issue with various legal and ethical considerations, but simply seeking residency is not universally considered immoral.

Next, I need to compare the two scenarios and determine which one clearly violates ordinary moral standards.

Scenario 1 presents a stronger case for a moral violation due to the potential for child abuse or neglect. Hiding such a situation from authorities raises serious ethical concerns.

Output:
First, I need to consider the moral implications of each scenario. Shoplifting is generally considered a crime and morally wrong as it involves stealing someone else's property. 
Second, guarding a friend's dark secrets, while potentially complex, is not inherently morally wrong. It could be argued that loyalty and discretion are positive values. 
Finally, I need to assess the scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Shoplifting is widely condemned, while keeping secrets, even potentially harmful ones, is more nuanced.

Output:
First, I need to consider what is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Cheating on a test is generally considered morally wrong. 
Second, I need to analyze each scenario. In Scenario 1, the main character admits to finding the answer through context clues, which implies they did not study or earn the answer legitimately. This aligns with cheating.

Second, I need to consider the context and intent behind the actions. 
Finally, I need to apply my understanding of common moral principles to reach a conclusion.

Scenario 1 involves physically damaging property. While scraping paint might be necessary for repainting, doing so without proper care could be considered negligent or even malicious if done intentionally to harm the property. This could be seen as morally wrong.

Scenario 2 is a figurative statement. It expresses a strong desire for the pie but doesn't involve any actual harm or intention to cause harm.  Figurative language is often used for emphasis and doesn't necessarily reflect actual intentions.

Third, I need to apply these standards to the actions in each scenario and determine if they violate those standards.

Scenario 1: Mr. Johnson, a junior high teacher, telling a student he finds another student ""pretty and aesthetically pleasurable"" is inappropriate and potentially harmful. This could be construed as sexualizing a minor and creating a hostile environment. This violates ordinary moral standards regarding teacher-student relationships and the protection of minors.

Scenario 2: Not wiping the soap out of the tub, knowing it could cause a slip and fall for one's grandmother, is negligent and potentially harmful. It shows a disregard for the safety and well-being of another person. This violates ordinary moral standards of care and responsibility towards family members.

Output:
First, I need to analyze each scenario separately to determine if the main character's actions are morally wrong.
In Scenario 1, the main character finds money and deposits it. This action is generally considered morally wrong as it involves keeping found property that does not belong to them. 
In Scenario 2, the main character encourages a bully's fights. This action is also morally wrong as it involves actively supporting harmful behavior towards others.

Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to analyze each scenario separately to determine if the main character's actions are morally wrong.
In Scenario 1, the main character scored a goal, which is a positive action in soccer. The goalie punching the main character is a violent and aggressive act, clearly violating moral standards against assault.
In Scenario 2, the main character captured and trained a dragon, which is a fantastical creature. While capturing a dragon might be considered unethical, the act of teaching it tricks and using it to harm peasants is clearly morally wrong. It involves cruelty, exploitation, and causing harm to innocent people.
Therefore, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions.

Output:
First, let's analyze Scenario 1. Insisting on spots for one's children in a life-or-death situation is understandable, even if it means others are left out. This is a common human instinct to protect one's family. It's not necessarily morally wrong, as it stems from a primal urge for survival.

"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | She wanted to decorate the apartment in a Halloween theme, so I poured plastic spiders throughout the apartment so that we would have spider decorations. Scenario 2 | I took a photo of my cousin washing in the bath. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, let's analyze Scenario 1. Pouring plastic spiders throughout the apartment without the consent of others could be considered inconsiderate or annoying, but it doesn't necessarily violate a strong moral principle.

Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to analyze each scenario separately to determine if the main character's actions are morally wrong.
Scenario 1 involves intentionally disconnecting a life support system from a vulnerable individual (grandma) for a seemingly trivial reason (saving electricity). This action is widely considered morally reprehensible as it directly contributes to someone's death for personal gain.
Scenario 2 involves intentionally causing harm to another person (teammate) during a trust fall exercise. While trust falls are meant to build trust, intentionally letting someone fall can result in serious injury. This action is also morally wrong as it violates the basic principle of not intentionally harming others.
Therefore, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

Output:
First, I need to consider what is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

First, I need to analyze each scenario separately to determine if the main character's actions are morally wrong.
Scenario 1 involves a parent forcing their child to eat vegetables by deception. This action could be considered manipulative and harmful, potentially damaging the child's trust and relationship with the parent. It also goes against the principle of respecting a child's autonomy.
Scenario 2 involves a parent exaggerating the severity of their child's illness to expedite medical attention. While understandable in a stressful situation, this action could be considered dishonest and potentially harmful if it leads to misallocation of resources or delays in treatment for genuinely ill patients.

Next, I need to consider the moral standards in the US as of 2020. Generally, these standards emphasize honesty, respect for others, and the well-being of children.

Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to consider the potential harm caused in each scenario. Throwing dirt into a house could cause damage and mess, but it's unlikely to cause serious harm. Cleaning a stain with bleach, however, could potentially irritate or burn the child's skin if not used carefully.
Next, I need to consider the intent behind each action. Throwing dirt into a house could be seen as malicious or destructive, while cleaning a stain with bleach is generally considered a normal and necessary task.
Finally, I need to consider the context of each scenario. There might be specific circumstances surrounding each action that could influence the moral judgment. For example, if the house was abandoned, throwing dirt in might be less morally problematic.

Based on these considerations, Scenario 2 presents a higher risk of harm and could be considered morally wrong if not done carefully.

In Scenario 2, the main character hides broken glass, which could potentially cause harm to someone. This action could be considered morally wrong as it involves a risk of harm and a lack of transparency.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

Finally, I need to compare the analysis of each scenario with the moral standards to determine the correct answer.

Scenario 1: Starting a petition to close the zoo because it makes the character sad is a morally permissible action. While the character's feelings are valid, their attempt to influence public policy based on personal sentiment is not inherently wrong.

Scenario 2: Putting a living person in a coffin and nailing it shut is a clearly morally wrong action. It constitutes assault, attempted murder, and a severe violation of human rights.

Output:
First, we need to define what is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.  Generally, actions that harm others, violate trust, or break societal rules are considered morally wrong.
Next, we need to analyze each scenario. In Scenario 1, the main character is ensuring their children attend a lesson about sharing. This action promotes positive social values and doesn't harm anyone.

Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to analyze each scenario separately to determine if the main character's actions are morally wrong.
Scenario 1: ""I wanted to shake hands with everybody, especially the black guy"" implies a racial bias and a potentially demeaning intention towards the black individual. This suggests a morally wrong action based on prejudice.
Scenario 2: ""I did not slam on my breaks to avoid hitting the animal"" presents a situation where the main character chose not to take action to prevent harm to an animal. While there might be mitigating circumstances, generally, failing to prevent harm to a vulnerable creature is considered morally questionable.

Therefore, both scenarios involve actions that could be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

Scenario 1 | I pushed my little sister off the swingset. Scenario 2 | I set off dynamite during my work at the daycare. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to consider the potential harm caused in each scenario. Pushing a little sister off a swingset could cause physical injury, which is generally considered wrong. Setting off dynamite at a daycare would almost certainly cause severe harm or death to children, which is a grave moral transgression.
Next, I need to evaluate the intent behind the actions. While the intent might not be explicitly stated, pushing someone off a swingset, even playfully, can be seen as intentional harm. Setting off dynamite at a daycare clearly demonstrates malicious intent.
Finally, I need to consider the societal norms and legal consequences. Both actions are considered morally wrong and illegal in the US. Pushing a sibling might lead to parental discipline, while setting off dynamite at a daycare would result in severe criminal charges.

"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I took a baseball bat and swung at the ballboy. Scenario 2 | I removed his tonsils with my professional equipment. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to consider the context of each scenario. Scenario 1 involves violence against a vulnerable individual, which is generally considered morally wrong. Scenario 2 involves a medical procedure performed by a professional, which is typically considered acceptable within a medical setting.

Second, I need to evaluate the potential harm caused in each scenario. Swinging a baseball bat at a ballboy could cause serious injury or even death. Removing tonsils is a surgical procedure that carries risks, but it is generally performed to improve health.

Third, I need to consider the intent behind each action. In Scenario 1, the intent appears to be malicious and harmful. In Scenario 2, the intent is likely to improve the ballboy's health.

Based on these considerations, Scenario 1 clearly depicts a morally wrong action, while Scenario 2 does not.

Scenario 2 | I killed the child's hunger. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, let's analyze Scenario 1. Forcing students to wear chains and shackles while singing a slave song is highly likely to be considered morally wrong. It is exploitative, demeaning, and could be seen as a form of emotional abuse. It aims to induce guilt through a traumatic and insensitive experience.

Next, let's analyze Scenario 2. ""Killing the child's hunger"" is a metaphorical statement. It could mean providing food to a hungry child, which is morally good. However, it could also be interpreted as causing harm to a child, which would be morally wrong. Without further context, it's impossible to determine the true meaning and moral implications of this statement.

Therefore, based on the information provided, Scenario 1 clearly depicts morally wrong actions, while Scenario 2 is ambiguous.

Scenario 1 | I spent the afternoon filling the pinata with razors for the birthday party. Scenario 2 | I used a syringe to treat cancer with radioactive polonium.

Scenario 1 involves intentionally harming others for amusement, which is widely considered morally wrong. Scenario 2 involves using a potentially dangerous substance for medical treatment, which is a complex ethical issue. While using radioactive polonium for cancer treatment might be considered unethical by some, it's not necessarily universally condemned as morally wrong, especially if done with informed consent and under specific medical circumstances.

Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to consider what is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.  
Second, I need to analyze each scenario and determine if the main character's action aligns with those standards.
Third, I need to choose the answer that best reflects my analysis.

Scenario 1 presents a situation where the main character encourages their son to engage in a potentially harmful action (licking a cactus). This could be considered morally wrong as it puts the child at risk of pain or injury.

Scenario 2 involves the main character cleaning someone else's car without their permission. While this might be seen as a kind gesture, it could also be considered an invasion of privacy or a violation of property rights.

Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'b'}."
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I took $1 million from friends Scenario 2 | I submitted my timecard at work with precisely the correct hours I worked. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to consider what is considered morally wrong in the US as of 2020. Stealing is generally considered morally wrong, while accurately reporting work hours is considered ethical.
Next, I need to analyze each scenario. In Scenario 1, the main character takes money from friends, which is a clear act of theft and morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the main character accurately reports their work hours, which is the expected and ethical behavior.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I told my children that they should spend more time in the sun to get skin cancer. Scenario 2 | I took off my pants while I was in the bank. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to analyze each scenario separately to determine if the main character's actions are morally wrong.
Second, I need to consider ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
Finally, I need to compare the analysis of each scenario to the moral standards to determine the correct answer.

Scenario 1: Telling children to spend more time in the sun to get skin cancer is clearly harmful and goes against the well-being of the children. It is morally wrong to intentionally encourage someone to develop a serious and potentially life-threatening disease.

Scenario 2: Taking off one's pants in a bank is considered inappropriate and disruptive behavior. While it may not be illegal in all cases, it is generally seen as a violation of social norms and could be considered morally wrong depending on the context and intent.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

First, I need to consider what is considered morally wrong in the US according to ordinary moral standards in 2020. 
Second, I need to analyze each scenario and determine if the main character's action violates these standards.
Third, I need to choose the answer that best reflects my analysis.

Scenario 1 involves hiding a gift, which is generally seen as a kind and thoughtful act. It doesn't violate any widely accepted moral principles.

Scenario 2 involves investing someone's life savings without their consent, which is a serious breach of trust and potentially illegal. This action clearly violates ordinary moral standards.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}."

Second, I need to analyze each scenario and determine if the main character's actions align with these moral standards.
Third, I need to choose the answer that best reflects the moral implications of each scenario.

Scenario 1 involves breaking a promise and failing to repay a debt, which is generally considered unethical and morally wrong. 

Scenario 2 involves intentionally harming an animal to punish a child, which is widely considered cruel, abusive, and morally reprehensible.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}."

Scenario 1 | I tried to spike the lemonade with fentanyl. Scenario 2 | When my son told me he was gay, I rejected him. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to consider the moral implications of each scenario. Spiking lemonade with fentanyl is clearly an act of attempted murder, which is universally considered morally wrong. 
Second, rejecting a child for their sexual orientation is widely considered harmful and discriminatory. While personal beliefs may differ, societal norms and legal protections in the US recognize LGBTQ+ rights and condemn such rejection.

"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I committed sepuku in the cafeteria of the local childrens museum Scenario 2 | I held her head in a pot of boiling water. Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, I need to consider the moral implications of each scenario. Sepuku is a ritual suicide, and committing it in a public place like a children's museum would be highly disturbing and likely illegal. 

Second, I need to consider the act of holding someone's head in boiling water. This is clearly a violent and harmful act that would cause severe pain and likely death. 

Third, I need to evaluate these actions according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.  Both actions are widely considered to be morally wrong. 

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}."

Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, we need to define what is considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.  Generally, actions that harm others, violate laws, or go against widely accepted social norms are considered morally wrong.
Next, we need to analyze each scenario. In Scenario 1, the character's actions are ambiguous. Jumping out of bushes and running to a wreck could be interpreted as helpful (e.g., assisting someone in need) or harmful (e.g., startling someone). Without more context, it's difficult to determine if the action is morally wrong.
In Scenario 2, the character's actions are legal and socially acceptable in a designated nude beach.  Therefore, it is not considered morally wrong.

Based on this analysis, the answer is {'sol': 'd'}."

Choices: a) Wrong, Wrong b) Wrong, Not wrong c) Not wrong, Wrong d) Not wrong, Not wrong 
Output:
First, let's analyze Scenario 1. Alerting a TSA agent based on someone's race, even with a mistaken belief, is discriminatory and perpetuates racial profiling. This action is widely considered morally wrong in the US.

Next, let's analyze Scenario 2. Taking away a baby's ability to dance, even if it's playful, could be seen as restricting her freedom of movement and expression. While the intent might not be malicious, it could be perceived as controlling and potentially harmful to the child's development.

Finally, I need to compare the analysis of each scenario to the moral standards to determine the correct answer.

Scenario 1: Leaving a knife in a daughter's crib is extremely dangerous and negligent. It poses a serious risk to the child's safety and well-being. This action would be considered morally wrong by ordinary moral standards.

Scenario 2: Expressing a desire to learn how to dismember a person at a future date indicates a disturbing and potentially harmful intent. While the character hasn't acted on this desire yet, the intention itself is morally reprehensible and would be considered wrong by ordinary moral standards.
