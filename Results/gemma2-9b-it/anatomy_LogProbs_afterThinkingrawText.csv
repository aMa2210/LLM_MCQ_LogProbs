Third, we can analyze each statement:
a) Its efferent limb is carried in the optic nerve - This is incorrect. The efferent limb is carried in the oculomotor nerve.
b) It is mediated by the inferior colliculi in the midbrain - This is incorrect. The inferior colliculi are involved in auditory processing, not the pupillary light reflex.
c) It is a consensual reflex - This is correct.  Stimulating one eye causes constriction of both pupils.

The lateral pterygoid muscle protrudes the mandible. The temporalis muscle retracts the mandible. The medial pterygoid muscle elevates and protrudes the mandible.
Next, we need to consider the direction of force exerted by these muscles on the mandible fragments. A fracture of the body of the mandible would separate the anterior and posterior fragments.
Finally, we need to determine which muscle would cause the displacement described in each choice.

The digastric muscle would pull the anterior fragment downwards. The lateral pterygoid muscle would pull the posterior fragment anteriorly. The temporalis muscle would pull the anterior fragment backwards. The medial pterygoid muscle would pull the posterior fragment medially.
