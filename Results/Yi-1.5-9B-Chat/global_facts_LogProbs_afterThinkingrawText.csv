"Input: What was GDP per capita in the United States in 1850  when adjusting for inflation and PPP in 2011  prices?  Choices: a) About $300  b) About $3 k c) About $8 k d) About $15 k 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the question.  The question is asking for the GDP per capita in the United States in 1850,  adjusted for inflation to 2011  prices.
 To answer this,  I would need to look up the nominal GDP per capita in 1850 and the GDP deflator (a measure of inflation) for that year.  Then,  I would use those values to calculate the real GDP per capita in 2011  prices.
 However,  the question also mentions PPP (purchasing power parity).  PPP is a method used to compare the cost of living between countries,  and it adjusts for differences in the price level due to differences in the cost of living between countries.  Since the question is about the United States,  PPP is not relevant in this context.
 So,  I will focus on adjusting the nominal GDP per capita in 1850 for inflation to 2011  prices.
 According to historical data,  the nominal GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 was about $300.  The GDP deflator for 1850 was approximately 3.
 To adjust for inflation,  I divide the nominal GDP per capita by the GDP deflator: $300  ÷ 3  = $100.
 Therefore,  the GDP per capita in the United States in 1850,  adjusted for inflation to 2011  prices,  is about $100.

 Output:
 First,  I need to find the GDP per capita in 1950  and 2016  in Japan,  considering inflation and PPP-adjustment.
 According to the World Bank data,  the GDP per capita in Japan in 1950  was approximately $3,000  (in 2011  dollars and PPP).
 In 2016,  the GDP per capita in Japan was approximately $40,000  (in 2011  dollars and PPP).

"Input: As of 2015,  about what percentage of the world’s land area is forested?  Choices: a) 15 % b) 30 % c) 45 % d) 60 % 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the data available.  As of 2015,  the global forest area is approximately 3.02 billion hectares.
 Next,  I need to calculate the total land area of the Earth.  The Earth's total surface area is about 510 million square kilometers,  of which about 71% is covered by water and 29% by land.
 To find the land area,  I multiply the total surface area by 29%: 510 million km² * 0.29 = 147.9 million km² or 147,900,000 hectares.
 Now,  I need to calculate the percentage of the world's land area that is forested.  I divide the forest area by the land area and multiply by 100 to get the percentage: (3.02 billion hectares ÷ 147.9 million hectares) * 100 = 20.4%.
 However,  the closest answer choice to this percentage is {'sol': 'a'}"
