 Output:
 First, let's consider the definition of libel. Libel is a legal term that refers to the publication of a false statement that is damaging to a person's or entity's reputation.

"Input: You are the community relations director for a public water utility that has been targeted by a group of activists opposed to adding fluoride to drinking water.  The activists are waging an intense internet campaign against the practice.  Your utility has overwhelming evidence of the health benefits to fluoridated water.  The manager of the utility asks you to initiate a blog to get the health message out.  What is the most appropriate course of action?  Choices: a) Use utility employees to write the blog,  posing as dentists and physicians.  b) Recruit a group of volunteer dentists and physicians to write the blog under their own identities with no reference to the utility.  c) Write the blog yourself,  identifying yourself as an employee of the utility,  and quote the scientific opinions of a variety of sources.  d) Compensate a group of dentists and physicians to write the blog,  identifying the utility as the sponsor of the blog but without disclosing the compensation.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the credibility and transparency of the blog.  Using utility employees to write the blog (option a) could be seen as biased and potentially misleading, as the employees are not independent experts.
 Next,  recruiting volunteer dentists and physicians (option b) is a more credible approach,  as they are independent experts who can write under their own identities.  This option also maintains transparency,  as there is no reference to the utility.
 Writing the blog myself (option c) could work,  but identifying as an employee of the utility might raise questions about bias.  Quoting scientific opinions from a variety of sources can help mitigate this.
 Compensating dentists and physicians (option d) could increase the credibility of the blog,  but disclosing the compensation is crucial for maintaining transparency and avoiding any appearance of bias.

The most appropriate course of action is to recruit a group of volunteer dentists and physicians to write the blog under their own identities with no reference to the utility (option b).  This approach maintains credibility and transparency.

 The planning phase focuses on setting goals and determining the best ways to achieve them,  but it does not necessarily involve executing the strategies and tactics.
 The evaluation phase is about assessing the effectiveness of the PR efforts,  not about making decisions and executing strategies.

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the impact of social media on each of the given areas.  Social media has been used by politicians to engage with the public,  share news,  and respond to criticism.  This has led to a more immediate and direct impact on politics.
 Retail businesses have used social media to market their products,  engage with customers,  and improve customer service.  However,  the impact is not as immediate as in politics.
 Automotive sales have also used social media to reach potential customers,  share news,  and engage with the public.  The impact is similar to that of retail businesses.
 Nonprofits have used social media to raise awareness,  engage with supporters,  and share their mission.  The impact is not as immediate as in politics.

Timeliness means the news is delivered as soon as possible.  Prominence refers to the visibility of the news.  Impact refers to the effect the news has on the audience.

Next,  I need to consider the context of public relations messages distributed through the mass media.  Public relations messages are often aimed at influencing public opinion or building relationships with stakeholders.  In this context,  the most important criterion would likely be the one that has the greatest impact on the audience.

Finally,  I compare the choices to the context.  Proximity might be important for local audiences,  but not as critical for mass media.  Timeliness is important for breaking news,  but not as critical for public relations messages.  Prominence is important for visibility,  but not as critical for the impact on the audience.  Impact is the criterion that directly relates to the goal of public relations messages,  which is to influence the audience.

 The situation analysis is focused on gathering information about the audience, environment, and other factors that will affect the communication.  It does not involve planning what should be said and why.
 The strategy stage is where the focus is on developing the overall approach to the communication, including the message and purpose.  This stage involves planning what should be said and why.
 The implementation stage is about putting the plan into action, not planning the content.
 The evaluation stage is about assessing the effectiveness of the communication, not planning the content.

"Input: Which form of communication is most effective in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue?  Choices: a) Interpersonal b) Media c) Group d) Public 
 Output:
 First,  we need to consider the context of communication and its impact on predispositions.  Interpersonal communication involves direct,  face-to-face interactions, which can be effective in building trust and understanding, but it may not reach a wide audience.
 Media communication,  such as television,  radio,  and newspapers,  can reach a large audience and can be used to spread information quickly,  but it may not be as effective in forming or changing deep-seated beliefs.
 Group communication,  such as in a community meeting or a social group,  can be effective in discussing and debating an issue,  but it may not reach everyone and may not be as objective as other forms.
 Public communication,  such as speeches or presentations in public events,  can be effective in reaching a wide audience and can be used to convey important messages,  but it may not be as personal or engaging as interpersonal communication.

Considering these factors,  the most effective form of communication in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue is {'sol': 'a'}"

"Input: According to Esman (1972 ),  which publics help an organization to exist by lending authority or assistance?  Choices: a) Enabling b) Functional c) Normative d) Diffused 
 Output:
 First,  I need to recall the concept of publics as described by Esman (1972).  Esman classified publics into four categories based on their relationship with an organization: enabling, functional, normative, and diffuse.
 Next,  I need to understand the role and function of each type of public.  Enabling publics provide the organization with authority or assistance, allowing it to exist and function.  Functional publics are involved in the day-to-day operations of the organization.  Normative publics support the values and goals of the organization.  Diffused publics are not specifically targeted by the organization but may be affected by its actions.
 Finally,  I need to match the description of the role of the public with the appropriate choice.  According to Esman (1972),  the type of public that helps an organization to exist by lending authority or assistance is the enabling public.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
