"Input: You bought a limousine for $98,000  and are planning to rent it for weddings,  ceremonies and parties at $245  per hour.  If you estimate the car will be hired for 2  hours a day on average,  with daily costs at about $50,  what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round,  i. e.  every day of the year,  including any festivities and weekends?  Choices: a) 164 % b) 1.64 % c) 0.45 % d) 183 % 
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate the daily income from renting the limousine. For 2 hours a day, the income is 2 * $245 = $490.
 Next, I need to subtract the daily costs from the daily income to find the daily profit: $490 - $50 = $440.
 To find the yearly profit, I multiply the daily profit by the number of days in a year: $440 * 365 = $160,600.
 Now, I need to calculate the estimated yearly yield on the investment. The yield is the yearly profit divided by the initial investment, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage: ($160,600 / $98,000) * 100 = 164%.
 Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Arno Co.  did not record a credit purchase of merchandise made prior to year end.  However the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory.  What effect did the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise have on Arno's balance sheet at year end?  Assets Liabilities Choices: a) No effect No effect b) No effect Understated c) Understated No effect d) Understated Understated 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the impact of the omission on the balance sheet accounts.  The omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise means that the inventory (an asset) is understated because the merchandise was included in the year-end physical inventory but not recorded as a purchase.
 Next,  I need to consider the impact on liabilities.  Since the purchase was not recorded, it also means that the corresponding accounts payable (a liability) is not recorded, so it is also understated.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following statements about audit sampling risks is correct for a nonissuer?  Choices: a) Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that,  when a substantive test is restricted to a sample,  conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.  b) Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.  c) Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.  d) Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of nonsampling risk and sampling risk.  Nonsampling risk refers to risks that are not related to the selection of the sample,  while sampling risk refers to the risk that arises from the uncertainty in selecting the sample.
 Next,  I need to analyze each statement to determine which one correctly describes nonsampling risk for a nonissuer.  Statement a) describes nonsampling risk by mentioning that conclusions might be different when testing a sample compared to the entire population.  Statement b) also correctly describes nonsampling risk by mentioning that an auditor might fail to recognize misstatements.  Statement c) describes sampling risk by mentioning uncertainty in applying audit procedures,  not nonsampling risk.  Statement d) also describes sampling risk by mentioning the possibility of selecting inappropriate audit procedures.
 Therefore,  the correct answers are {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following procedures would an auditor generally perform regarding subsequent events?  Choices: a) Inspect inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end.  b) Test internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate.  c) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.  d) Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what subsequent events are.  Subsequent events are events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued.  These events can affect the financial statements.
 Next,  I need to consider which of the given procedures would an auditor generally perform regarding subsequent events.  The auditor's goal is to identify and assess the impact of these events on the financial statements.
 Now,  I will evaluate each choice:
 a) Inspecting inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end is relevant because these items could be included in the financial statements but were not accounted for.
 b) Testing internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate is not directly related to subsequent events, as it focuses on past control deficiencies rather than new events.
 c) Reviewing the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end is relevant because it helps identify any transactions that occurred after the year end but before the financial statements were issued.
 d) Comparing the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited is not directly related to subsequent events, as it focuses on comparing different periods rather than assessing the impact of new events.

Based on the analysis, the procedures that an auditor would generally perform regarding subsequent events are inspecting inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end (choice a) and reviewing the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end (choice c). Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'ac'}"
"Input: The FASB makes changes to the Accounting Standards Codification by issuing Choices: a) Accounting Standards Updates.  b) Emerging Issues Task Force Releases.  c) Statements of Financial Accounting Standards.  d) Staff Technical Bulletins.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what the FASB does.  The FASB is responsible for establishing and improving Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the United States.
 Next,  I need to identify how the FASB makes changes to the Accounting Standards Codification.  The FASB does this by issuing different types of documents.
 Finally,  I need to determine which of the given choices is the correct answer.  The correct answer is that the FASB makes changes to the Accounting Standards Codification by issuing {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: An investment project costing $500  today will generate profits of $500  in year five and year ten.  If the discount rate is 10 %,  what is the project’s NPV?  Choices: a) −$3  b) −$27  c) $3  d) $500  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the present value of the future profits.  The profit in year five is $500,  and the profit in year ten is also $500.  To find the present value,  I will use the formula PV = FV / (1 + r)^n,  where PV is the present value,  FV is the future value,  r is the discount rate,  and n is the number of years.
 For the profit in year five,  the present value is $500 / (1 + 0.10)^5 = $310.46.
 For the profit in year ten,  the present value is $500 / (1 + 0.10)^10 = $135.34.
 The total present value of the profits is $310.46 + $135.34 = $445.80.
 Now,  I need to calculate the net present value (NPV).  The NPV is the total present value of the profits minus the initial investment.  So,  NPV = $445.80 - $500 = -$54.20.
 However,  the choices provided do not include -$54.20.  The closest choice is b) -$27.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: On July 1  year 7  Dean Co.  issued at a premium bonds with a due date of July 1  year 12.  Dean incorrectly used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method to amortize the premium.  How were the following amounts affected by the error at June 30  year 12?  Bond carrying Retained amount earnings Choices: a) Overstated Understated b) Understated Overstated c) Overstated No effect d) No effect No effect 
 Output:
 First, let's understand the impact of using the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method on the bond premium amortization.

The straight-line method allocates the premium evenly over the bond's life, while the effective interest method allocates the premium based on the carrying value of the bond and the effective interest rate. When using the straight-line method, the amortization of the premium is less than the effective interest method, leading to higher carrying values for the bond.

Now, let's consider the impact on the bond carrying amount and retained earnings at June 30, year 12.

1. Bond carrying amount: Since the straight-line method results in higher carrying values than the effective interest method, the bond carrying amount at June 30, year 12, would be overstated due to the error.

2. Retained earnings: The error in amortizing the bond premium would lead to an overstatement of interest expense and, consequently, an overstatement of net income. This overstatement of net income would lead to an overstatement of retained earnings, as the excess income is not properly allocated to other comprehensive income or other components of equity.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: What is the price of a three-year bond (face value $100 ),  paying 5 % coupons,  with a yield of 6 %?  Choices: a) $100  b) $104.29  c) $96.71  d) $97.33  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the present value of the bond's coupon payments.  The coupon rate is 5 %,  so the annual coupon payment is 5 % * $100  = $5.
 The yield rate is 6 %,  so the present value of the coupon payments can be calculated using the formula for the present value of an annuity: $5  * (1 - (1 + 0.06)^-3) / 0.06  = $12.78.
 Next,  I need to calculate the present value of the bond's face value.  The face value is $100,  and the yield rate is 6 %,  so the present value is $100  / (1 + 0.06)^3  = $83.96.
 The price of the bond is the sum of the present values of the coupon payments and the face value: $12.78 + $83.96 = $96.74.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A company recently moved to a new building.  The old building is being actively marketed for sale,  and the company expects to complete the sale in four months.  Each of the following statements is correct regarding the old building,  except: Choices: a) It will be reclassified as an asset held for sale.  b) It will be classified as a current asset.  c) It will no longer be depreciated.  d) It will be valued at historical cost.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the criteria for reclassifying an asset as held for sale.  An asset is considered held for sale when it is intended to be disposed of in the near term,  usually within one year.
 Next,  I need to consider the implications of reclassifying the old building as held for sale.  When an asset is held for sale,  it is typically removed from the property,  plant,  and equipment section of the balance sheet and reclassified as a separate line item.
 Additionally,  an asset held for sale is not depreciated,  as depreciation is intended to reflect the expected decline in value of a long-term asset.
 Finally,  I need to consider the valuation of the old building.  When an asset is held for sale,  it is typically valued at fair market value,  not historical cost.

Now,  I will evaluate each statement:
a) It will be reclassified as an asset held for sale.  - This is correct,  as the old building is being marketed for sale and will be disposed of in the near term.
b) It will be classified as a current asset.  - This is incorrect,  as the old building is a long-term asset and will be reclassified as held for sale,  not as a current asset.
c) It will no longer be depreciated.  - This is correct,  as an asset held for sale is not depreciated.
d) It will be valued at historical cost.  - This is incorrect,  as an asset held for sale is typically valued at fair market value,  not historical cost.

"Input: Carson owned 40 % of the outstanding stock of a C corporation.  During a tax year,  the corporation reported $400,000  in taxable income and distributed a total of $70,000  in cash dividends to its shareholders.  Carson accurately reported $28,000  in gross income on Carson’s individual tax return.  If the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions to the owners had been proportionate,  how much income would Carson have reported on Carson’s individual return?  Choices: a) $28,000  b) $132,000  c) $160,000  d) $188,000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine Carson's share of the corporation's taxable income.  Carson owns 40% of the stock,  so Carson's share is 40% of $400,000  = 0.40 * $400,000  = $160,000.
 Next,  I need to consider the cash dividends distributed by the corporation.  Carson received 40% of the $70,000  in cash dividends,  so Carson's share is 40% of $70,000  = 0.40 * $70,000  = $28,000.
 If the corporation had been an S corporation,  the distributions would have been proportionate to the owners' shares. Therefore,  Carson's share of the $160,000  in taxable income would still be $160,000.
 Since the distributions are proportionate,  Carson would report the same amount of income as their share of the taxable income, which is $160,000.

"Input: An investment will pay out $10  p. a.  forever.  What is that investment worth if the market discount rate is 5 %?  Choices: a) $100  b) $2  c) $500  d) $200  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand that this is a perpetuity,  which is an investment that pays out forever.  The formula to calculate the present value of a perpetuity is P / r,  where P is the annual payment and r is the discount rate.
 In this case,  the annual payment is $10  and the discount rate is 5 %,  or 0.05  as a decimal.
 Using the formula,  I calculate the present value: $10  / 0.05  = $200.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Smith has an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $120,000  without taking into consideration $40,000  of losses from rental real estate activities.  Smith actively participates in the rental real estate activities.  What amount of the rental losses may Smith deduct in determining taxable income?  Choices: a) $0  b) $15,000  c) $20,000  d) $40,000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the passive activity loss (PAL) rules.  Since Smith actively participates in the rental real estate activities,  the PAL rules do not apply.
 Next,  I need to consider the at-risk rules.  Since Smith has $40,000  of losses from rental real estate activities and an AGI of $120,000,  Smith is considered to be at risk for the full amount of the losses.
 Finally,  I need to consider the deductible amount of the losses.  Since the PAL rules do not apply and Smith is at risk for the full amount of the losses,  Smith may deduct the full amount of the losses in determining taxable income.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following is an element of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures applicable to the firm's accounting and auditing practice?  Choices: a) Engagement performance.  b) Risk analysis.  c) Safeguarding of assets.  d) Information processing.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the question and identify the element of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures that is specifically related to the firm's accounting and auditing practice.
 Next,  I will go through the choices and evaluate which one is most relevant to the accounting and auditing practice.  a) Engagement performance is relevant because it deals with how well the firm performs its engagements,  which includes accounting and auditing.  b) Risk analysis is also relevant because it involves identifying and assessing risks in the accounting and auditing process.  c) Safeguarding of assets is more related to internal controls and financial reporting,  not specifically to the accounting and auditing practice.  d) Information processing is related to the overall operations of the firm,  not specifically to the accounting and auditing practice.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A company predicted that it would manufacture 10,000  units of finished goods during March.  The direct labor standards indicated that each unit of finished goods requires 2.4  direct labor hours at a standard wage of $20  per hour,  totaling $48.00  per finished good unit.  During March,  the company actually made 9,000  units of finished goods.  Production used 2.5  labor hours per finished unit,  and the company actually paid $21  per hour,  totaling $52.50  per unit of finished product.  What amount is the company's direct labor rate variance for March?  Choices: a) $18,000  b) $22,500  c) $25,000  d) $40,500  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the actual direct labor cost per unit.  The actual wage rate is $21  per hour,  and the actual labor hours per unit are 2.5  hours,  so the actual direct labor cost per unit is $21  * 2.5  = $52.50.
 Next,  I need to compare the actual direct labor cost per unit to the standard direct labor cost per unit.  The standard wage rate is $20  per hour,  and the standard labor hours per unit are 2.4  hours,  so the standard direct labor cost per unit is $20  * 2.4  = $48.00.
 The direct labor rate variance is the difference between the actual and standard direct labor cost per unit,  multiplied by the actual number of units produced.  The variance is ($52.50 - $48.00) * 9,000  = $4.50 * 9,000  = $40,500.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The full-employment gross domestic product is $1.3  trillion,  and the actual gross domestic product is $1.2  trillion.  The marginal propensity to consume is 0.8.  When inflation is ignored,  what increase in government expenditures is necessary to produce full employment?  Choices: a) $100  billion b) $80  billion c) $20  billion d) $10  billion 
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the difference between the full-employment gross domestic product and the actual gross domestic product: $1.3  trillion - $1.2  trillion = $0.1  trillion.
 This difference represents the increase in aggregate demand needed to achieve full employment.
 Next,  I need to use the marginal propensity to consume to calculate the spending multiplier.  The spending multiplier is 1 ÷ (1 - marginal propensity to consume),  so in this case,  it is 1 ÷ (1 - 0.8) = 5.
 The spending multiplier tells us how much the increase in government expenditures needs to be to achieve the desired increase in aggregate demand.
 To find the necessary increase in government expenditures,  I divide the increase in aggregate demand by the spending multiplier: $0.1  trillion ÷ 5 = $0.02  trillion.
 Converting this to billions,  I get $0.02  trillion = $20  billion.

"Input: Which of the following types of audit evidence provides the least assurance of reliability?  Choices: a) Receivable confirmations received from the client’s customers.  b) Prenumbered receiving reports completed by the client’s employees.  c) Prior months’ bank statements obtained from the client.  d) Municipal property tax bills prepared in the client’s name.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the source and nature of each type of audit evidence.  Receivable confirmations received from the client’s customers are direct evidence provided by third parties, which is generally considered reliable.
 Prenumbered receiving reports completed by the client’s employees could be subject to errors or manipulation, as they are internal documents prepared by the client’s employees.
 Prior months’ bank statements obtained from the client are external documents that can be verified against the client’s records, providing a basis for comparison and analysis.
 Municipal property tax bills prepared in the client’s name are external documents that can be used to verify the client’s ownership of properties and provide additional context for the client's financial position.

Now, I need to determine which type of evidence is least reliable. Among the choices, prenumbered receiving reports completed by the client’s employees are the least reliable because they are internal documents that could be subject to errors or manipulation.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: During year 2  Pipp Co.  incurred the following costs to develop and produce a routine low-risk computer software product: Completion of detailed program design $10000  Costs incurred for coding and testing to establish technological feasibility $15000  Other coding and testing costs incurred after establishment of technological feasibility $44000  In Pipp's December 31  year 2  balance sheet what amount should be capitalized as software cost?  Choices: a) $10,000  b) $25,000  c) $44,000  d) 59000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the costs that are capitalizable as software costs.  According to accounting principles,  costs incurred before technological feasibility is established can be capitalized.
 The cost of $10000  for completing detailed program design and the cost of $15000  for coding and testing to establish technological feasibility are both capitalizable.
 Next,  I need to consider the costs incurred after technological feasibility is established.  The cost of $44000  for other coding and testing costs is also capitalizable.
 To find the total capitalized software cost,  I add the capitalizable costs: $10000  + $15000  + $44000  = $59000.

"Input: During an engagement to compile the financial statements of a nonissuer an accountant becomes aware that management had stated land at appraised value and that if GAAP had been followed both the land account and stockholders' equity would have been decreased by $1  million a material amount.  The accountant decides to modify the standard compilation report because management will not revise the financial statements.  Under these circumstances the accountant should Choices: a) Issue either an adverse opinion or a qualified opinion depending on materiality because of the departure from GAAP.  b) Add a separate paragraph to the accountant's report that restricts the distribution of the financial statements to ‚Äúinternal use only. ‚Äù c) Add a separate paragraph to the accountant's report that discloses the departure from GAAP and its effects on the financial statements.  d) Add a separate paragraph to the accountant's report that explains the underlying purpose of recording assets at historical cost.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the situation.  The accountant is engaged to compile financial statements of a nonissuer and becomes aware of a material misstatement in the land account due to management's use of appraised value instead of GAAP-required historical cost.  This misstatement would have decreased both the land account and stockholders' equity by $1 million.

Next,  the accountant is faced with a decision due to management's refusal to revise the financial statements.  The options provided are to issue an opinion, add a restriction, disclose the departure from GAAP, or explain the underlying purpose of recording assets at historical cost.

Considering the nature of the engagement and the fact that the accountant is not in a position to issue an opinion due to the lack of assurance services, the most appropriate action is to disclose the material misstatement and its effects on the financial statements.  This is in line with the AICPA's Standards on Compilation Engagements, which require the accountant to communicate significant issues to management.

Therefore,  the correct action is to add a separate paragraph to the accountant's report that discloses the departure from GAAP and its effects on the financial statements.  This corresponds to option c).

"Input: Under the Sales Article of the UCC,  which of the following circumstances best describes how the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose arises in a sale of goods transaction?  Choices: a) The buyer is purchasing the goods for a particular purpose and is relying on the seller’s skill or judgment to select suitable goods.  b) The buyer is purchasing the goods for a particular purpose and the seller is a merchant in such goods.  c) The seller knows the particular purpose for which the buyer will use the goods and knows the buyer is relying on the seller’s skill or judgment to select suitable goods.  d) The seller knows the particular purpose for which the buyer will use the goods and the seller is a merchant in such goods.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the circumstances under which the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose arises under the Sales Article of the UCC.  The UCC states that this warranty arises when the buyer relies on the seller's skill or judgment to select suitable goods for a particular purpose.

Next,  I need to consider the choices provided and determine which one best fits the UCC's criteria.  Choice a) states that the buyer is purchasing the goods for a particular purpose and is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select suitable goods.  This directly aligns with the UCC's criteria.

Choice b) states that the buyer is purchasing the goods for a particular purpose and the seller is a merchant in such goods.  While this is a relevant factor, it does not specifically mention the buyer's reliance on the seller's skill or judgment.

Choice c) states that the seller knows the particular purpose for which the buyer will use the goods and knows the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select suitable goods.  This choice is similar to choice a) but does not explicitly state that the seller must know the buyer's reliance on their skill or judgment.

Choice d) states that the seller knows the particular purpose for which the buyer will use the goods and the seller is a merchant in such goods.  This choice combines elements of choices b) and c) but does not fully capture the UCC's criteria regarding the buyer's reliance on the seller's skill or judgment.

"Input: Before accepting an audit engagement a CPA should evaluate whether conditions exist that raise questions as to the integrity of management.  Which of the following conditions most likely would raise such questions?  Choices: a) There are significant differences between the entity's forecasted financial statements and the financial statements to be audited.  b) The CPA will not be permitted to have access to sensitive information regarding the salaries of senior management.  c) There have been substantial inventory write-offs just before the year end in each of the past four years.  d) The CPA becomes aware of the existence of related party transactions while reading the draft financial statements.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider which condition would raise questions about the integrity of management.  This means looking for situations where management might be manipulating financial results or engaging in unethical behavior.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice in the context of raising questions about management's integrity.
 a) Significant differences between forecasted and audited financial statements could indicate that management is not being transparent or is attempting to manipulate the financial results.  This could raise questions about the integrity of management.
 b) The CPA not being allowed access to sensitive information about senior management's salaries is a concern,  but it does not necessarily imply that management is engaging in unethical behavior.  It could be a legitimate business decision.
 c) Substantial inventory write-offs just before year-end in each of the past four years could indicate that management is manipulating the financial statements to present better financial results.  This could raise questions about the integrity of management.
 d) The existence of related party transactions is not inherently suspicious and is common in many businesses.  While it is important for the CPA to investigate these transactions,  it does not necessarily raise questions about the integrity of management.

Based on the analysis,  the condition that most likely raises questions about the integrity of management is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: In an e-commerce environment that requires that the information technology (IT) system be available on a continuous basis,  more emphasis will be placed on which of the following aspects of the planning than in a traditional organization?

"Input: Spark Co.  buys cordless phones for $125  each and sells them for $200  each.  Spark pays a sales commission of $25  per phone sold and monthly fixed costs are $3000.  Assuming Spark desired a profit of 10 % of sales how many units must Spark sell?  Choices: a) 600  b) 400  c) 200  d) 100  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the profit Spark wants to make,  which is 10 % of sales.  Let's assume x is the number of phones sold.  The sales revenue is $200  * x.  So the desired profit is 0.10 * ($200  * x) = $20  * x.
 Next,  I need to calculate the total cost.  The variable cost is $125  * x for the cost of the phones and $25  * x for the sales commission.  The total variable cost is $125  * x + $25  * x = $150  * x.
 The fixed costs are $3000.
 The total cost is the sum of the fixed costs and the total variable cost: $3000 + $150  * x.
 To find the break-even point,  I need to set the sales revenue equal to the total cost plus the desired profit: $200  * x = $3000 + $150  * x + $20  * x.
 Simplifying the equation,  I get $200  * x = $3000 + $170  * x.
 Subtracting $170  * x from both sides,  I get $30  * x = $3000.
 Dividing both sides by $30,  I get x = 100.
 Therefore,  Spark must sell 100 units to achieve the desired profit.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Inherent risk and control risk differ from detection risk in which of the following ways?  Choices: a) Inherent risk and control risk are calculated by the client.  b) Inherent risk and control risk exist independently of the audit.  c) Inherent risk and control risk are controlled by the auditor.  d) Inherent risk and control risk exist as a result of the auditor’s judgment about materiality.  
 Output:
 First, let's understand the concepts of inherent risk, control risk, and detection risk in the context of auditing. Inherent risk refers to the possibility of a misstatement in the financial statements due to various factors, which is inherent in the nature of the business and the accounting estimates. Control risk is the risk that a misstatement could occur and go undetected by the entity's internal controls. Detection risk is the risk that the auditor's procedures will not detect a material misstatement in the financial statements.

Now, let's analyze the choices:

a) Inherent risk and control risk are calculated by the client. - This statement is partially correct. Inherent risk is inherent in the business and accounting estimates, which is determined by the client. Control risk is also determined by the client's internal controls. However, the auditor assesses these risks.

b) Inherent risk and control risk exist independently of the audit. - This statement is correct. Inherent risk and control risk are determined by factors outside the audit process and are assessed by the auditor based on their understanding of the client's business and internal controls.

c) Inherent risk and control risk are controlled by the auditor. - This statement is incorrect. The auditor assesses and evaluates inherent risk and control risk, but they do not control them.

d) Inherent risk and control risk exist as a result of the auditor’s judgment about materiality. - This statement is incorrect. Inherent risk and control risk are determined by the client's business and internal controls, not the auditor's judgment about materiality.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Ultra Co.  uses a periodic inventory system.  The following are inventory transactions for the month of January: 1 /1  Beginning inventory 20000  units at $13  1 /20  Purchase 30000  units at $15  1 /23  Purchase 40000  units at $17  1 /31  Sales at $20  per unit 50000  units Ultra uses the LIFO method to determine the value of its inventory.  What amount should Ultra report as cost of goods sold on its income statement for the month of January?  Choices: a) $710,000  b) $750,000  c) $830,000  d) 1000000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the cost of the units sold.  Since Ultra uses the LIFO method,  the most recent purchases are sold first.
 The sales on January 31  are for 50000  units.  Since the most recent purchases are at $17  per unit,  the cost of these units is 50000  * $17  = $850,000.
 However,  the purchase on January 23  only has 40000  units,  so these units are not enough to cover the entire sales.  The remaining units must come from the purchase on January 20.
 The remaining units needed for the sales are 50000  - 40000  = 10000  units.  The cost of these units is 10000  * $15  = $150,000.
 The total cost of goods sold is the sum of the costs of the units sold from the January 23  and January 20  purchases: $850,000  + $150,000  = $1,000,000.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: On day 1,  Jackson,  a merchant,  mailed Sands a signed letter that contained an offer to sell Sands 500  electric fans at $10  per fan.  The letter was received by Sands on day 3.  The letter contained a promise not to revoke the offer but no expiration date.  On day 4,  Jackson mailed Sands a revocation of the offer to sell the fans.  Sands received the revocation on day 6.  On day 7,  Sands mailed Jackson an acceptance of the offer.  Jackson received the acceptance on day 9.  Under the Sales Article of the UCC,  was a contract formed?  Choices: a) No contract was formed because the offer failed to state an expiration date.  b) No contract was formed because Sands received the revocation of the offer before Sands accepted the offer c) A contract was formed on the day Jackson received Sands’ acceptance d) A contract was formed on the day Sands mailed the acceptance to Jackson 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine if the offer was accepted before the revocation arrived.  The offer was made on day 1 and received by Sands on day 3.  The revocation was mailed on day 4 and received by Sands on day 6.  Sands mailed their acceptance on day 7,  and Jackson received it on day 9.
 The key is to see if the revocation arrived before the acceptance.  Since the revocation arrived on day 6 and the acceptance was received on day 9,  the revocation came before the acceptance.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Elan Co.  has two employees.  Each employee receives two weeks of paid vacation each year.  Vacation rights accumulate.  One employee whose weekly salary is $600  took a two-week vacation during the year but the other employee who earns $800  per week took no vacation during the year.  In its year-end financial statements what amount should Elan report as vacation liability and expense?  Liability Expense Choices: a) $1600  $1200  b) $1600  $2800  c) $0  $1200  d) $0  $2800  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the total vacation liability for both employees.  Since each employee is entitled to two weeks of paid vacation,  the total vacation liability is 2  weeks * ($600  + $800)  = 2  * $1400  = $2800.
 Next,  I need to determine the vacation expense for the year.  The employee who took a two-week vacation will incur the expense,  so the vacation expense is 2  weeks * $600  = $1200.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following statements is correct regarding the Federal Unemployment Tax Act?  Choices: a) An employee who resigns regardless of cause is eligible for unemployment benefits.  b) The federal unemployment system is funded by both employer and employee taxes.  c) The Act is intended to assist workers who are permanently out of work and need assistance in supporting themselves.  d) The unemployment insurance system is administered by the states through their employment laws.  
 Output:
 First, let's analyze each statement:
 a) An employee who resigns regardless of cause is eligible for unemployment benefits. This statement is generally true, as employees who resign are typically eligible for unemployment benefits, unless they resign for cause.
 b) The federal unemployment system is funded by both employer and employee taxes. This statement is false. The federal unemployment system is funded solely by employer taxes, not by employee taxes.
 c) The Act is intended to assist workers who are permanently out of work and need assistance in supporting themselves. This statement is partially true. The Act is intended to assist workers who are temporarily out of work, not permanently.
 d) The unemployment insurance system is administered by the states through their employment laws. This statement is false. The unemployment insurance system is administered by the federal government, not by the states.

Based on the analysis, the correct statement is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: When the AQR partnership was formed,  partner Acre contributed land with a fair market value of $100,000  and a tax basis of $60,000  in exchange for a one-third interest in the partnership.  The AQR partnership agreement specifies that each partner will share equally in the partnership’s profits and losses.  During its first year of operation,  AQR sold the land to an unrelated third party for $160,000.  What is the proper tax treatment of the sale?  Choices: a) Each partner reports a capital gain of $33,333.  b) The entire gain of $100,000  must be specifically allocated to Acre.  c) The first $40,000  of gain is allocated to Acre,  and the remaining gain of $60,000  is shared equally by the other two partners.  d) The first $40,000  of gain is allocated to Acre,  and the remaining gain of $60,000  is shared equally by all the partners in the partnership.  
 Output:
 First,  we need to determine the gain on the sale of the land.  The fair market value of the land was $160,000,  and Acre's tax basis was $60,000,  so the gain is $160,000  - $60,000  = $100,000.
 Next,  we need to consider the partnership agreement.  The agreement specifies that each partner will share equally in the partnership's profits and losses.  Since the gain is a profit,  it should be shared equally among the partners.
 Now,  we need to consider Acre's specific contribution to the partnership.  Acre contributed land with a tax basis of $60,000,  which is less than the total gain of $100,000.  This means that Acre's share of the gain is limited to his tax basis,  which is $40,000.
 The remaining gain of $60,000  should be shared equally by the other two partners.  So,  Acre reports a capital gain of $40,000,  and each of the other two partners reports a capital gain of $30,000.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The purpose of establishing quality control policies and procedures for deciding whether to accept or continue a client relationship is to Choices: a) Provide reasonable assurance that personnel are adequately trained to fulfill their responsibilities.  b) Minimize the likelihood of associating with clients whose management lacks integrity.  c) Document the matters that are required to be communicated to the audit committee.  d) Enhance the auditor's understanding of the client's business and its industry.  
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the purpose of quality control policies and procedures in the context of deciding whether to accept or continue a client relationship.  These policies and procedures are established to ensure that the auditor can perform their duties effectively and in accordance with professional standards.

Next,  we need to consider the options provided and determine which one best aligns with the purpose of these policies and procedures.  Option a) focuses on personnel training, which is important but not the primary purpose of these policies. Option c) relates to communication with the audit committee, which is a part of the overall quality control framework but not the main purpose. Option d) relates to the auditor's understanding of the client's business, which is important for effective auditing but not the primary purpose of these policies and procedures.

Option b) states that the purpose is to minimize the likelihood of associating with clients whose management lacks integrity. This option directly addresses the need to ensure that the auditor only works with clients that have a strong ethical foundation and management integrity. This is a critical aspect of maintaining the independence and credibility of the auditor's work.

"Input: What is the price of a five-year bond (face value $100 ) that pays no coupons,  if its yield is 4 %?  Choices: a) $100  b) $85  c) $82  d) $75  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider that this is a zero-coupon bond,  meaning it pays no coupons.  The only payment is the face value at maturity.
 The yield of the bond is 4 %,  which means the annual interest rate is 4 %.
 To find the price of the bond,  I need to discount the face value to the present value using the yield as the discount rate.
 The formula for the present value of a future cash flow is P = F / (1 + r)^n,  where P is the present value,  F is the future cash flow (face value),  r is the discount rate,  and n is the number of periods.
 In this case,  F = $100,  r = 0.04,  and n = 5.
 Plugging in the values,  I get P = 100 / (1 + 0.04)^5 = 100 / 1.2167 = $82.19 (rounded to two decimal places).
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Vital Corp.  is an accrual-basis calendar-year C corporation.  Its year 2  reported book income before federal income taxes was $500000.  Included in that amount were the following items: Year 1  state franchise tax refund $50000  Municipal bond interest income 7500  What should be the amount of Vital's year 2  taxable income as reconciled on Vital's Schedule M-1  of Form 1120  U. S.  Corporation Income Tax Return?  Choices: a) $500,000  b) $492,500  c) $450,000  d) 442500  
 Output:
 First,  I need to adjust the book income for the state franchise tax refund.  Since this is a refund of taxes paid in the previous year,  it is not taxable income and should be subtracted from the book income.  So,  the adjusted income is $500,000 - $50,000 = $450,000.
 Next,  I need to consider the municipal bond interest income.  This is tax-exempt income and should also be subtracted from the book income.  So,  the final taxable income is $450,000 - $7,500 = $442,500.

 First,  I need to consider the nature of the change in accounting principles.  In this case,  the change is not material to the comparability of the financial statements.
 Next,  I need to consider the auditor's responsibilities when there is a change in accounting principles.  The auditor's responsibility is to evaluate the change and communicate it appropriately in the auditor's report.
 Finally,  I need to consider the options given.  Option a) does not require the auditor to communicate the change,  which is not in line with the auditor's responsibilities.  Option b) suggests referring to the note in the financial statements,  which is appropriate for communicating the change to the users of the financial statements.  Option c) suggests using an emphasis-of-matter paragraph,  which is typically used for more significant changes or issues.  Option d) requires the auditor to explicitly state whether the change conforms with GAAP,  which is not necessary in this case since the change is not material.

Long conducted business on the Internet and had little contact with Frost.  After Frost was declared incompetent in a judicial proceeding,  Long placed an order with Grant Corp.  on Frost's behalf.  Both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence.  Will Frost or Frost's legal representative be liable to Grant?  Choices: a) Yes,  because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.  b) Yes,  because the order was valid regardless of Frost's incompetence.  c) No,  because Grant dealt only with Long.  d) No,  because Long did not have authority to enter into the contract.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the legal principle that an agency relationship can survive the principal's incompetence.  In this case,  Long had express authority to place purchase orders with Frost's suppliers,  and Long's agency relationship with Frost was not terminated by Frost's incompetence.
 Next,  I need to consider the validity of the order placed by Long on Frost's behalf.  The order was valid because Long had the necessary authority to enter into the contract on Frost's behalf,  and both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence.

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the question,  which is about the procedures an auditor would perform before examining the balance sheet.
 Next,  I need to consider the order of auditing procedures.  The auditor typically starts by obtaining an understanding of the client's internal control activities (b), as this helps in planning the audit and identifying areas of risk.
 Then,  the auditor would perform specific substantive procedures, such as confirming with the client's lawyer that all litigation probable of assertion has been disclosed to the auditor (a), determining whether there are any liens or encumbrances on assets that have been pledged as collateral (c), and considering the client's plans and ability to meet imminent purchase commitments and cash flow obligations (d).

 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the present value of the future cash flows.  The future cash flow is $2  million in five years,  and the discount rate is 10 %.
 To calculate the present value,  I use the formula: PV = FV / (1 + r)^n, where PV is the present value,  FV is the future value,  r is the discount rate,  and n is the number of periods.
 In this case,  FV = $2  million,  r = 10 % = 0.1,  and n = 5 years.
 So,  the present value of the future cash flows is $2  million / (1 + 0.1)^5 = $2  million / 1.61051 = $1,242,000.
 Next,  I need to calculate the net present value (NPV).  NPV is the present value of the future cash flows minus the initial investment.
 In this case,  the initial investment is $1  million.
 So,  the NPV is $1,242,000 - $1  million = $242,000.

"Input: Brown cosigned Royal's $50000  note to State Bank.  If Royal is later adjudicated mentally incompetent what would be Brown's liability on the note?  Choices: a) Liable to pay State on the due date of the note.  b) Liable to pay State only if State first seeks payment from Royal.  c) Not liable to pay State because Royal's incompetency discharges Royal as a surety.  d) Not liable to pay State unless Brown was a compensated surety.  
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the nature of cosigning a note.  Cosigning means that Brown is jointly and severally liable for the payment of the note,  along with Royal.
 Next,  we consider the situation where Royal is adjudicated mentally incompetent.  This does not discharge Royal's liability on the note,  as the surety (Brown) is still responsible for the payment.
 Finally,  we evaluate the choices given.  Choice a) states that Brown is liable to pay State on the due date of the note,  which is consistent with the joint and several liability established by cosigning.

The recognition of rental expense for the new offices should begin in which of the following months?  Choices: a) January.  b) March.  c) May.  d) July.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine when the company gains control of the property for leasehold improvements.  The company gains control on January 1.
 Next,  I need to consider when the leasehold improvements are completed and the company's staff moves in.  The company's staff moves in on May 1.
 The leasehold improvements are made to customize the property for the company's use,  so the company should recognize the rental expense based on the period it has control of the property for its own use.
 Therefore,  the company should recognize the rental expense beginning in May.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following circumstances most likely would cause an auditor to suspect that there are material misstatements in an entity's financial statements?  Choices: a) There are unusual discrepancies between the entity's records and confirmation replies.  b) Management enforces strict budgetary controls over the entity's departmental supervisors.  c) Cash transactions are electronically processed and recorded leaving no paper audit trail.  d) The monthly bank reconciliation ordinarily includes several large outstanding checks.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the circumstances that could indicate potential issues with the financial statements.  An auditor would be concerned if there are significant discrepancies between the entity's records and external confirmations, as this could suggest errors or fraud.
 Next,  I will evaluate the other choices.  Management enforcing strict budgetary controls is a positive sign, as it indicates a commitment to financial integrity.  Cash transactions being electronically processed and leaving no paper trail might seem like a good thing, but it also raises concerns about the absence of a physical audit trail, which is typically preferred for verification purposes.  The presence of several large outstanding checks in the bank reconciliation is not inherently suspicious, as these checks may simply be part of normal business operations.
 Based on these evaluations,  the circumstance most likely to cause an auditor to suspect material misstatements is the presence of unusual discrepancies between the entity's records and confirmation replies.

"Input: A taxpayer purchases and is the owner of an insurance contract on his own life and designates his two children as equal beneficiaries.  The taxpayer makes all premium payments.  How many gifts of property,  if any,  have been made for gift tax purposes?  Choices: a) Zero.  b) One.  c) Two.  d) Three.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the definition of a gift for gift tax purposes.  A gift is made when one person transfers property to another with the intention of giving the property away permanently.
 Next,  I need to consider the taxpayer's actions in this scenario.  The taxpayer purchases an insurance contract on his own life and designates his two children as equal beneficiaries.  The taxpayer also makes all premium payments.
 Now,  I need to determine if a gift has been made.  The taxpayer's action of purchasing the insurance contract and designating his children as beneficiaries does not constitute a gift for gift tax purposes.  The taxpayer remains the owner of the contract and the children are beneficiaries, not recipients of property.

"Input: The City of Windemere decided to construct several large windmills to generate electrical power.  The construction was financed through a general residential property tax levy for the next ten years.  Utility revenues are intended to offset all expenses associated with the windmills.  The land for the windmills was donated to the city by a local farmer.  The land from the farmer should be reported in which fund type?  Choices: a) Special revenue.  b) Capital projects.  c) Enterprise.  d) Permanent.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the purpose of the land donation.  The land is being used for constructing windmills,  which are a capital investment for the city.  The land is not being used for immediate revenue generation,  so it is not an enterprise fund.
 Next,  I need to consider the source of the funds to finance the windmills.  The construction is financed through a general residential property tax levy,  which means the funds are not specifically designated for the windmills.  Therefore,  it is not a special revenue fund.
 The land is being used for a capital project,  and the funds to finance the project are not specifically designated for the project.  This best fits the description of a capital projects fund.

 First, I need to calculate the gain on the sale of the residence. The gain is the net amount received from the sale minus the cost basis of the house. The net amount is $500,000, and the cost basis is $200,000. So, the gain is $500,000 - $200,000 = $300,000.
 Next, I need to consider the special rules for single taxpayers who sell their principal residence. Since Decker is a single individual and he occupied the house until it was sold, he is eligible for the $250,000 exclusion for single taxpayers.
 To determine the amount of gain Decker should recognize, I subtract the exclusion from the gain: $300,000 - $250,000 = $50,000.

"Input: To which of the following rights is a holder of a public corporation's cumulative preferred stock always entitled?  Choices: a) Conversion of the preferred stock into common stock.  b) Voting rights.  c) Dividend carryovers from years in which dividends were not paid.  d) Guaranteed dividends.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the characteristics of cumulative preferred stock.  Cumulative preferred stock entitles its holders to receive dividends before common stockholders.  If dividends are not paid in a particular year,  they accumulate and must be paid out in future years.
 Now,  I need to consider the given choices and match them with the characteristics of cumulative preferred stock.  a) Conversion of the preferred stock into common stock is not always a right of a holder of cumulative preferred stock,  as it depends on the specific terms of the stock.  b) Voting rights are not typically associated with cumulative preferred stock,  as common stockholders usually have voting rights.  c) Dividend carryovers from years in which dividends were not paid is a characteristic of cumulative preferred stock,  as it allows the accumulated dividends to be paid out in future years.  d) Guaranteed dividends is also a characteristic of cumulative preferred stock,  as the holders are entitled to receive the dividends before common stockholders.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: According to the SEC,  members of an issuer’s audit committee may not Choices: a) Establish procedures for employees to anonymously report fraud.  b) Be responsible for the compensation of any registered public accounting firm employed by the registrant to provide an audit report.  c) Accept any consulting,  advisory,  or other compensatory fee from the registrant for services other than as a member of the board.  d) Engage independent counsel as deemed necessary to carry out their duties.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the role of an issuer's audit committee.  The audit committee is responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process and ensuring that the company's financial statements are accurate and reliable.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given and determine which one is not allowed according to the SEC.  Choice a) is allowed because establishing procedures for employees to report fraud is a responsibility of the audit committee.
 Choice b) is not allowed because the audit committee should not be responsible for the compensation of any registered public accounting firm, as this could create a conflict of interest.
 Choice c) is allowed because accepting consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fees from the registrant is generally not allowed, but as long as it is not for services other than as a member of the board, it is allowed.
 Choice d) is allowed because engaging independent counsel is a responsibility of the audit committee to carry out their duties.

"Input: Order the following (risk,  return) pairs from least to most favourable,  assuming the perspective of a rational and risk-averse investor: (2,2 ), (2,3 ) and (4,2 ).  Risk is measured in standard deviations and return in percentage.  HINT: Imagine a scatter diagram with standard deviation on the x-axis and return on the y-axis.  Choices: a) (4,2 ), (2,2 ), (2,3 ) b) (2,2 ), (2,3 ), (4,2 ) c) (2,2 ), (4,2 ), (2,3 ) d) (2,3 ), (2,2 ), (4,2 ) 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the perspective of a rational and risk-averse investor.  This means that the investor prefers investments with lower risk (standard deviations) and higher returns.
 Next,  I will analyze each pair in terms of risk and return.  (2,2 ) has a risk of 2 standard deviations and a return of 2%.  (2,3 ) has a risk of 2 standard deviations and a return of 3%.  (4,2 ) has a risk of 4 standard deviations and a return of 2%.
 Now,  I will order the pairs based on the investor's preferences.  The pair with the lowest risk and highest return should be at the top, and the pair with the highest risk and lowest return should be at the bottom.
 Based on the analysis,  the order from least to most favourable is (2,2 ), (2,3 ), and (4,2 ).

"Input: Sussman Co.  prepared cash-basis financial statements for the month ended January 31.  A summary of Sussman's January activities follows: Credit sales of $5600.  Collections of $1900  relating to January credit sales.  Accrued salaries of $1200.  By what amount will Sussman's cash-basis income for the month ended January 31  increase as a result of restating these activities to the accrual basis of accounting?  Choices: a) $2,500  b) $3,700  c) $4,400  d) 4900  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the cash-basis income for the month ended January 31.  Cash-basis income is calculated by adding collections to sales: $1900  (collections) + $5600  (sales) = $7500  cash-basis income.
 Next,  I need to consider the accrual basis adjustments.  The accrual basis requires recognizing expenses when they are incurred,  not when they are paid.  So,  the accrual basis income will include the accrued salaries of $1200.
 To find the increase in cash-basis income due to restating to the accrual basis,  I subtract the accrued salaries from the cash-basis income: $7500  - $1200  = $6300.

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the COSO framework for monitoring internal control.  The COSO framework outlines five components for monitoring internal control,  which include establishing a foundation for monitoring,  designing and executing monitoring procedures,  assessing and reporting the results,  including following up on corrective action where necessary,  and increasing the reliability of financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

"Input: A bond issued on June 1,  year 1,  has interest payment dates of April 1  and October 1.  Bond interest expense for the year ended December 31,  year 1,  is for a period of Choices: a) Three months.  b) Four months.  c) Six months.  d) Seven months.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the interest payment dates and the end of the year.  The interest payment dates are April 1  and October 1,  and the end of the year is December 31,  year 1.
 Next,  I need to calculate the time period between the first interest payment date and the end of the year.  The first interest payment date is April 1,  and the end of the year is December 31.
 To find the time period,  I subtract the first date from the second date: December 31 - April 1 = 9 months.
 However,  the bond was issued on June 1,  so the actual time period for the interest expense is 9 months - 1 month = 8 months.

 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the question's focus,  which is the nature of tests in a financial statement audit.  The important consideration here is the relevance and effectiveness of the tests used.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice based on its relevance to the focus of the question.
 a) Tests of details typically provide a low level of assurance.  This choice is relevant because it discusses the level of assurance provided by a specific type of test.
 b) Analytical procedures are an inefficient means of obtaining assurance.  This choice is not relevant because it criticizes a method of obtaining assurance rather than discussing the nature of tests in a financial statement audit.
 c) The procedures to be applied on a particular engagement are a matter of the auditor’s professional judgment.  This choice is relevant because it highlights the role of professional judgment in deciding the nature of tests.
 d) The use of tests of controls should be considered without regard to the level of assurance required.  This choice is relevant because it discusses the consideration of a specific type of test based on the level of assurance required.

After evaluating each choice,  I can conclude that the important considerations when deciding the nature of tests to use in a financial statement audit are choices a) and c).  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'ac'}"

Choices: a) Studio terminated as of January 1.  b) Studio terminated as of April 9.  c) Studio terminated as of December 31.  d) Studio did not terminate.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the tax implications of a partner selling their interest to another partner within the same partnership.  In this case,  Stone sold his interest to Taylor.
 Second,  I need to consider the definition of a partnership.  A partnership is a legal entity formed by two or more people who contribute capital,  property,  or skills to a business venture with a profit-sharing agreement.
 Third,  I need to analyze the effect of Stone's sale on the partnership's status.  Stone's sale does not change the fact that the partners are still engaged in a business venture with a profit-sharing agreement.

"Input: Which of the following is a major difference between the just-in-time (JIT) and traditional approaches to manufacturing?  Choices: a) The JIT approach usually involves a large number of suppliers while traditional approaches usually involve only a small number of suppliers.  b) The JIT approach requires centralized purchasing while traditional approaches encourage purchasing decisions by production employees.  c) The JIT approach uses a push-through system while traditional approaches use a pull-through system.  d) The JIT approach operates with low inventory levels while traditional approaches may operate with high inventory levels.  
 Output:
 First, let's understand the key differences between the just-in-time (JIT) and traditional approaches to manufacturing.

JIT manufacturing is focused on minimizing waste and improving efficiency by producing goods only when they are needed. It relies on a pull-through system, where production is triggered by customer demand, rather than a push-through system where production is based on forecasts. JIT also involves a large number of suppliers who work closely together to ensure that materials are delivered just in time for production.

Traditional manufacturing, on the other hand, operates with high inventory levels, as it is based on forecasts and may not rely as heavily on supplier collaboration. Traditional approaches may involve a smaller number of suppliers and may have centralized purchasing decisions made by production employees.

Comparing the choices given:

a) This statement is true for JIT, as it involves a large number of suppliers. However, it is not a major difference between JIT and traditional approaches, as traditional approaches can also involve multiple suppliers.

b) This statement is true for traditional approaches, as they may encourage purchasing decisions by production employees. However, it is not a major difference between JIT and traditional approaches, as JIT relies on supplier collaboration rather than centralized purchasing.

c) This statement is true for JIT, as it uses a pull-through system. However, it is not a major difference between JIT and traditional approaches, as traditional approaches use a push-through system.

d) This statement is true for JIT, as it operates with low inventory levels. This is a major difference between JIT and traditional approaches, as traditional approaches may operate with high inventory levels.

"Input: On January 1,  year 1,  a company purchased equipment for $100  million.  The equipment consists of four major components,  of which two components comprise 80 % of the total cost and each has a 20 -year useful life.  The remaining two components have costs of $10  million each; one of them has a useful life of four years,  and the other has a useful life of five years.  The company applies the cost model to the equipment and uses the straight-line method of depreciation.  Under IFRS,  what is the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31,  year 1?  Choices: a) $4,000,000  b) $5,000,000  c) $8,000,000  d) $8,500,000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the depreciation expense for the two major components that comprise 80 % of the total cost.  Since each of these components has a useful life of 20  years and the total cost is $100  million,  the cost of each component is $100  million * 0.8 / 2 = $40  million.
 Using the straight-line method,  the depreciation expense for each of these components is $40  million ÷ 20  years = $2  million per year.
 So,  the total depreciation expense for these two components is $2  million * 2 = $4  million.
 Next,  I need to calculate the depreciation expense for the remaining two components.  The first component has a cost of $10  million and a useful life of four years,  so the depreciation expense is $10  million ÷ 4  years = $2.5  million per year.
 The second component has a cost of $10  million and a useful life of five years,  so the depreciation expense is $10  million ÷ 5  years = $2  million per year.
 The total depreciation expense for these two components is $2.5  million + $2  million = $4.5  million.
 To find the total depreciation expense for the year ended December 31,  year 1,  I add the depreciation expenses for the two groups of components: $4  million + $4.5  million = $8.5  million.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

The information technology governance committee is designing a new enterprise-wide system and needs to determine whether the current fixed asset process should be included because the current system seems to be working properly.  What long-term solution should the committee recommend?  Choices: a) Continuing to use the current spreadsheet process because there have been no issues in this area.  b) Developing a new fixed asset system to manage the assets and related depreciation c) Purchasing a stand-alone fixed asset program for managing the assets and related depreciation d) Adopting the fixed asset module of the new system for integration.  
 Output:
 First,  the committee should consider the long-term implications of continuing to use the current spreadsheet process.  While the current system may be working properly,  it is not scalable and lacks the features and security of a modern enterprise system.
 Next,  the committee should evaluate the new enterprise-wide system's fixed asset module.  If the module is comprehensive,  secure,  and can integrate with other systems,  it would be a viable long-term solution.
 Finally,  the committee should consider the cost and resources required to develop a new fixed asset system or purchase a stand-alone program.  If the new system's module meets their needs and is within budget,  it would be the most efficient solution.

"Input: In selecting an appropriate sample for a substantive test the auditor most likely would stratify the population if the Choices: a) Auditor suspects that management fraud has occurred during the year.  b) Desired assessed level of control risk is less than the prior year.  c) Technique to be used is attribute sampling.  d) Auditor plans to give greater representation to large recorded amounts.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the purpose of stratification in selecting a sample for a substantive test.  Stratification is a technique used to divide the population into homogeneous subgroups, or strata,  to increase the precision of the sample.
 Next,  I need to consider each choice and determine which one is most likely to result in stratification.  a) Auditor suspects that management fraud has occurred during the year.  This could lead to stratification if the auditor believes that the fraud has affected specific subgroups within the population.  b) Desired assessed level of control risk is less than the prior year.  This choice does not directly relate to the need for stratification.  c) Technique to be used is attribute sampling.  Attribute sampling is a type of sampling technique,  but it does not inherently require stratification.  d) Auditor plans to give greater representation to large recorded amounts.  This choice suggests that the auditor wants to focus more on larger amounts within the population,  which could be achieved through stratification by size.

The right Choices: a) Is absolute.  b) Is conditioned upon the demanding shareholder owning at least $5000  worth of stock.  c) Requires that the demand to inspect be for a proper purpose.  d) Exists only when fraud or illegality is alleged.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the options given and evaluate their validity.  Option a) states that the right is absolute,  which means it is not subject to any conditions.  However,  this is not correct,  as the right to inspect corporate books and records is not absolute.
 Option b) suggests that the right is conditioned upon the demanding shareholder owning at least $5000  worth of stock.  This is also not correct,  as the right to inspect is not contingent upon the shareholder's ownership stake.
 Option c) states that the right requires that the demand to inspect be for a proper purpose.  This is the correct statement,  as the right to inspect corporate books and records is subject to the requirement that the demand be for a proper purpose.
 Option d) claims that the right exists only when fraud or illegality is alleged.  This is not correct,  as the right to inspect is not limited to situations involving fraud or illegality.

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the role of a CPA when reviewing the financial statements of a nonissuer.  A CPA's primary responsibility is to provide an independent examination of the financial statements to the users of the information.
 Next,  I need to consider the options provided and determine which one is consistent with the CPA's role.  Option a) involves making inquiries about cash balances, which is a part of the audit process.  Option b) communicates deficiencies to the audit committee, which is not the CPA's responsibility.  Option c) examines trend analysis to assess detection risk, which is relevant to the audit process.  Option d) evaluates management's plans for dealing with financial difficulties, which is also relevant to the audit process.

 First, I need to identify the AMT tax preference items. The AMT tax preference items include long-term capital gains, dividends from publicly-held companies, and the excess of percentage depletion over the property's adjusted basis.

Next, I calculate the long-term capital gains, which are not subject to the AMT, so they do not contribute to the AMT tax preference items.

Then, I calculate the dividends from publicly-held companies, which are also not subject to the AMT, so they do not contribute to the AMT tax preference items.

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of present value.  The present value is the current value of future cash flows,  discounted at a certain rate.  If the present value is greater than the initial investment,  it means that the project generates more value than the cost of the investment.
 Next,  I need to consider the options given.  Option a) states that the project should be accepted if the present value is equal to the initial investment,  which does not necessarily mean that the project is profitable.  Option b) states that the project should be accepted if the present value is less than the initial investment,  which is not logical because it would mean that the project is losing value.  Option d) states that the project should be accepted if the present value is equal to zero,  which means that the project generates no value.
 Finally,  option c) states that the project should be accepted if the present value is greater than the initial investment,  which is the correct answer because it means that the project generates more value than the cost of the investment.

"Input: Gulde’s tax basis in Chyme Partnership was $26,000  at the time Gulde received a liquidating distribution of $12,000  cash and land with an adjusted basis to Chyme of $10,000  and a fair market value of $30,000.  Chyme did not have unrealized receivables,  appreciated inventory,  or properties that had been contributed by its partners.  What was the amount of Gulde’s basis in the land?  Choices: a) $0  b) $10,000  c) $14,000  d) $30,000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the amount of the distribution that is attributable to the cash and the land.  Since the total distribution is $12,000  cash + $30,000  land,  the total distribution value is $42,000.
 Next,  I need to allocate the original basis of $26,000  to the cash and land based on their respective values.  The cash is worth $12,000  and the land is worth $30,000,  so the total value of the distribution is $42,000.
 The allocation ratio for the cash is $12,000  ÷ $42,000  = 0.2857, and the allocation ratio for the land is $30,000  ÷ $42,000  = 0.7143.
 Now,  I apply these allocation ratios to Gulde's original basis of $26,000.  The cash portion of the basis is $26,000  * 0.2857  ≈ $7,430, and the land portion of the basis is $26,000  * 0.7143  ≈ $18,570.
 Since the land had an adjusted basis to Chyme of $10,000,  Gulde's basis in the land is the higher of the adjusted basis or the allocated basis, which is $18,570.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

In Verity's statement of cash flows what amount should it report as net cash used in investing activities?  Choices: a) $0  b) $150,000  c) $200,000  d) 250000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the cash flows related to investing activities.  In this case,  the purchase of Otra Co.  bonds and U. S.  Treasury bills are both investing activities.
 The purchase of Otra Co.  bonds is a cash outflow of $200000.
 The purchase of U. S.  Treasury bills is also a cash outflow,  but since they are classified as cash equivalents,  they are not included in the investing activities section of the statement of cash flows.
 Therefore,  the net cash used in investing activities is only the cash outflow for the Otra Co.  bonds,  which is $200000.

Choices: a) Disagreements between the predecessor auditor and management as to significant accounting policies and principles.  b) The predecessor auditor’s understanding of the reasons for the change of auditors c) Facts known to the predecessor auditor that might bear on the integrity of management.  d) Matters that may facilitate the evaluation of financial reporting consistency between the current and prior years.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the purpose of a successor auditor asking for information from the predecessor auditor.  The predecessor auditor has already reviewed the financial statements and provided an opinion on them.  The successor auditor is taking over the engagement and needs to understand the context and any potential issues that may affect their audit.

Next,  I need to consider the choices given and which one is most relevant to the successor auditor's needs.  Choice a) is important because it helps the successor auditor understand any significant differences in accounting policies and principles that may affect the financial statements.  Choice b) is also important because it helps the successor auditor understand the reasons for the change in auditors, which may impact their audit approach.  Choice c) is relevant because it helps the successor auditor assess the integrity of management, which is a key component of the audit.  Choice d) is relevant because it helps the successor auditor evaluate the consistency of financial reporting between the current and prior years, which is a requirement of auditing standards.

However,  the question asks for the information that the successor auditor would ask the predecessor auditor to provide after accepting an audit engagement.  This means the information should be relevant to the successor auditor's initial planning and approach to the audit.  Choice d) is the most relevant to the successor auditor's initial planning and approach, as it directly relates to their evaluation of financial reporting consistency between the current and prior years.

 First,  I need to determine the current liabilities,  which are the debts due within one year.  The line of credit is $250,000  and the balloon note is $300,000,  so the total current liabilities are $250,000  + $300,000  = $500,000.
 Next,  I need to determine the long-term liabilities,  which are the debts due beyond one year.  The secured note is due in five annual installments,  so it is considered a long-term liability.  The total long-term liabilities are the remaining balance of the secured note,  which is $750,000  - $250,000  = $500,000,  plus the balloon note of $300,000,  for a total of $500,000  + $300,000  = $800,000.

"Input: Grant Co. 's sales budget shows the following projections for the year ending December 31 : Quarter Units First 30000  Second 40000  Third 22500  Fourth 27500  Total 120000  Inventory at the beginning of the year was budgeted at 9000  units.  The quantity of finished goods inventory at the end of each quarter is to equal 30 % of the next quarter's budgeted sales of units.  What amount should the production budget show for units to be produced during the first quarter?  Choices: a) 36000  b) 33000  c) 24000  d) 12000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the desired ending inventory for the first quarter.  The desired ending inventory is 30 % of the next quarter's budgeted sales,  which is 30 % of 40000  units = 12000  units.
 Next,  I need to calculate the total units needed for the first quarter by adding the budgeted sales for the first quarter to the desired ending inventory.  So,  30000  units (sales) + 12000  units (desired ending inventory) = 42000  units.
 Now,  I need to subtract the beginning inventory from the total units needed to find the amount of units that should be produced during the first quarter.  So,  42000  units (total units needed) - 9000  units (beginning inventory) = 33000  units.

"Input: Johnson worked for ABC Co.  and earned a salary of $100,000.  Johnson also received,  as a fringe benefit,  group termlife insurance at twice Johnson’s salary.  The annual IRS established uniform cost of insurance is $2.76  per $1,000.  What amount must Johnson include in gross income?  Choices: a) $100,000  b) $100,276  c) $100,414  d) $100,552  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the value of the fringe benefit,  which is group term life insurance at twice Johnson's salary.  So,  the fringe benefit is 2 * $100,000  = $200,000.
 Next,  I need to calculate the cost of the fringe benefit based on the IRS established uniform cost of insurance.  The cost is $2.76  per $1,000,  so for $200,000,  the cost is ($200,000  / $1,000) * $2.76  = 200 * $2.76  = $552.
 Now,  I need to determine the amount that Johnson must include in gross income.  This is the fringe benefit value minus the cost of the fringe benefit: $200,000  - $552  = $199,448.
 However,  the IRS requires that the amount included in gross income cannot be less than the cost of the fringe benefit.  Since $199,448  < $552,  the amount included in gross income is $552.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Vale is a 50 % partner in Ball Partnership.  Vale's tax basis in Ball on January 2  year 1  was $60000.  Ball did not have unrealized receivables appreciated inventory or properties that had been contributed by its partners.  On December 31  year 1  Ball made a $10000  nonliquidating cash distribution to each partner.  The Ball Partnership income tax return reported the following items for year 1 : Tax-exempt interest income $80000  Dividend income 12000  What total amount of gross income from Ball should be included in Vale's year 1  adjusted gross income?  Choices: a) $6,000  b) $16,000  c) $36,000  d) 46000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the total income reported by Ball Partnership for year 1.  The income includes tax-exempt interest income and dividend income: $80000  + $12000  = $92000.
 Next,  I need to consider the nonliquidating cash distribution made by Ball to each partner.  Since Vale is a 50% partner,  the distribution affects Vale's share of the income.  The distribution is $10000  per partner,  so Vale's share is $10000  * 50% = $5000.
 To find the total gross income from Ball included in Vale's year 1  adjusted gross income,  I subtract Vale's share of the distribution from the total income reported by Ball: $92000  - $5000  = $87000.

"Input: While performing an audit of the financial statements of a company for the year ended December 31,  year 1,  the auditor notes that the company’s sales increased substantially in December,  year 1,  with a corresponding decrease in January,  year 2.  In assessing the risk of fraudulent financial reporting or misappropriation of assets,  what should be the auditor’s initial indication about the potential for fraud in sales revenue?  Choices: a) There is a broad indication of misappropriation of assets.  b) There is an indication of theft of the entity’s assets.  c) There is an indication of embezzling receipts.  d) There is a broad indication of financial reporting fraud.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the unusual pattern of sales revenue.  The sales increased substantially in December,  year 1,  and then decreased in January,  year 2.
 Next,  I need to consider the potential reasons for this pattern.  One possible reason is that there was fraudulent financial reporting or misappropriation of assets.
 Finally,  I need to match the potential reasons with the given choices.  The unusual pattern of sales revenue suggests that there may be a broad indication of financial reporting fraud.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: If a warrant carries a right to buy one share of common stock and is exercisable at $20  per common share while the market price of a share is $30,  the theoretical value of the warrant is: Choices: a) $20.00  b) $10.00  c) $5.00  d) $0.00  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of a warrant.  A warrant is a security that gives the holder the right,  but not the obligation,  to buy a certain number of shares of stock at a specified price,  known as the exercise price,  before the warrant expires.
 In this case,  the exercise price is $20  per share,  and the market price of the share is $30.
 The theoretical value of a warrant is the difference between the market price of the stock and the exercise price,  since that is the amount the warrant holder would save by exercising the warrant instead of buying the stock on the open market.
 So,  the theoretical value of the warrant is $30  - $20  = $10.00.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following sampling methods would an auditor use to estimate a numerical measurement of a population such as the dollar value of inventory?  Choices: a) Variable sampling.  b) Discovery sampling.  c) Attribute sampling.  d) Random-number sampling.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the purpose of the sampling method.  The auditor wants to estimate a numerical measurement of the population,  specifically the dollar value of inventory.
 Next,  I need to consider the characteristics of the sampling methods.  Variable sampling is used when the population items have different monetary values,  and the auditor is interested in estimating the total monetary value.
 Discovery sampling is used when the auditor is looking for specific items or patterns,  not estimating the total value.  Attribute sampling is used when the auditor is interested in the proportion of items that have a certain characteristic,  not estimating the total value.  Random-number sampling is a method of selecting a sample based on random numbers,  which can be used for variable sampling.
 Based on the purpose of the sampling method,  the auditor should use variable sampling,  as it is designed to estimate the total monetary value of the population.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

 First,  I need to understand the context of the question.  The question is about the risks of using potentially incorrect end-user developed files in an organization.
 Next,  I need to analyze the choices given.  The choices are:
 a) Management places the same degree of reliance on the files as they do on files generated from mainframe systems.
 b) Management receives limited information for decision making due to a lack of flexibility in EUC files.
 c) Management is unable to respond to competitive pressures quickly.
 d) Management continues to incur additional cost because it takes more hours to do the tasks using EUC.

"Input: Which of the following events most likely would indicate the existence of related party transactions?  Choices: a) Insuring the lives of key executives and listing the entity as beneficiary.  b) Selling real estate at a price that differs significantly from its appraised value.  c) Making a loan with specific scheduled terms for repayment of the funds.  d) Granting stock options to key executives at favorable prices.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the events that could indicate related party transactions.  Related party transactions are agreements between parties that are closely related,  such as family members,  employees,  or companies owned by the same person or group.
 Next,  I will analyze each choice to see if it fits the definition of a related party transaction.
 a) Insuring the lives of key executives and listing the entity as beneficiary.  This could be seen as a related party transaction if the entity listing itself as beneficiary is owned or controlled by the key executives.
 b) Selling real estate at a price that differs significantly from its appraised value.  This could indicate a related party transaction if the seller and buyer are closely related.
 c) Making a loan with specific scheduled terms for repayment of the funds.  This is a general transaction and does not necessarily indicate a related party transaction.
 d) Granting stock options to key executives at favorable prices.  This could be seen as a related party transaction if the stock options are granted at prices significantly lower than the market value,  and the key executives have significant influence over the company.

"Input: Which of the following explanations most likely would satisfy an auditor who questions management about significant debits to accumulated depreciation accounts in the current year?  Choices: a) Prior years’ depreciation expenses were erroneously understated.  b) Current year’s depreciation expense was erroneously understated.  c) The estimated remaining useful lives of plant assets were revised upward.  d) Plant assets were retired during the current year.  
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the context.  Accumulated depreciation accounts are affected by changes in depreciation expenses and the retirement of plant assets.  Significant debits to these accounts would indicate an increase in depreciation expenses or the retirement of assets.

Next,  we can eliminate options that do not fit the context.  Option a) refers to prior years,  which does not explain current year's debits.  Option b) suggests understatement of depreciation,  which would result in a decrease,  not an increase,  in accumulated depreciation.

Now,  we are left with options c) and d).  Option c) refers to an upward revision of estimated remaining useful lives,  which would lead to an increase in depreciation expenses and thus a debit to accumulated depreciation.  Option d) refers to the retirement of plant assets,  which would also result in a debit to accumulated depreciation as the assets are removed from the books.

Both options c) and d) are plausible explanations.  However,  option c) is more likely to result in significant debits to accumulated depreciation accounts if the revision is substantial,  as it directly affects the current year's depreciation expense.  Option d) would result in a debit to accumulated depreciation,  but it is a one-time event and may not necessarily result in significant debits.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Zokro a nongovernmental not-for-profit organization uses the indirect method to prepare its statement of cash flows.  In determining its net cash provided (used) by operating activities Sokro must add back which of the following to the change in net assets?  Choices: a) Purchase of equipment.  b) Payment on long-term debt.  c) Depreciation.  d) Decrease in accounts payable.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what the indirect method is.  The indirect method starts with net income and adjusts it for non-cash items and changes in working capital to determine cash flow from operating activities.
 Next,  I need to identify which of the choices is a non-cash item or a change in working capital.  a) Purchase of equipment is an investing activity.  b) Payment on long-term debt is a financing activity.  d) Decrease in accounts payable is a decrease in working capital.
 The only choice that is a non-cash item is c) Depreciation,  which is added back to net income to calculate cash flow from operating activities.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A company’s new time clock process requires hourly employees to select an identification number and then choose the clock-in or clock-out button.  A video camera captures an image of the employee using the system.  Which of the following exposures can the new system be expected to change the least?  Choices: a) Fraudulent reporting of employees’ own hours.  b) Errors in employees’ overtime computation c) Inaccurate accounting of employees’ hours.  d) Recording of other employees’ hours.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the purpose of the new time clock process.  The goal is to accurately track and record employees' hours worked,  and to prevent any fraudulent activities.
 Next,  I need to analyze each choice and see how the new system can affect it.
 a) Fraudulent reporting of employees’ own hours: The new system requires an identification number selection and a clock-in/clock-out button choice,  which adds an extra layer of security.  It is less likely for an employee to successfully fake their own hours due to the added verification process.
 b) Errors in employees’ overtime computation: The new system does not directly affect the computation of overtime,  so it can be expected to change this aspect the least.
 c) Inaccurate accounting of employees’ hours: The new system aims to improve the accuracy of employee hours accounting,  so it is not expected to change this aspect the least.
 d) Recording of other employees’ hours: The new system requires the employee to select their own identification number and clock-in/clock-out button,  which makes it less likely for someone to record another employee's hours.

"Input: A CPA prepared a tax return that involved a tax shelter transaction that was disclosed on the return.  In which of the following situations would a tax return preparer penalty not be applicable?  Choices: a) There was substantial authority for the position.  b) It is reasonable to believe that the position would more likely that not be upheld.  c) There was a reasonable possibility of success for the position.  d) There was a reasonable basis for the position.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the conditions under which a tax return preparer penalty is not applicable.  The penalty is generally applicable if the tax return preparer knowingly or intentionally prepares a return or claim for refund that fails to include a position that is known or clearly indicated to the return preparer to be incorrect.
 Next,  I need to consider each choice and determine if it meets the conditions for not being subject to the penalty.
 a) If there was substantial authority for the position,  it means that there are authoritative sources that support the position.  This could be a reason for not applying the penalty.
 b) If it is reasonable to believe that the position would more likely than not be upheld,  it means that there is a significant chance the position is correct.  This could also be a reason for not applying the penalty.
 c) If there was a reasonable possibility of success for the position,  it means that there is a chance,  but not a significant one,  that the position is correct.  This is not a strong enough reason to not apply the penalty.
 d) If there was a reasonable basis for the position,  it means that the position has some foundation,  but it is not necessarily strong.  This is not a strong enough reason to not apply the penalty.

"Input: Ace Co.  issued 1000  shares of its $10  par value common stock for $15  per share in cash.  How should this transaction be reported in Ace's statement of cash flows for the year of issuance?  Choices: a) $15000  cash inflow from financing activities.  b) $10000  cash inflow from financing activities and $5000  adjustment to arrive at cash flows from operating activities.  c) $15000  cash flow from investing activities.  d) $10000  cash flow from investing activities and $5000  adjustment to arrive at cash flows from operating activities.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the total cash received from the stock issuance.  The company issued 1000  shares at $15  per share,  so the total cash received is 1000  * $15  = $15000.
 This transaction is related to the company's capital structure,  so it should be reported as a cash inflow from financing activities.

"Input: Toft Co.  had 120000  shares of common stock outstanding at January 1.  On April 1  it issued 40000  additional shares of common stock.  Outstanding all year were 10000  shares of nonconvertible preferred stock on which a dividend of $5  per share was declared during the year.  Net income for the year was $480000.  What should Toft report as earnings per share for the year?  Choices: a) $2.69  b) $2.87  c) $3.00  d) 3.2  
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. At the beginning of the year, there were 120,000 shares outstanding for the entire year. On April 1, an additional 40,000 shares were issued, so these shares were outstanding for 9 months of the year. To calculate the weighted average, I multiply the number of shares by the fraction of the year they were outstanding: (120,000 * 12/12) + (40,000 * 9/12) = 120,000 + 30,000 = 150,000 shares.

Next, I need to adjust the net income for the preferred dividends. The preferred stock had 10,000 shares with a $5 dividend per share, so the total preferred dividends are 10,000 * $5 = $50,000.

Now, I subtract the preferred dividends from the net income to find the income available to common shareholders: $480,000 - $50,000 = $430,000.

Finally, I divide the income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding to find the earnings per share: $430,000 ÷ 150,000 = $2.87.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Smile Inc.  purchased a computer on May 1  for $12000  with an estimated salvage value of $1500  and a 3 -year life.  What is the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31  using the double-declining method of depreciation?  Choices: a) $8,000  b) $7,000  c) $5,333  d) 4667  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the annual depreciation rate using the double-declining method.  The formula is (2 ÷ Useful life) * 100%.  In this case,  the useful life is 3  years,  so the annual depreciation rate is (2 ÷ 3) * 100% = 66.67%.
 Next,  I need to calculate the depreciation expense for the full year.  The formula is Depreciable cost * Depreciation rate.  The depreciable cost is the cost of the computer minus the salvage value: $12000  - $1500  = $10500.  The depreciation expense for the full year is $10500  * 66.67% = $7000.
 However,  the question asks for the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31,  which is only 8  months.  To adjust for the partial year,  I divide the full-year depreciation expense by 12  months and multiply by 8  months: $7000  ÷ 12  * 8  = $4667.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: During an engagement to review the financial statements of a nonissuer,  an accountant becomes aware of several leases that should be capitalized,  but are not capitalized.  The accountant considers these leases to be material to the financial statements.  The accountant decides to modify the standard review report because management will not capitalize the leases.  Under these circumstances,  the accountant should Choices: a) Issue an adverse opinion because of the departure from GAAP.  b) Express no assurance of any kind on the entity's financial statements.  c) Emphasize that the financial statements are for limited use only.  d) Disclose the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph of the accountant's report.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the nature of the engagement.  This is a standard review engagement,  which provides limited assurance on the financial statements.  The accountant has identified material misstatements due to the uncapitalized leases.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the options given.  Option a) is not applicable because an adverse opinion is typically issued in an audit engagement,  not a standard review.  Option b) is also not applicable because a standard review does provide some level of assurance,  just not as high as an audit.  Option c) is a possibility,  but it does not address the specific issue of the misstatements.
 Finally,  I need to consider the best course of action to address the misstatements while still providing limited assurance.  Option d) is the correct choice because it allows the accountant to disclose the specific issue of the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph of the report,  while still providing limited assurance on the overall financial statements.

What is Cobb's weighted average cost of goods sold for May?  Choices: a) $60.20  b) $62.10  c) $62.50  d) 65  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the total cost of goods available for sale.  The beginning inventory cost is $1250,  and the total cost of purchases is $116  + $440  = $556.
 The total cost of goods available for sale is $1250  + $556  = $1806.
 Next,  I need to calculate the total number of units available for sale.  The beginning inventory has 200  units,  and the total number of units purchased is 20  + 80  = 100  units.
 The total number of units available for sale is 200  + 100  = 300  units.
 Now,  I need to calculate the weighted average cost per unit.  The weighted average cost is the total cost of goods available for sale divided by the total number of units available for sale: $1806  ÷ 300  = $6.02  per unit.
 The weighted average cost of goods sold for the 10  units sold on May 14  is 10  * $6.02  = $60.20.

 Next,  I need to consider the payment date for this bill.  The bill is paid on June 1.
 Since the bill is due at the end of June 30,  but it is paid on June 1,  there is a delay of 30 days.
 Therefore,  Dash Co. should report the amount of the bill for the period from May 16  to June 15  as a liability in its June 30  balance sheet,  which is $6000.

"Input: A spouse died on December 31,  year 1.  The couple had no dependents.  What should be the filing status of the surviving spouse in year 2?  Choices: a) Single.  b) Married filing jointly.  c) Qualifying widow(er).  d) Head of household.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the rules for filing status after the death of a spouse.  The surviving spouse can choose to file as married filing jointly if they wish,  as long as they meet the requirements.
 Next,  I need to consider the qualifying widow(er) status.  This status is available for two years following the year of the spouse's death,  and requires that the surviving spouse was the main support of the spouse at the time of their death and did not remarry during the two-year period.
 In this case,  the spouse died on December 31,  year 1,  so the surviving spouse is eligible for the qualifying widow(er) status in year 2.

"Input: A company that produces a single product using a continuous process had no work in process on April 1.  During the month of April 10000  units were started and 9000  completed units were transferred.  The ending work-in-process inventory was complete as to materials and 50 % complete as to conversion.  The cost of direct materials was $114000  and the cost of direct labor amounted to $38000.  Manufacturing overhead is assigned at the rate of 50 % of direct materials.  For the purpose of determining the cost of goods manufactured in April what is the cost per equivalent whole unit?  Choices: a) $23.22  b) $21.40  c) $20.90  d) 15.4  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the total cost of direct materials.  The cost of direct materials is $114000.
 Next,  I need to calculate the total cost of direct labor.  The cost of direct labor is $38000.
 Now,  I need to calculate the manufacturing overhead.  The overhead is 50 % of direct materials,  so it is 0.5 * $114000 = $57000.
 The total cost of production is the sum of direct materials,  direct labor,  and overhead: $114000 + $38000 + $57000 = $199000.
 To find the cost per equivalent whole unit,  I need to divide the total cost by the total number of equivalent units.  The 9000  completed units are considered 100 % complete,  so they contribute 9000  equivalent units.  The 1000  ending work-in-process units are 50 % complete,  so they contribute 0.5 * 1000 = 500  equivalent units.  The total number of equivalent units is 9000 + 500 = 9500.
 The cost per equivalent whole unit is $199000 ÷ 9500 = $21.16.

 First,  I need to understand what a 5-for-1 stock split means.  A 5-for-1 stock split means that for every one share of stock an investor owns, they will receive five additional shares.
 Next,  I need to calculate the total number of shares after the split.  Prior to the split,  Alto Co.  had 10000  shares issued and outstanding.  After the split,  each of these shares is split into 5 shares,  so the total number of shares is 10000  * 5  = 50000  shares.
 Now,  I need to consider the effect on the par value of the stock.  The par value of the stock is the value assigned to each share of stock for accounting purposes.  In a stock split,  the total par value of the stock remains the same.
 To find the new par value,  I divide the total par value before the split by the total number of shares after the split.  The total par value before the split was 10000  shares * $10  per share = $100000.  The total number of shares after the split is 50000.  So the new par value is $100000  ÷ 50000  = $2  per share.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: In performing substantive tests regarding the granting of stock options to senior management of an issuer an auditor most likely would Choices: a) Confirm with those members of management as to whether they are actually option holders.  b) Verify the existence of option holders in the issuer's payroll and human resources records.  c) Trace the authorization for the options granted to the board of directors' approval.  d) Review the public records of the SEC to determine whether the options were properly reported.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the purpose of substantive tests in auditing.  Substantive tests are performed to gather evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
 Next,  I need to consider the specific context of stock options granted to senior management.  The focus is on verifying the accuracy and completeness of these transactions.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  Choice a) is about confirming with management members,  which may provide some evidence but is not the primary substantive test.
 Choice b) involves verifying the existence of option holders in payroll and HR records,  which is a relevant step in substantiating the transactions.
 Choice c) is about tracing the authorization to the board of directors' approval,  which is important for understanding the process but not the primary substantive test.
 Choice d) involves reviewing SEC public records,  which can provide evidence of proper reporting but is not the most direct substantive test for verifying the transactions.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: If the objective of an auditor's test of details is to detect the overstatement of sales the auditor should trace transactions from the Choices: a) Sales journal to the shipping documents.  b) Shipping documents to the cash receipts journal.  c) Cash receipts journal to the customer's purchase orders.  d) Customer's purchase orders to the sales journal.  
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the objective of the auditor's test of details.  The objective is to detect the overstatement of sales.
 Next,  we need to consider which choice provides the most direct and reliable evidence of sales.  Sales are initially recorded in the sales journal,  so tracing transactions from the sales journal to the shipping documents would provide direct evidence of the sales.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following methods should be used to account for research and development costs with no alternative future use?  Choices: a) Charging all costs to expense when incurred.  b) Capitalizing all costs when incurred.  c) Capitalizing costs specified by management and charging all other costs to expense.  d) Accumulating all costs in a separate component of stockholders' equity until the existence of future benefits can be determined.  
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the purpose of accounting for research and development (R&D) costs.  The main goal is to match costs with the revenues they generate and to avoid overestimating assets and net income.
 Next,  we need to consider the criteria for capitalizing or expensing R&D costs.  If the costs have no alternative future use,  it means they will not contribute to future revenues.  Therefore,  it is not reasonable to capitalize these costs.
 Finally,  we need to look at the choices provided.  Choice a) states that all costs should be charged to expense when incurred,  which aligns with the principle of matching costs with revenues and not overestimating assets.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Each of the following would be considered a Level 2  observable input that could be used to determine an asset or liability’s fair value,  except Choices: a) Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active b) Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in markets that are active c) Internally generated cash flow projections for a related asset or liability d) Interest rates that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a Level 2 observable input is.  A Level 2 observable input is a type of input used to determine an asset or liability's fair value that is less reliable than Level 1 inputs but more reliable than Level 3 inputs.
 Next,  I need to consider each choice and determine if it could be considered a Level 2 observable input.
 a) Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active: This is less reliable than Level 1 inputs because it is not active,  so it is not a Level 2 observable input.
 b) Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in markets that are active: This is a Level 2 observable input because it is more reliable than Level 3 inputs and less reliable than Level 1 inputs.
 c) Internally generated cash flow projections for a related asset or liability: This is not a Level 2 observable input because it is not based on observable market data.
 d) Interest rates that are observable at commonly quoted intervals: This is a Level 2 observable input because it is more reliable than Level 3 inputs and less reliable than Level 1 inputs.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following pricing policies results in establishment of a price to external customers higher than the competitive price for a given industry?  Choices: a) Collusive pricing b) Dual pricing c) Predatory pricing d) Transfer pricing 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand each pricing policy and its implications.  Collusive pricing involves cooperation among firms to set prices,  which can lead to higher prices for consumers.  Dual pricing is when a company charges different prices for the same product in different markets,  which can also result in higher prices for external customers.  Predatory pricing is when a company sets prices low enough to drive competitors out of the market,  with the intention of raising prices later.  Transfer pricing is the practice of charging one part of a multinational corporation different prices for goods or services sold between different divisions or subsidiaries.

Next,  I need to identify which pricing policy results in a price to external customers higher than the competitive price for a given industry.  Collusive pricing and dual pricing both involve cooperation or manipulation of prices to achieve higher prices for external customers.  Predatory pricing can lead to higher prices later, but it is not guaranteed to result in higher prices for external customers immediately.  Transfer pricing is not directly related to pricing for external customers.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: What term is used to represent unavoidable past costs that cannot be changed no matter what action is taken?  Choices: a) Prime costs b) Sunk costs c) Opportunity costs d) Incremental costs 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of the term being asked.  The question is asking for costs that are unavoidable and cannot be changed,  regardless of future actions.
 Next,  I will consider each choice and see if it fits the description.  a) Prime costs involve direct costs of production,  which can be changed.  b) Sunk costs represent costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered,  which fits the description.  c) Opportunity costs involve the value of the next best alternative,  which can be changed.  d) Incremental costs involve the change in cost when increasing production.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following is considered part of the required supplementary information for general purpose external financial reporting of a local government?  Choices: a) Fund financial statement.  b) Combining nonmajor fund statement.  c) Notes to the financial statements.  d) Management discussion and analysis.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the required supplementary information for general purpose external financial reporting of a local government.  According to the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB),  the required supplementary information includes certain financial statements and disclosures.
 Next,  I will examine each choice to see if it matches the required supplementary information.  Choice a) Fund financial statement is not a required supplementary information,  as it is a primary financial statement.  Choice b) Combining nonmajor fund statement is also not a required supplementary information,  as it is an optional statement.  Choice c) Notes to the financial statements is considered part of the required supplementary information,  as it provides additional details and explanations about the financial statements.  Choice d) Management discussion and analysis is not a required supplementary information,  as it is an internal document used by management for decision-making purposes.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The simple linear regression between stock and market returns Choices: a) fits the errors to obtain a more precise estimate of the stock’s beta.  b) minimises the stock’s alpha,  i. e.  its idiosyncratic component.  c) estimates the alpha of stock returns and their dependence on the market returns.  d) models market returns as a function of the stock returns and its beta.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the purpose of simple linear regression in the context of stock and market returns.  The goal is to model the relationship between the stock's returns and the market's returns.
 Next,  I will consider each choice and evaluate its relevance to this purpose.
 a) Fitting the errors to obtain a more precise estimate of the stock's beta is a part of the process of estimating the regression coefficients, but it does not directly describe the overall purpose of the regression.
 b) Minimising the stock's alpha, i.e., its idiosyncratic component, is another aspect of the regression process, focusing on reducing the unexplained variance in the stock's returns. However, this choice does not fully capture the purpose of the regression.
 c) Estimating the alpha of stock returns and their dependence on the market returns directly addresses the purpose of the regression. It aims to understand how much of the stock's returns can be explained by the market returns and how much is left as the stock's unique or idiosyncratic return.
 d) Modeling market returns as a function of the stock returns and its beta reverses the relationship, which is not the typical approach in simple linear regression for stock and market returns.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following financial instruments may be considered a derivative financial instrument?  Choices: a) Option contract.  b) Municipal bond.  c) Bank certificate of deposit.  d) Money market fund.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a derivative financial instrument is.  A derivative financial instrument is a financial contract whose value is derived from an underlying asset.  Examples include options, futures, and swaps.
 Next,  I will go through the choices and see which one fits the definition.  a) Option contract - an option contract is a financial contract whose value is derived from an underlying asset,  so it fits the definition.  b) Municipal bond - a municipal bond is a debt security issued by a government entity,  not derived from an underlying asset.  c) Bank certificate of deposit - a bank certificate of deposit is a deposit product that provides a fixed interest rate,  not derived from an underlying asset.  d) Money market fund - a money market fund invests in short-term debt securities,  but it is not a contract and does not derive its value from an underlying asset.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: When an accountant compiles projected financial statements,  the accountant’s report should include a separate paragraph that Choices: a) Disclaims any form of assurance on the historical financial statements.  b) Expresses limited assurance that the results will be within the projected range.  c) Describes the limitations on the usefulness of the projection.  d) Evaluates the hypothetical assumptions used to prepare the projection.  
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the purpose of a projected financial statement.  Projected financial statements are based on hypothetical assumptions and are used for planning and decision-making purposes.
 Next,  we need to consider the role of an accountant in preparing these statements.  The accountant is responsible for presenting the projections in a clear and understandable manner, while also being aware of the limitations and assumptions underlying the projections.
 Finally,  we need to evaluate the choices given.  Choice a) is incorrect because the accountant is not providing assurance on historical financial statements, but on the projections.  Choice b) is partially correct,  but it implies a level of assurance that may not be appropriate for projections.  Choice c) is the most appropriate answer,  as it acknowledges the limitations on the usefulness of the projection and is in line with the accountant's responsibility to be aware of and disclose these limitations.  Choice d) is relevant,  but it is not the primary focus of the accountant's report on projected financial statements.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Adam Smith is considering automating his pin factory with the purchase of a $475,000  machine.  Shipping and installation would cost $5,000.  Smith has calculated that automation would result in savings of $45,000  a year due to reduced scrap and $65,000  a year due to reduced labor costs.  The machine has a useful life of 4  years and falls in the 3 -year property class for MACRS depreciation purposes.  The estimated final salvage value of the machine is $120,000.  The firm's marginal tax rate is 34  percent.  The incremental cash outflow at time period 0  is closest to Choices: a) $280,000.00  b) $380,000.00  c) $480,000.00  d) $580,000.00  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the total initial cost of the machine,  including shipping and installation.  The initial cost is $475,000  + $5,000  = $480,000.
 Next,  I need to calculate the annual depreciation using the MACRS rates for a 4-year property class.  The rates are 33.33%,  44.45%,  14.81%,  7.41%.
 Now,  I need to calculate the incremental cash outflow at time period 0,  which includes the initial cost and the present value of the tax shield from depreciation.  To do this,  I'll calculate the tax shield for each year and then discount it to time period 0 using the after-tax savings from reduced labor costs.
 The after-tax savings from reduced labor costs are $65,000  * (1 - 0.34)  = $42,700  per year.
 The tax shield for each year is the depreciation amount multiplied by the tax rate (34%).  For year 1,  it is $480,000  * 0.3333  * 0.34  = $52,000.  For year 2,  it is $480,000  * 0.4445  * 0.34  = $70,000.  For year 3,  it is $480,0{'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: If requested to perform a compilation engagement for a nonissuer in which an accountant has an immaterial direct financial interest,  the accountant is Choices: a) Independent because the financial interest in the nonissuer is immaterial.  b) Not independent and,  therefore,  may not be associated with the financial statements.  c) Not independent and,  therefore,  may not issue a compilation report.  d) Not independent and,  therefore,  may issue a compilation report,  but may not issue a review report.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the definition of independence in accounting.  Independence means that the accountant's judgment is not influenced by a financial interest in the entity being audited.
 Next,  I need to consider the nature of the financial interest in this case.  The interest is described as ""immaterial,"" which means it is not significant enough to affect the accountant's judgment.
 Finally,  I need to consider the type of engagement being performed.  A compilation engagement is less rigorous than an audit and does not require the same level of independence.
 Based on these considerations,  the accountant can still perform a compilation engagement for a nonissuer with an immaterial direct financial interest.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Aston and Becker are equal partners in AB Partnership.  In the tax year the ordinary income of the partnership is $20000  and the partnership has a long-term capital gain of $12000.  Aston's basis in AB was $40000  and he received distributions of $5000  during the year.  What is Aston's share of AB's ordinary income?  Choices: a) $10,000  b) $15,000  c) $16,000  d) 18500  
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate Aston's share of the partnership's ordinary income. Since Aston and Becker are equal partners, they each receive half of the partnership's ordinary income. The ordinary income is $20,000, so Aston's share is 20,000 / 2 = $10,000.
 Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following procedures would an accountant least likely perform during an engagement to review the financial statements of a nonissuer?  Choices: a) Make inquiries of management about actions taken at board of directors' meetings.  b) Study the relationships of financial statement elements expected to conform to predictable patterns.  c) Identify internal control activities that are likely to prevent or detect material misstatements.  d) Compare the financial statements with anticipated results in budgets and forecasts.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the role of an accountant during a financial statement review engagement for a nonissuer.  The primary goal is to provide reasonable assurance about the absence of material misstatement in the financial statements.

Second,  I will consider each procedure and evaluate its relevance to this goal.  An accountant would likely make inquiries of management (a), study predictable patterns (b), and identify internal controls (c), as these are all methods to detect or prevent material misstatements.

Third,  I will compare the procedures to determine which one is least likely to be performed.  Comparing the financial statements with anticipated results in budgets and forecasts (d) is less directly related to the primary goal of detecting or preventing material misstatements.  While it can provide some insight, it is not as focused on the specific objective as the other procedures.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A compilation of financial statements in accordance with Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services is limited to presenting Choices: a) Accounting data that conforms with a special purpose framework other than GAAP.  b) Unaudited financial statements that omit substantially all required GAAP disclosures.  c) Information in the form of financial statements that is the representation of management.  d) Supplementary financial information that has been subjected to inquiry and analytical procedures.

 b) Unaudited financial statements that omit substantially all required GAAP disclosures.
 c) Information in the form of financial statements that is the representation of management.
 d) Supplementary financial information that has been subjected to inquiry and analytical procedures.

 Now,  I need to determine which choice is consistent with the SSARS.  The SSARS require that financial statements be presented in a manner that is faithful to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Stock A has a beta of 0.8,  while Stock B has a beta of 1.4.  The expected return on the market is 10 % and the risk-free rate is 7 %.  Using CAPM and this stock information,  what is the required rate of return for Stocks A and B,  respectively?  Choices: a) 9.4 % and 11.2 % b) −2.6 % and 4.9 % c) 4.3 % and 7.4 % d) 6.4 % and 10.5 % 
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate the required rate of return for Stock A using the CAPM formula: Required Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate). For Stock A, the required return is 7% + 0.8 * (10% - 7%) = 7% + 0.8 * 3% = 7% + 2.4% = 9.4%.
 Next, I need to calculate the required rate of return for Stock B using the same formula: Required Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate). For Stock B, the required return is 7% + 1.4 * (10% - 7%) = 7% + 1.4 * 3% = 7% + 4.2% = 11.2%.

 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the current assets.  Since the current ratio is 3-to-1,  current assets are 3 times current liabilities.  So,  current assets are 3 * $322000 = $966000.
 Next,  I need to calculate the inventory and prepaid expenses.  Since the quick ratio is 1-to-1,  current assets minus inventory and prepaid expenses are equal to current liabilities.  So,  $966000 - inventory and prepaid expenses = $322000.
 To find the inventory and prepaid expenses,  I subtract $322000 from $966000: $966000 - $322000 = $644000.

 2. Cost of testing the prototype: $40,000
 3. Legal costs to file a patent: $5,000

Now, I need to add up these costs to find the total R&D expenses:
$100,000 (prototype production) + $40,000 (prototype testing) + $5,000 (patent filing) = $145,000

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: While performing interim audit procedures of accounts receivable,  numerous unexpected errors are found resulting in a change of risk assessment.  Which of the following audit responses would be most appropriate?  Choices: a) Move detailed analytical procedures from year-end to interim.  b) Increase the dollar threshold of vouching customer invoices c) Send negative accounts receivable confirmations instead of positive accounts receivable confirmations d) Use more experienced audit team members to perform year-end testing 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the nature of the unexpected errors found during the interim audit procedures.  The errors indicate a higher risk of material misstatement in the accounts receivable.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the options provided and their relevance to addressing the increased risk.  Option a) suggests shifting analytical procedures to the interim,  which may not directly address the identified risks.
 Option b) proposes increasing the dollar threshold for vouching customer invoices,  which could potentially reduce the scope of the audit but may not adequately address the identified risks.
 Option c) suggests using negative confirmations instead of positive confirmations,  which can be more effective in identifying unrecorded accounts receivable and may help in addressing the increased risk.
 Option d) proposes using more experienced audit team members for year-end testing,  which may improve the quality of the testing but does not directly address the interim audit risks.

Therefore,  the most appropriate audit response in this situation is {'sol': 'c'}"

"Input: A company has income after tax of $5.4  million,  interest expense of $1  million for the year,  depreciation expense of $1  million,  and a 40 % tax rate.  What is the company’s times-interest-earned ratio?  Choices: a) 5.4  b) 6.4  c) 7.4  d) 10  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).  To do this,  I add the income after tax and the interest expense,  and then add back the depreciation expense: $5.4  + $1  + $1  = $7.4  million.
 Next,  I need to calculate the earnings before tax (EBT).  To do this,  I divide the EBIT by (1 - tax rate): $7.4  ÷ (1 - 0.4) = $12.33  million.
 Now,  I need to calculate the times-interest-earned ratio.  To do this,  I divide the EBIT by the interest expense: $7.4  ÷ $1  = 7.4.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The essence of responsibility accounting is Choices: a) Developing performance reports emphasizing costs and revenues that managers can control.  b) Allocating service department costs to production departments so that production department managers know all costs for which they are responsible.  c) Determining who is to blame for unfavorable variances.  d) Investigating all variances regardless of their status as favorable or unfavorable.  
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the essence of responsibility accounting.  Responsibility accounting is a system that assigns responsibility for costs and revenues to specific individuals or groups within an organization.
 Next,  we need to consider the choices given.  Choice a) focuses on developing performance reports that emphasize costs and revenues that managers can control, which aligns with the concept of assigning responsibility.
 Choice b) is about allocating service department costs to production departments, which is a part of cost allocation and not the essence of responsibility accounting.
 Choice c) is about determining blame for unfavorable variances, which is not the primary focus of responsibility accounting.

"Input: Mast Co.  converted from the FIFO method for inventory valuation to the LIFO method for financial statement and tax purposes.  During a period of inflation would Mast's ending inventory and income tax payable using LIFO be higher or lower than FIFO?  Ending inventory Income tax payable Choices: a) Lower Lower b) Higher Higher c) Lower Higher d) Higher Lower 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the difference between FIFO and LIFO methods.  FIFO assumes that the first items added to inventory are the first ones sold,  while LIFO assumes that the last items added to inventory are the first ones sold.
 In a period of inflation,  the prices of goods increase over time.  This means that the most recent inventory purchases (which are the last ones added under LIFO) are more expensive than the earlier purchases.
 When using LIFO,  the cost of goods sold (COGS) is higher because it includes the most recent,  and therefore more expensive,  inventory purchases.  This results in a lower net income for tax purposes.
 A lower net income means a lower income tax payable,  since taxes are calculated based on the net income.
 Therefore,  Mast's ending inventory and income tax payable using LIFO would be lower than FIFO in a period of inflation.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A company should recognize goodwill in its balance sheet at which of the following points?  Choices: a) Costs have been incurred in the development of goodwill.  b) Goodwill has been created in the purchase of a business.  c) The company expects a future benefit from the creation of goodwill.  d) The fair market value of the company’s assets exceeds the book value of the company’s assets.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand when a company should recognize goodwill.  Goodwill is an intangible asset that represents the value of a company's reputation, brand, customer relationships, and other factors that contribute to its earning potential. It is typically recognized in the context of an acquisition or merger when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.

Next,  I will evaluate each choice in relation to the recognition of goodwill.

a) Costs have been incurred in the development of goodwill: This choice refers to the ongoing development of goodwill, not its recognition. Goodwill is not recognized based on costs incurred in its development.

b) Goodwill has been created in the purchase of a business: This choice aligns with the criteria for recognizing goodwill. When a company acquires another business, goodwill is recognized if the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities.

c) The company expects a future benefit from the creation of goodwill: While this is a general principle for recognizing assets, it does not specifically address the recognition of goodwill in accounting. Goodwill is recognized based on the purchase price exceeding fair value, not solely on expectations of future benefits.

d) The fair market value of the company’s assets exceeds the book value of the company’s assets: This choice is related to the overall value of a company's assets but does not specifically address the recognition of goodwill. Goodwill is recognized in specific transactions, such as acquisitions, and is not recognized simply because the fair market value of assets exceeds their book value.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is the one that aligns with the criteria for recognizing goodwill in an acquisition or merger. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: An individual paid taxes 27  months ago,  but did not file a tax return for that year.  Now the individual wants to file a claim for refund of federal income taxes that were paid at that time.  The individual must file the claim for refund within which of the following time periods after those taxes were paid?  Choices: a) One year.  b) Two years.  c) Three years.  d) Four years.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the time period within which a tax refund claim can be filed after taxes were paid.  According to the IRS,  the individual must file the claim within a certain time period after the taxes were paid.
 Next,  I will consider each of the given choices:
 a) One year - This is not the correct time period,  as the IRS allows more time than one year.
 b) Two years - This is also not the correct time period,  as the IRS allows more time than two years.
 c) Three years - This is the correct time period,  as the IRS allows three years from the date the tax was paid to file a claim for refund.
 d) Four years - This is not applicable,  as the IRS does not allow four years.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following is an element of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures applicable to the firm's auditing practice?  Choices: a) Acceptance of a client relationship.  b) Professional skepticism of management.  c) Computer information processing.  d) Efficiency of organizational structures.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the elements of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures that are specifically applicable to the firm's auditing practice.  The choices are: a) Acceptance of a client relationship,  b) Professional skepticism of management,  c) Computer information processing,  and d) Efficiency of organizational structures.
 Next,  I need to determine which of these choices is directly related to the auditing practice.  Professional skepticism of management (b) is a key element of the auditing process,  as it involves questioning and critically evaluating the information provided by management.
 The other choices are not directly related to the auditing practice.  Acceptance of a client relationship (a) is more related to the firm's overall client management,  computer information processing (c) is a broader term that includes various technologies used in accounting,  and efficiency of organizational structures (d) is a general concern for any organization.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: In year 6,  an IRS agent completed an examination of a corporation’s year 5  tax return and proposed an adjustment that will result in an increase in taxable income for each of years 1  through year 5.  All returns were filed on the original due date.  The proposed adjustment relates to the disallowance of corporate jet usage for personal reasons.  The agent does not find the error to be fraudulent or substantial in nature.  Which of the following statements regarding this adjustment is correct?  Choices: a) The adjustment is improper because an agent may only propose adjustments to the year under examination.  b) The adjustment is proper because there is no statute of limitations for improperly claiming personal expenses as business expenses c) The adjustment is proper because it relates to a change in accounting method,  which can be made retroactively irrespective of the statute of limitations.  d) The adjustment is improper because the statute of limitations has expired for several years of the adjustment 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the IRS rules regarding the examination of tax returns.  An IRS agent can propose adjustments to the year under examination and any prior year returns that were not previously examined.  In this case,  the agent is proposing an adjustment to years 1  through 5,  which were all examined prior to the current year 6.
 Next,  I need to consider the nature of the adjustment.  The proposed adjustment relates to the disallowance of corporate jet usage for personal reasons,  which is not considered fraudulent or substantial in nature.  This means that the adjustment is proper.
 Finally,  I need to consider the statute of limitations for making adjustments to prior year tax returns.  The statute of limitations for making adjustments to prior year tax returns is generally three years from the date the return was filed or two years from the date the tax was paid,  whichever is later.  Since all returns were filed on the original due date,  the statute of limitations has not expired for any of the years in question.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Hall Co.  purchased a machine on January 1  at a cost of $140000.  The machine had an estimated useful life of eight years and a salvage value of $60000.  Hall chose to depreciate the machine using the double- declining balance method.  What was the carrying amount of the machine in Hall's balance sheet at the end of its second year of operations?  Choices: a) $60,000  b) $61,250  c) $78,750  d) 80000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the annual depreciation rate using the double-declining balance method.  The rate is calculated by taking the straight-line depreciation rate (1 ÷ 8) and multiplying it by 2,  resulting in 0.25 or 25%.
 Next,  I need to calculate the depreciation for the first year.  The depreciation for the first year is the cost of the machine ($140000) multiplied by the depreciation rate (0.25),  resulting in $35000.
 Now,  I need to calculate the carrying amount at the end of the first year.  The carrying amount is the cost of the machine ($140000) minus the depreciation for the first year ($35000),  resulting in $105000.
 For the second year,  I need to calculate the depreciation again.  The depreciation for the second year is the carrying amount at the end of the first year ($105000) multiplied by the depreciation rate (0.25),  resulting in $26250.
 Finally,  I need to calculate the carrying amount at the end of the second year.  The carrying amount is the carrying amount at the end of the first year ($105000) minus the depreciation for the second year ($26250),  resulting in $78750.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Large City does not use the modified approach to account for roads.  At the beginning of the current year the city spent $800000  on new roads.  The roads have a 20 -year useful life.  What amount should Large City report as an expense related to the new roads in the statement of activities for the current year?  Choices: a) $0  b) $20,000  c) $40,000  d) 800000  
 Output:
 First, I need to determine the annual depreciation expense for the new roads. Since the roads have a 20-year useful life, I will divide the initial cost by the useful life: $800,000 ÷ 20 years = $40,000 per year.
 Therefore, the amount that Large City should report as an expense related to the new roads in the statement of activities for the current year is $40,000.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Corbet Co.  purchased a copyright near the beginning of the current year from an author for $20000.  The legal life of the copyright is equivalent to the life of the author plus 50  years.  Corbet expects to sell the book for five years.  What amount should Corbet report as amortization expense related to the copyright at the end of the current year?  Choices: a) $0  b) $400  c) $500  d) 4000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the total legal life of the copyright.  The legal life is the author's life plus 50  years,  so the total legal life is 50  years.
 Next,  I need to determine the useful life of the copyright for Corbet Co.,  which is the expected selling period of the book,  5  years.
 Now,  I need to calculate the amortization rate.  To do this,  I divide the total cost of the copyright ($20000) by the useful life (5  years).  So,  the amortization rate is $20000 ÷ 5  = $4000  per year.
 Since the copyright was purchased near the beginning of the year,  the amortization expense for the entire year is $4000.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The sole shareholder of an S corporation contributed equipment with a fair market value of $20,000  and a basis of $6,000  subject to $12,000  liability.  What amount is the gain,  if any,  that the shareholder must recognize Choices: a) $0  b) $6,000  c) $8,000  d) $12,000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the adjusted basis of the equipment contributed by the shareholder.  The adjusted basis is the original basis minus the liability assumed by the corporation: $6,000  - $12,000  = -$6,000.
 Next,  I need to compare the fair market value of the equipment ($20,000) to the adjusted basis (-$6,000).  Since the fair market value is greater than the adjusted basis,  there is a recognized gain.
 To calculate the recognized gain,  I subtract the adjusted basis from the fair market value: $20,000  - (-$6,000) = $26,000.
 However,  the recognized gain is limited to the amount of the increase in basis,  which is the difference between the fair market value and the original basis: $20,000  - $6,000  = $14,000.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Carter Co.  had the following items on its balance sheet at the end of the current year: Cash and cash equivalents $ 200000  Short-term investments 100000  Accounts receivable 400000  Inventories 600000  Patent‚Äì10  years 300000  Equipment 1000000  Accumulated depreciation 200000  The amount of current liabilities at the end of the current year was $640000.  What is Carter's working capital at the end of the current year?  Choices: a) $60,000  b) $560,000  c) $660,000  d) 960000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the current assets.  Current assets include Cash and cash equivalents,  Short-term investments,  Accounts receivable,  and Inventories.  So,  the total current assets are 200000  + 100000  + 400000  + 600000  = 1300000  dollars.
 Next,  I need to calculate the working capital.  Working capital is the difference between current assets and current liabilities.  So,  the working capital is 1300000  - 640000  = 660000  dollars.
 Therefore,  Carter's working capital at the end of the current year is 660000  dollars,  which corresponds to option c) $660,000.

The answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: If a CPA recklessly departs from the standards of due care when conducting an audit the CPA will be liable to third parties who are unknown to the CPA under the law of Choices: a) Strict liability.  b) Breach of contract.  c) Negligence.  d) Gross negligence.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the question.  The question is about the legal consequences of a CPA (Certified Public Accountant) not following the standards of due care during an audit.
 Next,  I need to consider the possible legal theories that could apply in this situation.  The options given are strict liability,  breach of contract,  negligence,  and gross negligence.
 Strict liability generally applies when the law imposes liability without requiring proof of negligence or fault.  This does not seem to fit the context of the question,  as the question implies that the CPA's actions were a result of not following the standards of due care,  which implies a lack of negligence or fault.
 Breach of contract would require a valid contract between the CPA and the third party.  The question does not mention such a contract,  so this option is unlikely.
 Negligence and gross negligence both involve a failure to exercise the level of care that a reasonably prudent person would under similar circumstances.  In the context of an audit,  this would mean failing to follow the standards of due care.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Given a 10 % discount rate with cash inflows of $3,000  at the end of each year for five years and an initial investment of $11,000,  what is the net present value?  Choices: a) -$9,500  b) $370  c) $4,000  d) $11,370  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the present value of the cash inflows.  Since the cash inflows are an annuity,  I can use the formula for the present value of an annuity: PV = P * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r], where P is the payment, r is the discount rate, and n is the number of periods.
 In this case,  P = $3,000, r = 0.10 (10 %), and n = 5.
 Plugging in the values,  I get PV = $3,000 * [(1 - (1 + 0.10)^-5) / 0.10] = $3,000 * [(1 - (1.10)^-5) / 0.10] = $3,000 * [(1 - 0.620921323) / 0.10] = $3,000 * [0.379078677 / 0.10] = $3,000 * 3.79078677 = $11,372.36.
 Next,  I need to calculate the net present value.  The net present value is the present value of the cash inflows minus the initial investment: NPV = $11,372.36 - $11,000 = $372.36.
 The closest answer to this value is $370,  so the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following factors most likely would heighten an auditor's concern about the risk of fraudulent financial reporting?  Choices: a) The audit committee's approval of the initial selection of accounting principles.  b) A lack of competition in the entity's industry accompanied by increasing profit margins.  c) Management's disclosure of unresolved litigation and contingent liabilities.  d) Year-end adjustments by the entity that significantly affect financial results.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider which factor would increase the risk of fraudulent financial reporting.  Fraudulent financial reporting is when a company intentionally misrepresents its financial information to deceive stakeholders.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice in the context of increasing the risk of fraud.  a) The audit committee's approval of the initial selection of accounting principles is a standard procedure and does not inherently increase the risk of fraud.
 b) A lack of competition in the entity's industry accompanied by increasing profit margins could indicate that the company is using aggressive accounting practices to inflate its profits, which could be a sign of increased risk of fraud.
 c) Management's disclosure of unresolved litigation and contingent liabilities is a transparent disclosure and does not inherently increase the risk of fraud.
 d) Year-end adjustments by the entity that significantly affect financial results could be a result of legitimate accounting practices, but they could also be used to manipulate financial results, which could be a sign of increased risk of fraud.

After evaluating each choice,  the factor that most likely would heighten an auditor's concern about the risk of fraudulent financial reporting is b) A lack of competition in the entity's industry accompanied by increasing profit margins.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following techniques effectively measures improvements in product quality as a result of internal failure costs?  Choices: a) Inspection of in-process goods.  b) Recording the number of products returned over time.  c) Tracking the number of products reworked.  d) Tracking warranty expenses over time.  
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the concept of internal failure costs.  These costs are incurred when products are found to be defective before they are shipped to customers.  The goal is to measure the effectiveness of quality improvement efforts in reducing these costs.

Next,  we can analyze each choice:
a) Inspection of in-process goods - This can help identify defects early, but it does not directly measure the reduction in internal failure costs.
b) Recording the number of products returned over time - This measures customer dissatisfaction, not internal failure costs.
c) Tracking the number of products reworked - This can indicate the number of defects found after the product has been shipped, not internal failure costs.
d) Tracking warranty expenses over time - This measures the cost of fixing defects after the product has been shipped, which is related to external failure costs, not internal failure costs.

Therefore,  none of the given choices directly measure improvements in product quality as a result of internal failure costs.  However, the closest option is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A CPA prepares a client’s tax return containing business travel expenses without inquiring about the existence of documentation for the expenses.  Which statement best describes the consequence of the CPA’s lack of inquiry?  Choices: a) The CPA may be assessed a tax return preparer penalty.  b) The CPA may be charged with preparing a fraudulent return c) The client will not owe an understatement penalty if the return is audited and the expenses disallowed d) The client will not be subject to a fraud penalty 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the CPA's responsibility to ensure the accuracy of the tax return.  The CPA must exercise due care and diligence in preparing the return,  which includes verifying the existence of documentation for the business travel expenses.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the potential consequences of the CPA's lack of inquiry.  If the CPA does not verify the documentation,  there is a risk that the return may contain inaccurate information,  potentially leading to an understatement of the client's tax liability.
 Now,  I need to compare the potential consequences to the given choices.  Choice a) suggests that the CPA may be assessed a tax return preparer penalty,  which could be a consequence of negligence or a lack of due care.  Choice b) suggests that the CPA may be charged with preparing a fraudulent return,  which is a more severe consequence but could apply if the CPA knowingly prepares an inaccurate return.  Choice c) suggests that the client may not owe an understatement penalty if the return is audited and the expenses are disallowed,  which is a possible outcome if the CPA's lack of inquiry led to an inaccurate return.  Choice d) suggests that the client will not be subject to a fraud penalty,  which is not directly related to the CPA's actions.
 Therefore,  the best statement that describes the consequence of the CPA's lack of inquiry is {'sol': 'a'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the nature of the equipment and its intended use.  The equipment is used in research and development activities with alternative future uses.
 Next,  I need to consider the accounting principles for research and development costs.  According to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP),  if an asset has alternative future uses,  it should be capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful life.
 Therefore,  the proper treatment of the cost of equipment used in research and development activities that will have alternative future uses is to capitalize and depreciate it over its estimated useful life.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 First,  I need to calculate the total liabilities of King and Simmon before eliminating the intercompany liabilities.  King's total liabilities are $450,000,  and Simmon's total liabilities are $200,000.
 Next,  I need to eliminate the intercompany liability,  which is the $100,000  note payable to King.
 The adjusted total liabilities for King and Simmon are $450,000  + $200,000  - $100,000  = $550,000.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Confirmation of accounts receivable that have been categorized initially by an auditor as ‚Äúexceptions‚Äù most likely could be due to Choices: a) Customers who have credit or zero balances with the client.  b) Responses that were mailed rather than faxed to the auditor.  c) Accounts receivable that have been classified as uncollectible.  d) Payments mailed to the client that have not been recorded.  
 Output:
 First, let's consider the nature of ""exceptions"" in the context of accounts receivable confirmation. Exceptions typically refer to discrepancies or issues that need further investigation.

Next, let's analyze each choice:

a) Customers who have credit or zero balances with the client. This choice suggests that the auditor might have mistakenly included customers with no outstanding balance as having an exception. This is a possible reason for categorizing an account as an exception.

b) Responses that were mailed rather than faxed to the auditor. This choice is less likely to be the reason for categorizing an account as an exception, as the method of communication (mail vs. fax) should not inherently create a discrepancy or issue that requires further investigation.

c) Accounts receivable that have been classified as uncollectible. This choice is also less likely to be the reason for categorizing an account as an exception, as uncollectible accounts are a standard accounting practice and do not typically create a discrepancy that requires further investigation.

d) Payments mailed to the client that have not been recorded. This choice suggests that there is a discrepancy between the actual payments received and the recorded balances, which would indeed create an exception that requires further investigation.

Based on the analysis, the most likely reason for categorizing accounts receivable as ""exceptions"" is due to payments that have been mailed to the client but have not been recorded. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Accrual accounting involves accruals and deferrals.  Which of the following best describes accruals and deferrals?  Choices: a) Accruals are concerned with expected future cash receipts and payments while deferrals are concerned with past cash receipts and payments.  b) Accruals are concerned with past cash receipts and payments while deferrals are concerned with expected future cash receipts and payments.  c) Both accruals and deferrals are concerned with expected future cash receipts and payments.  d) Both accruals and deferrals are concerned with past cash receipts and payments.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the difference between accruals and deferrals.  Accruals are transactions that have occurred but no cash has been exchanged,  while deferrals are transactions that have occurred but the cash has not yet been exchanged.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  Choice a) states that accruals are concerned with expected future cash receipts and payments while deferrals are concerned with past cash receipts and payments.  This is incorrect because accruals are not concerned with expected future cash receipts and payments,  but rather with transactions that have occurred without cash exchange.
 Choice b) states that accruals are concerned with past cash receipts and payments while deferrals are concerned with expected future cash receipts and payments.  This is also incorrect because accruals are not concerned with past cash receipts and payments,  but rather with transactions that have occurred without cash exchange.
 Choice c) states that both accruals and deferrals are concerned with expected future cash receipts and payments.  This is incorrect because accruals are concerned with transactions that have occurred without cash exchange,  not with expected future cash receipts and payments.
 Choice d) states that both accruals and deferrals are concerned with past cash receipts and payments.  This is the correct answer because accruals are concerned with transactions that have occurred without cash exchange,  and deferrals are concerned with transactions that have occurred but the cash has not yet been exchanged.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: An accountant has been engaged to compile a nonissuer's financial statements that contain several misapplications of accounting principles and unreasonable accounting estimates.  Management is unwilling to revise the financial statements and the accountant believes that modification of the standard compilation report is not adequate to communicate the deficiencies.  Under these circumstances the accountant should Choices: a) Disclaim an opinion on the financial statements and advise the board of directors that the financial statements should not be relied upon.  b) Inform management that the engagement can proceed only if distribution of the accountant's compilation report is restricted to internal use.  c) Determine the effects of the deficiencies and add a separate paragraph to the compilation report that describes the deficiencies and their effects.  d) Withdraw from the compilation engagement and provide no further services concerning these financial statements.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the nature of the issues identified in the financial statements.  In this case,  there are misapplications of accounting principles and unreasonable accounting estimates,  which are significant issues that cannot be adequately addressed through a standard compilation report.
 Next,  I need to consider the unwillingness of management to revise the financial statements.  Since management is not willing to address the identified issues,  it is not possible to provide an unmodified standard compilation report.
 Finally,  I need to consider the accountant's belief that modification of the standard compilation report is not adequate to communicate the deficiencies.  This indicates that the accountant recognizes the seriousness of the issues and believes that a different approach is needed.
 Based on these considerations,  the appropriate action for the accountant is to withdraw from the compilation engagement and provide no further services concerning these financial statements.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following cannot be amortized for tax purposes?  Choices: a) Incorporation costs.  b) Temporary directors’ fees.  c) Stock issuance costs.  d) Organizational meeting costs.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the definition of amortization for tax purposes.  Amortization allows the taxpayer to spread out the cost of an asset over a period of time,  reducing the taxable income each year.
 Next,  I need to examine each choice and determine if it fits the definition of an asset that can be amortized.  Incorporation costs,  stock issuance costs,  and organizational meeting costs are all considered expenses related to starting a business and can be amortized over 18 months.
 Temporary directors’ fees,  on the other hand,  are not considered an asset that can be amortized.  They are considered ordinary business expenses and must be deducted in the year they are incurred.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: What is the process by which products and services of a business entity are measured and evaluated relative to the best possible levels of performance?  Choices: a) Measuring the performance gap b) Standard measurement c) Benchmarking d) Variance management 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the question.  The question is asking about the process that measures and evaluates products and services of a business entity relative to the best possible levels of performance.
 Next,  I can eliminate options that do not fit the description.  a) Measuring the performance gap is about identifying the difference between actual and desired performance, not measuring and evaluating relative to the best possible levels.  b) Standard measurement is about comparing actual results to a standard, but it does not necessarily evaluate relative to the best possible levels of performance.  d) Variance management is about managing differences between actual and planned results, but it does not specifically measure and evaluate products and services relative to the best possible levels.
 This leaves c) Benchmarking,  which is the process of measuring and evaluating products and services against the best in the industry.  Benchmarking involves comparing actual performance to the best possible levels of performance.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The expected selling price for a new product is $19.00.  Management's goal is to obtain a 20 % contribution margin on all sales.  If the new product has variable selling and distribution costs of $3.00  per unit what is the product's target variable manufacturing cost?  Choices: a) $12.20  b) $12.80  c) $15.80  d) 18.2  
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate the contribution margin per unit. The contribution margin is the selling price minus the variable costs, and in this case, we want a 20% contribution margin on the selling price. So, the contribution margin per unit is $19.00 * 0.20 = $3.80.
 Next, I need to determine the total variable costs per unit. The variable selling and distribution costs are $3.00 per unit.
 To find the target variable manufacturing cost, I subtract the variable selling and distribution costs from the contribution margin per unit: $3.80 - $3.00 = $0.80.
 Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Mill Co.  reported pretax income of $152500  for the year ended December 31.  During the year-end audit the external auditors discovered the following errors: Ending inventory $30000  overstated Depreciation expense $64000  understated What amount should Mill report as the correct pretax income for the year ended December 31?  Choices: a) $58,500  b) $118,500  c) $186,500  d) 246500  
 Output:
 First, I need to adjust the pretax income for the errors found during the year-end audit. The ending inventory is overstated by $30,000, which means the reported income is higher than it should be. To correct this, I need to subtract the overstated amount from the pretax income: $152,500 - $30,000 = $122,500.
 Next, I need to adjust the pretax income for the understated depreciation expense. The depreciation expense is understated by $64,000, which means the reported income is lower than it should be. To correct this, I need to add the understated amount to the adjusted pretax income: $122,500 + $64,000 = $186,500.
 Therefore, the correct pretax income for the year ended December 31 is $186,500.
 Output: {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following defenses is likely to be successful in a suit alleging negligence by a CPA?  Choices: a) Due care.  b) Ignorance of the law.  c) Lack of intent.  d) Lack of mental capacity.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the defense that can be used to argue against a negligence claim.  Negligence is a legal concept that refers to the failure to exercise the level of care that a reasonable person would in similar circumstances.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice in the context of a CPA (Certified Public Accountant) being sued for negligence.  A CPA is expected to have a higher standard of care due to their profession.
 a) Due care: This defense can be used to argue that the CPA exercised the appropriate level of care in their professional capacity, which would be a successful defense against a negligence claim.
 b) Ignorance of the law: This defense is generally not successful because a CPA is expected to be aware of the law governing their profession.
 c) Lack of intent: This defense is not relevant to a negligence claim, as negligence is about the failure to exercise due care, not about intent.
 d) Lack of mental capacity: This defense is not likely to be successful, as a CPA is expected to have the mental capacity to practice their profession.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: On May 1  of the prior year,  Baker purchased equipment with a five-year useful life for a cost of $10,000.  Baker adopted the MACRS depreciation system and did not utilize any special depreciation deductions.  On March 1  of the current year,  Baker sold the equipment.  The MACRS depreciation schedule for five-year property is listed below:
 First year - 20.00 %
 Second year - 32.00 %
 Third year - 19.20 %
 What amount of depreciation can Baker deduct in the current year?  Choices: a) $533  b) $1,600  c) $2,000  d) $3,200  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the depreciation for the prior year (the second year).  According to the MACRS schedule,  the depreciation rate for the second year is 32.00 %.
 So,  the depreciation for the second year is 32.00 % of $10,000,  which is 0.32 * $10,000 = $3,200.
 Next,  I need to determine the depreciation for the current year.  Since the equipment was purchased on May 1  of the prior year,  it has been in use for 8 months of the current year.
 The depreciation rate for the third year is 19.20 %,  so the depreciation for the current year is 8/12 of 19.20 % of $10,000.
 This is (8/12) * 0.192 * $10,000 = $1,280.
 Therefore,  Baker can deduct $1,280 in the current year.
 The question asks for the amount of depreciation that Baker can deduct in the current year, but the provided choices do not include $1,280.  However,  the closest option to $1,280 is a) $533.
 So,  the answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: An entity engaged an accountant to review its financial statements in accordance with Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services.  The accountant determined that the entity maintained its accounts on a comprehensive basis of accounting other than generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  In this situation,  the accountant most likely would have taken which of the following actions?  Choices: a) Withdrawn from the engagement because the entity has not been following GAAP.  b) Advised management to make the adjustments necessary for the account balances to conform with GAAP.  c) Modified the review report to reflect the fact that the financial statements were presented on another comprehensive basis of accounting.  d) Requested that management justify the use of the other comprehensive basis of accounting in the management representation letter.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the situation.  The entity maintains its accounts on a comprehensive basis of accounting other than GAAP.  This means that the financial statements are not prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  The accountant has an obligation to review the financial statements in accordance with Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services,  which requires adherence to GAAP.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the choices based on the obligation to adhere to GAAP.  Choice a) suggests that the accountant would withdraw from the engagement,  which could be a valid action if the entity's basis of accounting is not acceptable.  Choice b) suggests that the accountant would advise management to make adjustments,  which is not in line with the accountant's obligation to adhere to GAAP.  Choice c) suggests that the accountant would modify the review report,  which could be an appropriate action if the financial statements are presented on another comprehensive basis of accounting.  Choice d) suggests that the accountant would request justification for the use of the other comprehensive basis of accounting,  which is a relevant action to ensure compliance with the engagement's standards.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The city of Cobb has two trust funds for the benefit of the city's library trust fund A and trust fund B.  Only the earnings from trust fund A can be expended and both the principal and interest from trust fund B can be expended.  How should the city of Cobb report each trust fund?  Trust fund A Trust fund B Choices: a) Permanent Permanent b) Permanent Special revenue c) Special revenue Permanent d) Special revenue Special revenue 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the nature of each trust fund.  Trust fund A can only have its earnings expended,  meaning it is a special revenue fund because it can only be used for specific purposes.
 Next,  trust fund B can use both its principal and interest for expenditures,  which means it is a permanent fund because it can be used for ongoing operations and services.
 Therefore,  the city of Cobb should report trust fund A as Special revenue and trust fund B as Permanent.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A firm's inventory turnover (IT) is 5  times on a cost of goods sold (COGS) of $800,000.  If the IT is improved to 8  times while the COGS remains the same,  a substantial amount of funds is released from or additionally invested in inventory.  In fact,  Choices: a) $160,000  is released.  b) $100,000  is additionally invested.  c) $60,000  is additionally invested.  d) $60,000  is released.  
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate the average inventory for the initial inventory turnover of 5 times. The formula for inventory turnover is IT = COGS / Average Inventory. Rearranging the formula to solve for Average Inventory, we get Average Inventory = COGS / IT. For the initial situation, the average inventory is $800,000 / 5 = $160,000.

Next, I need to calculate the average inventory for the improved inventory turnover of 8 times. Using the same formula, the average inventory is now $800,000 / 8 = $100,000.

To find the difference in inventory, I subtract the new average inventory from the old average inventory: $160,000 - $100,000 = $60,000.

Since the average inventory has decreased, this means that $60,000 is released from inventory. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following statements would most likely appear in an auditor's engagement letter?  Choices: a) Management is responsible for reporting to us any inadequate provisions for the safeguarding of assets.  b) We will identify internal controls relevant to specific assertions that may prevent or detect material misstatements.  c) Management agrees to correct all deficiencies in internal control activities identified by us.  d) Management is responsible for making all financial records and related information available to us.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the role of the auditor in the engagement letter.  The auditor's role is to provide an opinion on the fairness of the financial statements,  based on their assessment of the internal controls and the financial records.
 Next,  I need to consider which statement reflects the auditor's responsibilities and expectations.  Statement a) is a responsibility of management,  not the auditor.  Statement c) is a commitment from management,  not an expectation or responsibility of the auditor.  Statement d) is a responsibility of management,  not the auditor.
 Statement b) reflects the auditor's responsibility to identify internal controls relevant to specific assertions that may prevent or detect material misstatements.  This is a key part of the auditor's role in conducting an effective audit.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following factors most likely would cause a CPA not to accept a new audit engagement?  Choices: a) Management reputation for failing to provide schedules to prior auditors on a timely basis.  b) The CPA's inability to review the predecessor auditor's working papers.  c) Management's unwillingness to make all financial records available to the CPA.  d) The CPA's lack of understanding of the entity's operations and industry.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the factors that could lead to a CPA not accepting a new audit engagement.  One important factor is the willingness of the management to cooperate with the auditor.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  Choice a) Management reputation for failing to provide schedules to prior auditors on a timely basis.  This indicates that the management may not cooperate in the future.
 Choice b) The CPA's inability to review the predecessor auditor's working papers.  This is a concern,  but it is not as direct a reason for not accepting the engagement as the management's unwillingness to cooperate.
 Choice c) Management's unwillingness to make all financial records available to the CPA.  This directly relates to the management's cooperation and willingness to be audited.
 Choice d) The CPA's lack of understanding of the entity's operations and industry.  This is a concern,  but it is more of a technical issue that can be addressed with research or consultation.

After evaluating the choices,  the factor that most likely would cause a CPA not to accept a new audit engagement is the management's unwillingness to make all financial records available to the CPA.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following pairs of elements must a client prove to hold an accountant liable for common law fraud?  Choices: a) Material misrepresentation and breach of contract.  b) Freedom from contributory negligence and loss.  c) Scienter and justifiable reliance.  d) Intent to deceive and privity.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the elements that must be proven for an accountant to be held liable for common law fraud.  The elements are intent to deceive and privity.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A corporate taxpayer plans to switch from the FIFO method to the LIFO method of valuing inventory.  Which of the following statements is accurate regarding the use of the LIFO method?  Choices: a) In periods of rising prices,  the LIFO method results in a lower cost of sales and higher taxable income,  when compared to the FIFO method.  b) The taxpayer is required to receive permission each year from the Internal Revenue Service to continue the use of the LIFO method.  c) The LIFO method can be used for tax purposes even if the FIFO method is used for financial statement purposes.  d) Under the LIFO method,  the inventory on hand at the end of the year is treated as being composed of the earliest acquired goods.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the difference between the FIFO and LIFO methods of valuing inventory.  FIFO stands for First-In,  First-Out,  meaning that the oldest goods are sold first,  resulting in the newest goods remaining in inventory.  LIFO stands for Last-In,  First-Out,  meaning that the newest goods are sold first,  resulting in the oldest goods remaining in inventory.
 Next,  I need to consider the impact of these methods on cost of sales and taxable income in periods of rising prices.  Since the LIFO method results in the newest goods being sold first,  the cost of sales will be higher because the newest goods are typically more expensive due to inflation.  This means that the LIFO method will result in a higher taxable income compared to the FIFO method,  since the cost of sales is subtracted from revenue to calculate taxable income.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Lemon owned 2000  shares of Spectrol Corp.  common stock that were purchased in year 1  at $10.50  per share.  In year 4  Lemon received a 5 % non-taxable dividend of Spectrol common stock.  In year 5  the stock split 2 -for-1.  In the current year Lemon sold 800  shares.  What is Lemon's basis in the 800  shares of stock sold?  Choices: a) $4,000  b) $8,000  c) $8,400  d) 16800  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the total cost of the initial 2000  shares.  The cost per share was $10.50,  so the total cost is 2000  * $10.50  = $21,000.
 Next,  I need to consider the 5 % non-taxable dividend in year 4.  This means Lemon received 5 % of the 2000  shares,  which is 0.05 * 2000  = 100  shares.  Since the dividend is non-taxable,  it does not affect the basis.
 Then,  I need to consider the 2-for-1 stock split in year 5.  This means Lemon's 2000  shares became 4000  shares.  However,  the basis remains the same,  so the basis per share is now $21,000 ÷ 4000  = $5.25  per share.
 Finally,  I need to calculate Lemon's basis in the 800  shares sold.  The basis per share is $5.25,  so the total basis is 800  * $5.25  = $4,200.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Increasing the credit period from 30  to 60  days,  in response to a similar action taken by all of our competitors,  would likely result in: Choices: a) an increase in the average collection period.  b) a decrease in bad debt losses.  c) an increase in sales.  d) higher profits.  
 Output:
 First,  consider the impact of increasing the credit period from 30  to 60  days.  This means that customers will have an additional 30  days to pay their invoices.
 Next,  assume that the action is taken by all competitors,  so the market standard credit period is now 60  days.
 Now,  consider the possible outcomes based on the choices given:
 a) An increase in the average collection period: This is likely,  as customers will now have more time to pay their invoices.
 b) A decrease in bad debt losses: This is less certain,  as it depends on customer behavior and the likelihood of customers paying within the extended period.
 c) An increase in sales: This is possible,  as customers may be more inclined to make purchases with a longer payment period.
 d) Higher profits: This is also possible,  but it depends on the balance between the increased sales and the potential increase in bad debt losses,  as well as other factors like costs and pricing.

Based on the analysis,  the most direct and likely outcome is an increase in the average collection period.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following characteristics most likely would heighten an auditor's concern about the risk of material misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting?  Choices: a) The entity's industry is experiencing declining customer demand.  b) Employees who handle cash receipts are not bonded.  c) Bank reconciliations usually include in-transit deposits.  d) Equipment is often sold at a loss before being fully depreciated.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider which choice indicates a potential for fraudulent financial reporting.  This means looking for situations where there is an opportunity for someone to manipulate financial records or engage in deceit.
 Next,  I analyze each choice:
 a) The entity's industry is experiencing declining customer demand.  While this could be a concern,  it does not directly indicate a risk of fraudulent financial reporting.
 b) Employees who handle cash receipts are not bonded.  This is a concern because unbonded employees have access to cash and could potentially embezzle funds without detection.
 c) Bank reconciliations usually include in-transit deposits.  This is a normal practice to account for deposits that have not yet been processed by the bank,  and does not indicate a risk of fraudulent financial reporting.
 d) Equipment is often sold at a loss before being fully depreciated.  While this could be a concern,  it does not directly indicate a risk of fraudulent financial reporting.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: An auditor is selecting prenumbered purchase orders for testing an entity's internal control activities related to their proper approval before office equipment is ordered.  The auditor is matching random numbers with the purchase order numbers to determine which purchase orders to inspect.  If a random number matches a voided purchase order the auditor ordinarily would replace the voided purchase order with another if the voided purchase order Choices: a) Represents office equipment ordered and never received.  b) Has been properly voided in the normal course of business.  c) Represents office equipment ordered and canceled before being processed by the vendor.  d) Has been electronically deleted from the purchase order file.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the purpose of selecting prenumbered purchase orders for testing internal control activities.  The auditor is doing this to ensure that all purchase orders are properly approved before office equipment is ordered.
 Next,  I need to consider the scenario where a random number matches a voided purchase order.  A voided purchase order is one that has been canceled or invalidated for some reason.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the choices given:
 a) Represents office equipment ordered and never received.  This could indicate a potential issue with the internal control activities related to approving purchase orders.
 b) Has been properly voided in the normal course of business.  This is a valid reason for a purchase order to be voided and does not indicate a problem with the internal control activities.
 c) Represents office equipment ordered and canceled before being processed by the vendor.  This is also a valid reason for a purchase order to be voided and does not indicate a problem with the internal control activities.
 d) Has been electronically deleted from the purchase order file.  This indicates that the purchase order has been removed from the system and does not exist anymore, so it does not need to be inspected.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: An auditor of a nonissuer should design tests of details to ensure that sufficient audit evidence supports which of the following?  Choices: a) The planned level of control risk.  b) Management’s assertions that internal controls exist and are operating efficiently.  c) The effectiveness of internal controls.  d) The planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level.  
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the purpose of the tests of details for an auditor of a nonissuer.  The primary goal is to ensure that the audit evidence gathered supports the audit's objectives.
 Next,  we need to consider the options provided and their relevance to the auditor's objectives.  Option a) refers to the planned level of control risk, which is not the primary focus of tests of details for a nonissuer.  Option b) relates to management's assertions about internal controls, which is relevant but not the main objective.  Option c) discusses the effectiveness of internal controls, which is also relevant but not the primary purpose of tests of details.  Option d) focuses on the planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level, which directly relates to the auditor's objective of ensuring that sufficient audit evidence supports the audit's conclusions.

"Input: Mill CPA was engaged by a group of royalty recipients to apply agreed-upon procedures to financial data supplied by Modern Co.  regarding Modern's written assertion about its compliance with contractual requirements to pay royalties.  Mill's report on these agreed-upon procedures should contain a(an) Choices: a) Disclaimer of opinion about the fair presentation of Modern's financial statements.  b) List of the procedures performed (or reference thereto) and Mill's findings.  c) Opinion about the effectiveness of Modern's internal control activities concerning royalty payments.  d) Acknowledgment that the sufficiency of the procedures is solely Mill's responsibility.  
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the nature of the engagement.  Mill CPA is performing agreed-upon procedures,  not an audit or review.  This means they are following specific procedures agreed upon by all parties and reporting their findings,  without expressing an opinion on the financial statements or the effectiveness of internal controls.
 Next,  we can eliminate choices that are not applicable to an agreed-upon procedures engagement.  Choice a) is related to an audit or review,  so it can be eliminated.  Choice c) is also related to an audit or review,  as it involves an opinion on internal controls,  so it can be eliminated.
 This leaves us with choices b) and d).  Choice b) is relevant to an agreed-upon procedures engagement,  as it would include a list of the procedures performed and Mill's findings.  Choice d) is not relevant,  as the responsibility for the sufficiency of the procedures is shared between Mill and the client.

 First,  I need to consider the definition of the equity method.  The equity method is used to account for investments in which the investor has significant influence over the investee company.  In this case,  Goll Co.  has a 25 % interest in Rose Co.  and an 18 % interest in Jave Co.  
Next,  I need to determine if Goll has significant influence over either company.  Since neither investment gives Goll the ability to exercise significant influence over either company's operating and financial policies,  Goll does not have significant influence over either Rose or Jave.
Therefore,  Goll should not use the equity method to account for either investment.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: What is the present value of $10  received in two years’ time if the discount rate is 9 %?  Choices: a) $9  b) $11  c) $8.26  d) $8.42  
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate the present value using the formula: PV = FV / (1 + r)^n, where PV is the present value, FV is the future value ($10 in this case), r is the discount rate (9% or 0.09), and n is the number of periods (2 years).
 PV = 10 / (1 + 0.09)^2
 PV = 10 / (1.09)^2
 PV = 10 / 1.1881
 PV ≈ 8.42
 Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following circumstances generally will cause a discharge of contractual duties by operation of law?  Choices: a) Novation.  b) Accord and satisfaction.  c) Anticipatory repudiation.  d) Impossibility of performance.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the circumstances that can lead to a discharge of contractual duties by operation of law.  These circumstances are:
 1) Novation: A new contract is formed between different parties, and the original parties are discharged.
 2) Accord and satisfaction: The parties agree to settle the claim outside of the contract.
 3) Anticipatory repudiation: One party indicates that they will not perform their contractual obligations in the future.
 4) Impossibility of performance: It is impossible for one or both parties to perform their contractual obligations due to unforeseen circumstances.

 Now,  I need to determine which of the choices generally will cause a discharge of contractual duties by operation of law.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: In searching for unrecorded liabilities an auditor most likely would examine the Choices: a) Cutoff bank statement for deposits recorded in the books but not by the bank.  b) Details of accounts receivable confirmations that are classified as ""exceptions"".  c) Files of purchase requisitions for items ordered just before the year end.  d) Receiving reports for items received before year end but not yet recorded.  
 Output:
 First, let's consider what unrecorded liabilities are. Unrecorded liabilities are obligations that have been incurred but not yet recorded in the financial statements.
 Next, let's consider the options given. Option a involves examining a cutoff bank statement, which may reveal deposits that have been recorded in the books but not yet by the bank. This could potentially be an unrecorded liability if the company has paid a liability but the bank has not yet processed the payment.
 Option b involves examining details of accounts receivable confirmations that are classified as ""exceptions"". While this may reveal issues with recorded accounts receivable, it does not directly address unrecorded liabilities.
 Option c involves examining purchase requisitions for items ordered just before the year end. This may reveal issues with timing of expenses, but it does not directly address unrecorded liabilities.
 Option d involves examining receiving reports for items received before year end but not yet recorded. This directly addresses unrecorded liabilities, as it could reveal obligations for items received but not yet recorded in the financial statements.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The capital structure of Merritt Co.  is 20 % common equity and debt equal to 80 %.  The cost of common equity is 10 % and the pretax cost of debt is 5 %.  Merritt's tax rate is 21 %.  What is Merritt's weighted-average cost of capital?  Choices: a) 5.16 % b) 6.00 % c) 6.98 % d) 7.50 % 
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate the after-tax cost of debt. The pretax cost of debt is 5%, and the tax rate is 21%, so the after-tax cost of debt is 5% * (1 - 0.21) = 5% * 0.79 = 3.95%.
 Next, I need to calculate the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC is calculated as the weighted sum of the cost of equity and the after-tax cost of debt, based on their respective proportions in the capital structure. The cost of common equity is 10%, and the proportion of common equity is 20%, so the contribution of equity to WACC is 10% * 0.20 = 2%. The cost of debt is 3.95%, and the proportion of debt is 80%, so the contribution of debt to WACC is 3.95% * 0.80 = 3.16%.
 The total WACC is the sum of the contributions from equity and debt: 2% + 3.16% = 5.16%.
 Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Greene is the sole shareholder of Seagull,  a calendar-year S corporation.  Greene's basis at the beginning of the year is $15,000.  Seagull reported an ordinary loss of $5,000  and $2,000  of municipal bond interest for the year.  Seagull distributed cash of $6,000  to Greene on November 1.  What is Greene's basis in Seagull at the end of the year?  Choices: a) $4,000  b) $6,000  c) $14,000  d) $15,000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the net income Greene can deduct from the ordinary loss and municipal bond interest.  The ordinary loss of $5,000  cannot be deducted because it is a loss,  but the $2,000  of municipal bond interest is tax-free and can be deducted.
 Next,  I need to adjust Greene's basis by subtracting the deductible income and adding the cash distribution received.  Greene's basis is $15,000  - $2,000  + $6,000  = $19,000.
 However,  Greene's basis in Seagull at the end of the year cannot exceed the original basis.  So,  I need to compare the adjusted basis of $19,000  with the original basis of $15,000.
 The lower value is the correct answer,  which is $15,000.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Holt Co.  discovered that in the prior year it failed to report $40000  of depreciation related to a newly constructed building.  The depreciation was computed correctly for tax purposes.  The tax rate for the current year was 20 %.  How should Holt report the correction of error in the current year?  Choices: a) As an increase in accumulated depreciation of $32000.  b) As an increase in accumulated depreciation of $40000.  c) As an increase in depreciation expense of $32000.  d) As an increase of depreciation expense of $40000.  
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the nature of the error.  Holt Co.  failed to report $40000  of depreciation in the prior year.  This means that the depreciation expense was understated by $40000.
 Next,  we need to consider the tax implications of this error.  Since the depreciation was computed correctly for tax purposes, the taxable income was correctly reduced by the amount of the depreciation.  Therefore,  there is no additional tax effect to consider.
 Now,  we need to determine how to correct the error in the current year.  Since the depreciation expense was understated in the prior year, we need to increase the depreciation expense in the current year to correct the error.  The amount of the increase should be $40000.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following factors most likely would cause an accountant not to accept an engagement to compile the financial statements of a nonissuer?  Choices: a) A lack of segregation of duties in the entity's accounting and payroll departments.  b) Indications that reports of asset misappropriation are not investigated by management.  c) The entity's intention to omit from the financial statements substantially all of the disclosures required by GAAP.  d) Management's acknowledgement that the financial statements will be included in a written personal financial plan.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the nature of the engagement.  Compiling financial statements means that the accountant is not providing an opinion on the fairness of the financial statements,  but rather providing assurance that the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 Next,  I need to consider the factors that would cause an accountant to decline an engagement.  An accountant would likely decline if there is a significant risk that the financial statements are not prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the choices.  a) A lack of segregation of duties in the entity's accounting and payroll departments could indicate a risk of fraud or errors in the financial statements.  b) Indications that reports of asset misappropriation are not investigated by management could also indicate a risk of fraud.  c) The entity's intention to omit from the financial statements substantially all of the disclosures required by GAAP is a clear violation of GAAP and would likely cause an accountant to decline the engagement.  d) Management's acknowledgement that the financial statements will be included in a written personal financial plan is not a significant risk to the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP.

"Input: Which of the following transactions correctly illustrates the doctrine of substantial performance?  Choices: a) Blair ordered a dozen blue chairs from Kyle but Kyle delivered a dozen red chairs.  b) Leslie painted an entire room but failed to put the electrical outlet covers back on.  c) A contract required hair styling to be done to Toby's satisfaction but Toby was in good faith dissatisfied with the completed result.  d) A dentist competently completed the extraction of Lee's tooth but mistakenly pulled the wrong one.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the doctrine of substantial performance.  Substantial performance means that the party who made a promise has fulfilled the essential terms of the contract to a significant degree,  even if there are some minor breaches.
 Now,  I will analyze each choice to see which one correctly illustrates this doctrine.
 a) Blair ordered blue chairs but received red chairs.  This is a minor breach,  but it does not fulfill the essential terms of the contract.
 b) Leslie painted a room but forgot to put outlet covers back on.  This is a minor breach,  but it does not fulfill the essential terms of the.{'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: In assessing the tolerable rate of deviations of a test of controls that was performed using statistical sampling an auditor should consider that Choices: a) Deviations from pertinent controls do not affect the risk of material misstatement in the accounting records.  b) Deviations from pertinent controls at a given rate ordinarily result in misstatements at a lower rate.  c) When the degree of assurance desired in a sample is high the auditor should allow for a high level of sampling risk.  d) Increasing the number of items selected for the test of controls usually increases the tolerable rate of deviations.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the question.  The question is about assessing the tolerable rate of deviations in a test of controls using statistical sampling.
 Next,  I need to analyze each choice and determine which one is correct.
 a) Deviations from pertinent controls do not affect the risk of material misstatement in the accounting records.  This choice is incorrect because deviations from pertinent controls actually increase the risk of material misstatement.
 b) Deviations from pertinent controls at a given rate ordinarily result in misstatements at a lower rate.  This choice is incorrect because it contradicts the fact that deviations from pertinent controls increase the risk of material misstatement.
 c) When the degree of assurance desired in a sample is high, the auditor should allow for a high level of sampling risk.  This choice is incorrect because allowing for a high level of sampling risk means that the auditor is willing to accept a higher risk of not detecting misstatements, which is not desirable when assessing the tolerable rate of deviations.
 d) Increasing the number of items selected for the test of controls usually increases the tolerable rate of deviations.  This choice is correct because when more items are selected for testing, the auditor can be more confident in the overall control environment, allowing for a higher tolerable rate of deviations.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The covariance between Stock A and the market index is 88,  while their standard deviations are respectively 19 % and 14 %.  What is the beta of Stock A?  Choices: a) 0.24  b) 0.35  c) 0.245  d) 0.45  
 Output:
 First,  I need to recall the formula for beta,  which is the covariance between the stock and the market index divided by the variance of the market index.  The variance of the market index is the square of its standard deviation,  so 14  % squared is 196  % squared.
 Next,  I plug in the values into the formula: beta = covariance / variance = 88 / 196 = 0.45.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Summer,  a single individual,  had a net operating loss of $20,000  three years ago.  A Code Sec.  1244  stock loss made up three-fourths of that loss.  Summer had no taxable income from that year until the current year.  In the current year,  Summer has gross income of $80,000  and sustains another loss of $50,000  on Code Sec.  1244  stock.  Assuming that Summer can carry the entire $20,000  net operating loss to the current year,  what is the amount and character of the Code Sec.  1244  loss that Summer can deduct for the current year?  Choices: a) $35,000  ordinary loss.  b) $35,000  capital loss.  c) $50,000  ordinary loss.  d) $50,000  capital loss.  
 Output:
 First,  we need to determine the amount of the Code Sec.  1244  stock loss from three years ago.  Since three-fourths of the $20,000  net operating loss was from Code Sec.  1244  stock, the loss is 20,000  * 3/4 = $15,000.
 Next,  we consider the new loss from the current year,  which is $50,000.
 Now,  we add the old Code Sec.  1244  stock loss to the new loss: 15,000  + 50,000  = $65,000.
 According to Code Sec.  1244,  the maximum amount that can be treated as an ordinary loss is $50,000.  Any amount in excess of $50,000 is treated as a capital loss.
 Therefore,  the Code Sec.  1244  loss that Summer can deduct for the current year is $50,000  ordinary loss.

"Input: Prior to the issuance of its December 31  financial statements Stark Co.  was named as a defendant in a lawsuit arising from an event that occurred in October.  Stark's legal counsel believes that it is reasonably possible that there will be an unfavorable outcome and that damages will range from $100000  to $150000.  Which amount(s) should Stark accrue and/or disclose in its December 31  financial statements?  Accrue contingent liability Disclose contingent liability Choices: a) $100000  $100000  - $150000  b) $100000  $150000  c) $0  $100000  - $150000  d) $0  $150000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine if Stark Co.  has a contingent liability.  A contingent liability exists when there is a potential future loss that is probable and can be reasonably estimated.  In this case,  Stark Co.  was named as a defendant in a lawsuit that arose from an event in October,  and there is a reasonable possibility of an unfavorable outcome with damages ranging from $100000  to $150000.  This meets the criteria for a probable and reasonably estimable loss.

Next,  I need to decide whether Stark Co.  should accrue or disclose the contingent liability.  An accrual is when a company recognizes a liability and expense in the same period as the related revenue.  A disclosure is when a company notes the contingent liability in the notes to the financial statements but does not recognize it as an expense or liability.  In this case,  the damages are reasonably estimable,  so Stark Co.  should accrue the liability.

Finally,  I need to determine the amount to accrue.  The amount to accrue is the lower of the two possible damages,  as per accounting principles.  Therefore,  Stark Co.  should accrue $100000  and disclose the range of $100000  to $150000.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

Choices: a) $75,000  b) $300,000  c) $375,000  d) 475000  
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate the total amount of revenues received by the capital projects fund. This includes the transfer from the general fund, the federal capital grant, and the special assessment for capital improvements. 

For the transfer from the general fund, the amount is $100,000.
For the federal capital grant, the amount is $75,000.
For the special assessment for capital improvements, the amount is $300,000.

To find the total amount of revenues, I add these amounts together: $100,000 + $75,000 + $300,000 = $475,000.

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the situation where the client has a valid reason for not confirming a selected account receivable.  This could be due to confidentiality concerns,  legal restrictions,  or other reasons.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the options available to the auditor.  Option a) involves using alternative procedures to verify the account balance,  which could include inspecting bank statements and cash receipt records.  Option b) involves selecting a different account for confirmation that is approximately the same size.  Option c) involves requesting the client's management to document the matter in the management representation letter.  Option d) involves explaining to the client that the request may lead to a disclaimer of opinion.

In December Dari learned that it is probable it will be required to pay between $150000  and $200000  within the next six months in satisfaction of its guarantee but no amount within that range is more likely.  What amount of contingent liability should Dari accrue in its December 31  balance sheet?  Choices: a) $200,000  b) $175,000  c) $150,000  d) 0  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the amount of contingent liability that Dari should accrue based on the probable loss.  The information states that it is probable Dari will have to pay between $150,000  and $200,000  in the next six months.
 Next,  I need to consider the range of possible losses and identify the amount that is most likely.  In this case,  no amount within the range of $150,000  to $200,000  is more likely than the others.
 To account for this,  I will take the midpoint of the range as the amount of contingent liability to accrue.  The midpoint is ($150,000  + $200,000) ÷ 2  = $175,000.
 Therefore,  Dari should accrue a contingent liability of $175,000  in its December 31  balance sheet.

Markson needs to know the answer to which of the following questions in order to determine whether the exchange has commercial substance?  Choices: a) Does the book value of the asset given up exceed the fair value of the asset received?  b) Is the gain on the exchange less than the increase in future cash flows?  c) Are the future cash flows expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange?  d) Is the exchange nontaxable?  
 Output:
 First,  Markson needs to determine if the exchange has commercial substance,  which means the future cash flows are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange.  To do this,  Markson needs to compare the book value of the asset given up to the fair value of the asset received.  In this case,  the book value of the concrete-mixing truck is $10,000,  and the fair value of the cement-mixing machine is $11,000.
 The question Markson needs to answer is whether the book value of the asset given up exceeds the fair value of the asset received.  Since the fair value of the cement-mixing machine ($11,000) is greater than the book value of the concrete-mixing truck ($10,000),  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: An analyst expects a company to pay a dividend of $5  with a dividend growth rate of 3 %.  The inflation rate is expected to fall from 5 % per year to 3 % per year.  As a result of the change in the inflation premium,  the company's Choices: a) Stock price will likely decrease.  b) Cost of equity will likely remain stable.  c) Cost of equity will likely decrease.  d) Stock price will likely remain stable.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the impact of the change in the inflation rate on the required rate of return.  The required rate of return is typically calculated using the dividend discount model, which includes the dividend growth rate and the required rate of return due to inflation.

Next,  I need to analyze the effect of the decrease in the inflation rate on the required rate of return.  A decrease in the inflation rate means that investors require a lower return to compensate for inflation.

Finally,  I need to consider how the change in the required rate of return affects the stock price.  According to the dividend discount model, the stock price is the present value of future dividends, discounted at the required rate of return.  A decrease in the required rate of return will likely lead to an increase in the stock price.

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand that the standard deviation of a portfolio is calculated using the formula: 

 sqrt((w1^2 * s1^2) + (w2^2 * s2^2) + 2 * w1 * w2 * s1 * s2 * r)

 where w1 and w2 are the weights of the stocks, s1 and s2 are the standard deviations of the stocks, and r is the correlation between the stocks.

 In this case,  since an equal weighted portfolio is formed,  the weights are both 0.5 (50%).

 Plugging the values into the formula: 

 sqrt((0.5^2 * 6%^2) + (0.5^2 * 18%^2) + 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 6% * 18% * 0.2)

 Simplifying: 

 sqrt((0.25 * 0.06^2) + (0.25 * 0.18^2) + 2 * 0.25 * 0.06 * 0.18 * 0.2)

 Calculating: 

 sqrt((0.25 * 0.0036) + (0.25 * 0.0324) + 2 * 0.25 * 0.00108)

 Continuing the calculation: 

 sqrt(0.0009 + 0.0081 + 0.00054)

The remeasurement of Mentor's financial statements resulted in a $25000  gain at year end.  The translation of the financial statements resulted in a $40000  gain at year end.  What amount should Mentor recognize as foreign currency gain in its income statement?  Choices: a) $0  b) $25,000  c) $40,000  d) 65000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand that the remeasurement gain is already in the functional currency (Swiss franc),  so it does not need to be translated.
 Next,  I need to consider that the translation gain is in a different currency (Swiss franc),  so it needs to be converted to the reporting currency (U. S.  dollar).
 To find the total foreign currency gain,  I add the remeasurement gain and the translation gain in the reporting currency: $25,000  + $40,000  = $65,000.

Choices: a) $5.06  b) $6.11  c) $7.20  d) $9.60  
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate the cost of producing and shipping the product in U.S. dollars. The product costs 116.50 pesos to produce and ship, and 0.1099 U.S. dollars are required to buy one Mexican peso. So, the cost in U.S. dollars is 116.50 * 0.1099 = 12.77 U.S. dollars.
 Next, I need to calculate the selling price of the product in U.S. dollars. The product sells for 20 euros in Europe, and 0.8928 U.S. dollars are required to buy one euro. So, the selling price in U.S. dollars is 20 * 0.8928 = 17.86 U.S. dollars.
 To find the profit on the sale, I subtract the cost from the selling price: 17.86 - 12.77 = 5.09 U.S. dollars.

"Input: Dodd Co. 's debt securities at December 31  included available-for-sale securities with a cost basis of $24000  and a fair value of $30000.  Dodd's income tax rate was 20 %.  What amount of unrealized gain or loss should Dodd recognize in its income statement at December 31?  Choices: a) $6000  loss.  b) $0  c) $4800  gain.  d) $6000  gain.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the unrealized gain or loss.  The fair value of the securities is $30000,  and the cost basis is $24000,  so the unrealized gain is $30000 - $24000 = $6000.
 Next,  I need to consider the income tax rate.  Since the securities are classified as available-for-sale,  Dodd can recognize a portion of the unrealized gain in its income statement.  The income tax rate is 20 %,  so the recognized gain is $6000 * 0.20 = $1200.
 Therefore,  Dodd should recognize a $1200 gain in its income statement at December 31.

 First,  let's consider the nature of equity and bonds.  Equity represents ownership in a company,  while bonds represent debt.
 Next,  let's examine the choices one by one.  Choice a) states that both equity and bonds can be issued by firms,  which is true.  Choice d) states that both equity and bonds can be traded on the secondary market,  which is also true.
 Now,  let's consider choice b) and choice c).  Choice b) states that equity payouts (dividends) are made after corporation tax has already been deducted,  while choice c) states that bond payouts (coupons) are made before corporation tax has been deducted.  This is the correct distinction between equity and bonds.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Suppose that the market price of Company X is $45  per share and that of Company Y is $30.  If X offers three-fourths a share of common stock for each share of Y,  the ratio of exchange of market prices would be: Choices: a) 0.667  b) 1  c) 1.125  d) 1.5  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the number of shares of X that are equivalent to one share of Y.  Since X offers three-fourths a share of common stock for each share of Y,  the ratio is 3/4.
 Next,  I need to find the ratio of the market prices.  Since the market price of X is $45 per share and the market price of Y is $30 per share,  the ratio of the market prices is 45 ÷ 30 = 1.5.
 Now,  I need to combine the two ratios to find the ratio of exchange of market prices.  Since the ratio of the number of shares is 3/4 and the ratio of the market prices is 1.5,  the ratio of exchange of market prices is (3/4) * 1.5 = 1.125.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following activities is not an element of a CPA firm's quality control system to be considered in establishing quality control policies and procedures?  Choices: a) Deciding whether to accept or continue a client relationship.  b) Selecting personnel for advancement who have the necessary qualifications.  c) Assessing a client's ability to establish effective internal controls.  d) Monitoring the effectiveness of professional development activities.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the quality control system of a CPA firm.  The quality control system is designed to ensure that the services provided by the firm are of a high quality and are performed in accordance with professional standards.
 Next,  I need to consider the elements of the quality control system.  These elements include selecting personnel, assessing client relationships, and monitoring professional development activities.
 Now,  I need to evaluate each choice to determine which one is not an element of the quality control system.  Choice a) Deciding whether to accept or continue a client relationship is an element of the quality control system, as it is important to ensure that the firm is only accepting or continuing relationships with clients that are appropriate.
 Choice b) Selecting personnel for advancement who have the necessary qualifications is also an element of the quality control system, as it is important to ensure that the firm is hiring and promoting qualified personnel.
 Choice c) Assessing a client's ability to establish effective internal controls is not an element of the quality control system, as the focus of the quality control system is on the firm's own processes and not on the client's internal controls.
 Choice d) Monitoring the effectiveness of professional development activities is an element of the quality control system, as it is important to ensure that the firm's personnel are continuously improving their skills and knowledge.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Strom acquired a 25 % interest in Ace Partnership by contributing land having an adjusted basis of $16,000  and a fair market value of $50,000.  The land was subject to a $24,000  mortgage,  which was assumed by Ace.  No other liabilities existed at the time of the contribution.  What was Strom's basis in Ace?  Choices: a) $0  b) $16,000  c) $26,000  d) $32,000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the adjusted basis of the land contributed by Strom.  The adjusted basis is given as $16,000.
 Next,  I need to consider the mortgage assumed by Ace.  The mortgage amount is $24,000.
 To find Strom's basis in Ace,  I add the adjusted basis of the land to the mortgage assumed by Ace: $16,000  + $24,000  = $40,000.
 However,  Strom only acquired a 25 % interest in Ace Partnership.  To find his share of the basis,  I divide the total basis by 4 (since 100 % is divided into 4 equal parts of 25 % each): $40,000  ÷ 4  = $10,000.
 Therefore,  Strom's basis in Ace is $10,000,  which is not among the given choices.  There might be an error in the choices provided.

"Input: Subsequent to issuing a report on audited financial statements,  a CPA discovers that the accounts receivable confirmation process omitted a number of accounts that are material,  in the aggregate.  Which of the following actions should the CPA take immediately?  Choices: a) Bring the matter to the attention of the board of directors or audit committee.  b) Withdraw the auditor’s report from those persons currently relying on it.  c) Perform alternative procedures to verify account balances.  d) Discuss the potential financial statement adjustments with client management.  
 Output:
 First,  the CPA should identify the nature and extent of the omitted accounts.  This is important to understand the impact of the omission on the financial statements.
 Next,  the CPA should determine the appropriate course of action based on the severity of the omission.  If the omission is material,  the CPA should consider the options provided.
 The correct action to take immediately is to bring the matter to the attention of the board of directors or audit committee (option a).  This is because the board and audit committee are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A company sells DVD players for $200  per unit.  The players have a unit variable cost of $160.  The company estimates that it will sell one home entertainment system for every four DVD players sold.  Home entertainment systems have a unit variable cost of $460  and sell for $600  per unit.  The company's fixed costs are $90000.  Assuming that the sales mix estimate is correct how many DVD players need to be sold for the company to break even?  Choices: a) 300  b) 500  c) 1200  d) 1500  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the contribution margin for each product.  For DVD players,  the contribution margin is the selling price minus the variable cost: $200  - $160  = $40.
 For home entertainment systems,  the contribution margin is the selling price minus the variable cost: $600  - $460  = $140.
 Next,  I need to calculate the sales mix ratio.  The company sells one home entertainment system for every four DVD players sold,  so the sales mix ratio is 4:1.
 Now,  I need to calculate the weighted average contribution margin.  To do this,  I multiply the contribution margin of each product by its sales mix ratio and then add them together: ($40  * 4) + ($140  * 1) = $160  + $140  = $300.
 To find the break-even point in units,  I divide the fixed costs by the weighted average contribution margin: $90000  ÷ $300  = 300.
 Therefore,  the company needs to sell 300 DVD players to break even.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Felton Farm Supplies,  Inc.,  has an 8  percent return on total assets of $300,000  and a net profit margin of 5  percent.  What are its sales?  Choices: a) $3,750,000.00  b) $480,000  c) $300,000  d) $1,500,000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the net income.  The return on total assets is 8  percent of $300,000,  so the net income is 0.08 * $300,000 = $24,000.
 Next,  I need to use the net profit margin to find the sales.  The net profit margin is 5  percent,  so the sales can be calculated as the net income divided by the net profit margin: $24,000 ÷ 0.05 = $480,000.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: An entity prepares its financial statements on its income tax basis.  The accompanying notes include a summary of significant accounting policies that discusses the basis of presentation and describes how that basis differs from GAAP.  The dollar amount of the effects of the difference between the income tax basis and GAAP Choices: a) Is required to be included only in the auditor's report.  b) Is required to be included only in the notes to the financial statements.  c) Is required to be included both in the notes to the financial statements and the auditor's report.  d) Need not be quantified and included in either the notes to the financial statements or the auditor's report.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the difference between the income tax basis and GAAP.  The income tax basis is the basis used for income tax purposes,  while GAAP is the generally accepted accounting principles used for financial reporting purposes.
 Next,  I need to consider the requirement for quantifying the effects of the difference between the income tax basis and GAAP.  According to accounting standards,  the effects of the difference should be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
 Finally,  I need to consider the auditor's report.  The auditor's report is a statement by the auditor that expresses an opinion on whether the financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects.  The auditor's report does not require the quantification of the effects of the difference between the income tax basis and GAAP.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: An auditor decides to use the blank form of positive accounts receivable confirmation.  The auditor should be aware that the blank form may be ineffective because Choices: a) All accounts do not have an equal opportunity to be selected for confirmation.  b) Accounts unconfirmed may have already been written off as uncollectible.  c) Few responses may occur because more effort is required of recipients.  d) Accounts actually confirmed may not be representative of the population.  
 Output:
 First, let's consider the purpose of the blank form of positive accounts receivable confirmation. It is a method where the auditor sends a confirmation request to the client's customers, asking them to verify their outstanding balances.

Now, let's analyze each choice:
a) All accounts do not have an equal opportunity to be selected for confirmation. This is a valid concern because if the auditor selects a sample of accounts based on certain criteria (e.g., size, age), some accounts may be more likely to be selected than others, leading to potential bias in the sample.

b) Accounts unconfirmed may have already been written off as uncollectible. This is also a valid concern because if the unconfirmed accounts have been written off, the auditor may not be able to verify their balances, which could lead to an inaccurate assessment of the accounts receivable balance.

c) Few responses may occur because more effort is required of recipients. This is a valid concern because the blank form requires the recipient to fill it out and return it, which may discourage some customers from responding, especially if they are not accustomed to receiving such requests.

d) Accounts actually confirmed may not be representative of the population. This is a valid concern because, even if the auditor selects a random sample of accounts to send the confirmation request to, the actual responses received may not be representative of the entire population of accounts receivable due to various reasons, such as selective non-response.

Therefore, the auditor should be aware that the blank form may be ineffective because of multiple reasons, including the ones listed in choices a), b), c), and d). The correct answer is {'sol': 'a, b, c, d'}"
"Input: Gamma Co.  a manufacturer of medical products had a 10 % return on assets and an asset turnover of 4 :1.  What was Gamma's profit margin on sales?  Choices: a) 40.00 % b) 10.00 % c) 4.00 % d) 0.025  
 Output:
 First, I need to understand the given information. Return on assets (ROA) is calculated as net income divided by total assets, and asset turnover is calculated as sales divided by total assets.

Given:
1. ROA = 10%
2. Asset turnover = 4:1

We can express ROA and asset turnover in terms of equations:
1. ROA = Net Income / Total Assets = 10%
2. Asset Turnover = Sales / Total Assets = 4

To find the profit margin, we need to express it in terms of the given information. Profit margin is calculated as net income divided by sales.

Profit Margin = Net Income / Sales

We can rearrange the ROA equation to solve for Net Income:
Net Income = ROA * Total Assets

We can rearrange the asset turnover equation to solve for Sales:
Sales = Asset Turnover * Total Assets

Now, we can substitute these expressions into the profit margin equation:
Profit Margin = (ROA * Total Assets) / (Asset Turnover * Total Assets)

Since Total Assets is in both the numerator and denominator, it cancels out:
Profit Margin = ROA / Asset Turnover

Now we can plug in the given values:
Profit Margin = 10% / 4

Profit Margin = 2.5%

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A company whose stock is trading at $10  per share has 1,000  shares of $1  par common stock outstanding when the board of directors declares a 30 % common stock dividend.  Which of the following adjustments should be made when recording the stock dividend?  Choices: a) Treasury stock is debited for $300.  b) Additional paid-in capital is credited for $2,700.  c) Retained earnings is debited for $300.  d) Common stock is debited for $3,000.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the number of shares issued as part of the stock dividend.  A 30 % stock dividend means that 30 % of the 1,000  shares will be issued as a dividend,  so the number of shares issued is 1,000  * 0.30 = 300  shares.
 Next,  I need to determine the value of the stock dividend.  The stock is trading at $10  per share,  so the value of the stock dividend is 300  * $10  = $3,000.
 Now,  I need to determine the adjustment to retained earnings.  When a stock dividend is declared,  the retained earnings are debited for the value of the stock dividend,  which is $3,000.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: An auditor is evaluating a client’s internal controls.  Which of the following situations would be the most difficult internal control issue for an auditor to detect?  Choices: a) The accounting staff neglects the control,  due to increased transactions to be processed.  b) The technology department writes a program that does not properly implement the control,  due to a lack of understanding.  c) Two employees,  who work in different departments,  are circumventing an internal control.  d) Someone erroneously disables edit checks in a software program designed to identify control exceptions.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider which situation would be the most difficult for an auditor to detect.  An auditor's job is to identify and assess the effectiveness of internal controls.  They would need to observe,  test,  and evaluate the controls to determine if they are functioning as intended.
 In situation a),  the accounting staff neglecting the control could be detected by the auditor through observation and testing.  The auditor could look for signs of reduced attention to detail or increased errors in processing transactions.
 In situation b),  the technology department's lack of understanding could also be detected by the auditor.  The auditor could review the program code and documentation to assess the implementation of the control.
 In situation c),  two employees circumventing an internal control would likely be detected by the auditor through testing and observation.  The auditor could look for unusual patterns in transactions or discrepancies between the recorded data and physical evidence.
 In situation d),  someone disabling edit checks in a software program could be detected by the auditor through testing and observation.  The auditor could run the software with the edit checks enabled to identify any control exceptions.

Considering these options,  situation c) is the most difficult internal control issue for an auditor to detect.  This is because it involves collusion between two employees from different departments,  which could make it harder for the auditor to identify the circumvention without specific evidence or a tip.
Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: If a five-year bond has a yield of 6 % and a ten-year bond has a yield of 5 %,  what is the yield curve likely to be?  Choices: a) upward sloping b) 3 % at −5  c) 4 % at −10  d) downward sloping 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the relationship between bond yields and their maturities.  In general,  longer maturities are associated with higher yields.  However,  in this case,  the yield decreases as the maturity increases.
 The five-year bond has a yield of 6 % and the ten-year bond has a yield of 5 %.  This indicates that as the maturity increases,  the yield decreases.
 Therefore,  the yield curve is likely to be downward sloping.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following,  discovered during an audit,  most likely would raise a question concerning possible illegal acts?  Choices: a) Related party transactions,  although properly disclosed,  were pervasive during the year.  b) The entity prepared several large checks payable to cash during the year.  c) Material internal control weaknesses previously reported to management were not corrected.  d) The entity was a campaign contributor to several local political candidates during the year.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider which of the choices could indicate a potential issue with illegal acts.  A pervasive pattern of related party transactions,  even if properly disclosed,  could raise questions about potential conflicts of interest or misuse of funds.
 Next,  preparing large checks payable to cash without proper documentation or oversight could indicate potential misuse of funds or lack of proper internal controls.
 Material internal control weaknesses that were not corrected could indicate a lack of proper oversight or a willingness to ignore control deficiencies.
 Finally,  contributing to political candidates could be seen as a form of bribery or influence peddling,  which are illegal acts.
 Among the choices,  {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Under state law Boca Co.  may reimburse the state directly for actual unemployment claims or it may pay 3 % of eligible gross wages.  Boca believes that actual unemployment claims will be 2 % of eligible gross wages and has chosen to reimburse the state.  Eligible gross wages are defined as the first $15000  of gross wages paid to each employee.  Boca had four employees each of whom earned $20000  during the year.  What amount should Boca report as accrued liability for unemployment claims in its year-end balance sheet?  Choices: a) $1,200  b) $1,600  c) $1,800  d) 2400  
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate the eligible gross wages for each employee. Eligible gross wages are defined as the first $15,000 of gross wages paid to each employee. Since each employee earned $20,000 during the year, the eligible gross wages for each employee are $15,000.
 Next, I need to calculate the total eligible gross wages for all four employees. The total eligible gross wages are 4 employees * $15,000 = $60,000.
 Now, I need to calculate the amount Boca should reimburse the state based on the chosen method. Boca believes that actual unemployment claims will be 2% of eligible gross wages, so the amount to be reimbursed is 2% * $60,000 = $1,200.
 Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following procedures would an auditor most likely complete to test the existence assertion of property,  plant and equipment?  Choices: a) Obtaining a listing of all current-year additions,  vouching significant additions to original invoices,  and determining that they have been placed in service.  b) Obtaining a detailed fixed-asset register and ensuring items are appropriately capitalized.  c) Obtaining a listing of current-year additions and verifying that items are recorded in the proper period.  d) Obtaining a detailed fixed-asset register and ensuring depreciation methods are applied consistently.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the procedure that is related to testing the existence assertion of property,  plant and equipment.  The existence assertion refers to the auditor verifying that the assets listed in the financial statements actually exist.
 Next,  I need to look at the choices and find the one that involves verifying the existence of the assets.  Choice a) mentions obtaining a listing of all current-year additions and vouching significant additions to original invoices,  which directly tests the existence of the assets.
 Choice b) is related to the accuracy assertion,  as it involves verifying that items are appropriately capitalized.
 Choice c) is also related to the accuracy assertion,  as it involves verifying that items are recorded in the proper period.
 Choice d) is related to the valuation and allocation assertion,  as it involves ensuring that depreciation methods are applied consistently.

 Output:
 First,  we need to identify the choice that does not allow an auditor to provide nonaudit services without impairing independence or preapproval.  Choice a) allows nonaudit services with revenues less than 5% of total revenues,  which does not impair independence.  Choice b) allows nonaudit services that were promptly brought to the attention of and approved by the audit committee,  which also does not impair independence.  Choice c) allows nonaudit services for financial information systems design and implementation,  which is a specific exception.  Choice d) allows services that the issuer did not recognize as nonaudit services at the time of the engagement,  which does not impair independence.

"Input: Which of the following applies to an accountant conducting a review of interim financial information?  Choices: a) The accountant must indicate in the report those circumstances in which generally accepted accounting principles have not been consistently observed in the current period in relation to the preceding period.  b) The accountant must express an opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole.  c) The accountant must maintain independence in mental attitude in all matters relating to the engagement.  d) The accountant must obtain sufficient appropriate evidence by performing procedures to afford a reasonable basis for an opinion.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the nature of the review of interim financial information.  This is a less comprehensive engagement than a standard audit,  where the accountant provides an opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole.  In a review,  the accountant focuses on specific issues or transactions.
 Next,  I need to consider the options provided and see which one is applicable to a review of interim financial information.  Option a) is related to a standard audit,  not a review.  Option b) is also related to a standard audit,  not a review.  Option c) is a requirement for all engagements,  not specific to a review of interim financial information.  Option d) is a requirement for a review of interim financial information,  as the accountant must obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for an opinion.

 Output:
 First, I need to determine the child's basis for the securities received from the parent. The child takes the adjusted basis of the securities from the parent, which is $10,000.
Next, I need to consider the child's actions after receiving the securities. The child sold the securities for $7,000.
To find the child's basis for the securities sold, I look at the amount the child received from the sale, which is $7,000.
Therefore, the child's basis for the securities sold is $7,000.

"Input: A CPA was engaged to calculate the rate of return on a specified investment according to an agreedupon formula and verify that the resultant percentage agrees to the percentage in an identified schedule.  The CPA's report on these agreed-upon procedures should contain Choices: a) An opinion about the fairness of the agreed-upon procedures.  b) A separate paragraph describing the effectiveness of the internal controls.  c) A disclaimer of responsibility for the sufficiency of those procedures.  d) A disclaimer of opinion on the fair presentation of the financial statements.  
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the purpose of an agreed-upon procedures engagement.  The CPA is not responsible for expressing an opinion on the fairness of the procedures (a) or the effectiveness of the internal controls (b).  The CPA's role is to perform the agreed-upon procedures and verify the results.
 Next,  we consider the disclaimer of responsibility.  The CPA is not responsible for the sufficiency of the procedures (c), as their responsibility is to perform the agreed-upon procedures and not to design or evaluate the procedures themselves.
 Finally,  we consider the disclaimer of opinion on the financial statements.  The CPA's report on agreed-upon procedures does not include a disclaimer of opinion on the fair presentation of the financial statements (d), as the CPA is verifying the results of the agreed-upon procedures, not the financial statements themselves.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: When comparing investment projects: Choices: a) The ranking of projects by NPV is invariant to changes in the market rate b) The IRR will always agree with NPV metric c) The IRR never changes the ranking of the projects d) We should use a single metric,  like the NPV or the IRR,  to have a coherent comparison 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the properties of NPV and IRR.  NPV is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows,  and it is not affected by changes in the market rate.  IRR is the discount rate that makes the NPV equal to zero.
 Next,  I need to consider the relationship between NPV and IRR.  While IRR and NPV often agree on the ranking of projects,  there are cases where they may disagree,  especially when dealing with multiple IRRs or when comparing projects with different sizes or cash flow patterns.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the given choices.  a) is true because NPV is not affected by changes in the market rate.  b) is not always true because IRR and NPV may disagree in certain cases.  c) is not true because IRR may change the ranking of projects in some situations.  d) is not necessarily true because using a single metric may not always provide a complete picture of the investment projects.

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  The Act prohibits accounting firms from providing nonaudit services to audit clients that could impair their independence.  However,  there are some exceptions to this rule.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice to see if it falls under an exception.  Choice a) and b) involve providing expert opinions to advocate the client's interests in litigation and regulatory investigations,  respectively.  These services could impair the accounting firm's independence,  so they are not permitted.
 Choice c) involves providing factual accounts in testimony explaining positions taken during the performance of any services provided to the client.  This service is considered to be consistent with the accounting firm's independence,  so it is permitted.
 Choice d) involves providing legal services to the client in a foreign jurisdiction.  This service could impair the accounting firm's independence,  so it is not permitted.

"Input: Match Co.  manufactures a product with the following costs per unit based on a maximum plant capacity of 400000  units per year: Direct materials $ 60  Direct labor 10  Variable overhead 40  Fixed overhead 30  Total $140  Match has a ready market for all 400000  units at a selling price of $200  each.  Selling costs in this market consist of $10  per unit shipping and a fixed licensing fee of $50000  per year.  Reno Co.  wishes to buy 5000  of these units on a special order.  There would be no shipping costs on this special order.  What is the lowest price per unit at which Match should be willing to sell the 5000  units to Reno?  Choices: a) $110  b) $140  c) $190  d) 200  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the relevant costs for the special order.  The relevant costs include direct materials,  direct labor,  variable overhead,  and fixed overhead.  The fixed overhead is relevant because it is a capacity constraint.  The selling costs are not relevant because there are no shipping costs on the special order.
 The relevant cost per unit is $60  (direct materials) + $10  (direct labor) + $40  (variable overhead) + $30  (fixed overhead) = $140  per unit.
 Therefore,  the lowest price per unit at which Match should be willing to sell the 5000  units to Reno is $140.

"Input: Pine Co.  purchased land for $450000  as a factory site.  An existing building on the site was razed before construction began.  Additional information is as follows: Cost of razing old building $60000  Title insurance and legal fees to purchase land $30000  Architect's fees $95000  New building construction cost $1850000  What amount should Pine capitalize as the cost of the completed factory building?  Choices: a) $2,005,000  b) $1,975,000  c) $1,945,000  d) 1910000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the total cost of the land.  The cost of the land is $450000,  and the title insurance and legal fees are $30000,  so the total cost of the land is $450000 + $30000 = $480000.
 Next,  I need to calculate the total cost of the building.  The cost of razing the old building is $60000,  the architect's fees are $95000,  and the construction cost is $1850000,  so the total cost of the building is $60000 + $95000 + $1850000 = $2005000.
 To find the total cost of the completed factory building,  I add the cost of the land and the cost of the building: $480000 + $2005000 = $2485000.
 However,  the question asks for the amount that Pine should capitalize as the cost of the completed factory building,  which means only the cost of the building is relevant.

"Input: A company has a parcel of land to be used for a future production facility.  The company applies the revaluation model under IFRS to this class of assets.  In year 1,  the company acquired the land for $100,000.  At the end of year 1,  the carrying amount was reduced to $90,000,  which represented the fair value at that date.  At the end of year 2,  the land was revalued,  and the fair value increased to $105,000.  How should the company account for the year 2  change in fair value?  Choices: a) By recognizing $10,000  in other comprehensive income.  b) By recognizing $15,000  in other comprehensive income.  c) By recognizing $15,000  in profit or loss.  d) By recognizing $10,000  in profit or loss and $5,000  in other comprehensive income.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the change in fair value from the end of year 1 to the end of year 2.  The fair value at the end of year 2 is $105,000,  and the fair value at the end of year 1 was $90,000,  so the change in fair value is $105,000 - $90,000 = $15,000.
 Next,  I need to consider the accounting treatment for the change in fair value under IFRS.  According to IFRS,  any increase in fair value should be recognized in other comprehensive income.
 Therefore,  the company should account for the year 2 change in fair value by recognizing $15,000  in other comprehensive income.

"Input: A 20 % target contribution margin is set for Duct which is a new product with the following unit costs: Manufacturing costs Variable $12  Fixed 8  Selling & admin.  Costs Variable $3  Fixed 5  What is Duct's target selling price?  Choices: a) $18.00  b) $18.75  c) $25.00  d) 33.6  
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate the total variable cost per unit. The variable manufacturing cost is $12, and the variable selling & admin. cost is $3, so the total variable cost is $12 + $3 = $15.
 Next, I need to calculate the total fixed cost per unit. The fixed manufacturing cost is $8, and the fixed selling & admin. cost is $5, so the total fixed cost is $8 + $5 = $13.
 The total cost per unit is the sum of the total variable cost and the total fixed cost: $15 + $13 = $28.
 The target contribution margin is 20% of the target selling price, so I can set up the equation: 0.20 * target selling price = total cost per unit.
 To find the target selling price, I divide the total cost per unit by 0.20: $28 ÷ 0.20 = $140.
 However, this is the target contribution margin, not the target selling price. To find the target selling price, I add the total cost per unit to the target contribution margin: $140 + $28 = $168.
 The closest answer choice to $168 is $18.75, so the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A company last paid a dividend of $3.  If the expected return on its equity is estimated at 12 % and its shares are currently quoted on London Stock Exchange at $75,  what should the dividend growth rate be to ensure that the price is consistent with the pricing of a growing perpetuity?  Choices: a) 0 % b) 8 % c) 16 % d) -4 % 
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the required rate of return using the dividend discount model.  The formula is: required rate of return = (last dividend * (1 + dividend growth rate)) / stock price + dividend growth rate.
 In this case,  the required rate of return is given as 12 %,  and the last dividend is $3.  The stock price is $75.
 So,  I can rewrite the formula as: 0.12 = (3 * (1 + dividend growth rate)) / 75 + dividend growth rate.
 Next,  I need to solve for the dividend growth rate.  I can rearrange the formula to isolate the dividend growth rate: 0.12 - dividend growth rate = (3 * (1 + dividend growth rate)) / 75.
 Multiplying both sides by 75 to eliminate the fraction,  I get: 9 - 0.75 * dividend growth rate = 3 + 3 * dividend growthThe correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

"Input: For an individual business owner,  which of the following would typically be classified as a capital asset for federal income tax purposes?  Choices: a) Accounts receivable b) Marketable securities c) Machinery and equipment used in a business d) Inventory 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the definition of a capital asset for federal income tax purposes.  A capital asset is an asset that is not used in a trade or business for the purpose of producing income. Instead, it is used for producing income in the future.

Second,  I need to evaluate each choice based on this definition.  a) Accounts receivable are amounts owed to the business by customers and are used in the business for producing income.  b) Marketable securities are financial assets that can be easily converted into cash and are used in the business for producing income.  c) Machinery and equipment used in a business are assets that are used in the business for producing income but are not intended to produce income in the future.  d) Inventory is goods held for sale in the ordinary course of business and is used in the business for producing income.

Third,  I need to identify which choice best fits the definition of a capital asset.  The only choice that fits the definition is c) Machinery and equipment used in a business.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: According to COSO,  which of the following is the most effective method to transmit a message of ethical behavior throughout an organization?

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the question and identify the most effective method to transmit a message of ethical behavior throughout an organization according to COSO.
 COSO,  or the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission,  is an independent,  non-profit organization that provides guidance on enterprise risk management,  internal control,  and fraud prevention.
 According to COSO,  the most effective method to transmit a message of ethical behavior throughout an organization is to demonstrate appropriate behavior by example.  This means that leaders should model the behavior they expect from others,  setting a clear standard of ethical conduct.

"Input: Bailey Co.  changed the accounting for insurance expense from the cash basis to the accrual basis in the current year.  In January of the prior year Bailey recorded insurance expense of $240000  for the cash purchase of a four-year insurance policy.  How should Bailey report the insurance transaction in the current year's financial statements?  Choices: a) As a $180000  debit to prepaid insurance.  b) As a $60000  debit to insurance expense.  c) As a $60000  debit to insurance expense a $120000  debit to prepaid asset and $180000  credit to retained earnings.  d) As a $180000  debit to insurance expense a $120000  credit to prepaid asset and $60000  credit to retained earnings.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the portion of the insurance policy that has been used in the current year.  Since the insurance policy is for four years and Bailey recorded the expense in January of the prior year,  one year has already passed.
 Next,  I need to calculate the monthly insurance expense.  The total cost of the insurance policy is $240000  for four years,  so the monthly expense is $240000  ÷ (4  * 12) = $5000  per month.
 For the current year,  Bailey should recognize the insurance expense for the portion of the policy that has been used.  Since one year has already passed,  Bailey should recognize the insurance expense for the remaining three years of the policy.  The total insurance expense for the remaining three years is $5000  * 12  * 3 = $180000.
 However,  since Bailey is changing to the accrual basis,  the prepaid insurance should be adjusted.  The prepaid insurance for the remaining three years is $5000  * 12  * 3 = $180000.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A company is considering a move to a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering instead of a traditional in-house application.  Which of the following concerns is unique to SaaS?  Choices: a) Disaster recovery capabilities and documented recovery procedures.  b) User credential setup and control over the actions that employees can perform.  c) Allocation of software expenses and overhead charged to departments.  d) Ownership of processed data and costs of data migrations.  
 Output:
 First,  I will analyze each concern in the context of SaaS and traditional in-house applications.
 a) Disaster recovery capabilities and documented recovery procedures:  Both SaaS and traditional applications have concerns about disaster recovery, but the implementation and documentation may differ.  SaaS providers typically handle disaster recovery, while in-house applications require the company to manage it.
 b) User credential setup and control over the actions that employees can perform:  Both SaaS and traditional applications require user management, but SaaS often provides more granular control over user permissions.
 c) Allocation of software expenses and overhead charged to departments:  This concern is relevant to both SaaS and traditional applications, as companies need to account for software expenses.
 d) Ownership of processed data and costs of data migrations:  This concern is unique to SaaS because SaaS providers own the data and handle data migrations, whereas in-house applications allow companies to own their data and manage migrations themselves.

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the situations that could potentially impair objectivity,  integrity,  or independence.  These situations often involve a close relationship or personal benefit that could lead to a conflict of interest.

Next,  I will evaluate each choice:

a) An auditor takes the client’s audit committee to Las Vegas for the weekend.  This situation could create a close relationship and personal benefit,  potentially leading to a conflict of interest.

b) An out-of-town client takes the audit engagement team out to dinner at a renowned local restaurant.  This situation is more neutral and does not necessarily imply a close relationship or personal benefit that could impair objectivity,  integrity,  or independence.

c) An auditor provides client management with box seats for the season at a major league baseball franchise.  This situation involves a personal benefit for the client,  potentially leading to a conflict of interest.

d) A client takes the audit engagement team on a two-day ski trip after the audit team worked for two consecutive weekends.  This situation could create a close relationship and personal benefit,  potentially leading to a conflict of interest.

Choices: a) Review that service auditor’s report on controls placed in operations.  b) Review the service auditor’s report and outline the accounting system in a memo to the working papers c) Audit the service organization’s controls,  assess risk,  and prepare the audit plan.  d) Audit the service organization’s controls to test the work of the service auditor.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the goal of the audit.  The user auditor is looking to create an efficient audit when an audit client uses a service organization for several processes.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  Choice a) involves reviewing the service auditor’s report on controls,  which could provide useful information.  Choice b) involves reviewing the service auditor’s report and outlining the accounting system,  which could also be helpful.  Choice c) involves auditing the service organization’s controls,  assessing risk,  and preparing the audit plan,  which is a comprehensive approach but may not be the most efficient.  Choice d) involves auditing the service organization’s controls to test the work of the service auditor,  which could be useful but may not address the overall efficiency of the audit.
 To create the most efficient audit,  the user auditor should focus on leveraging the work of the service auditor and using that information to guide their own audit plan.  Choice a) and b) both involve reviewing the service auditor’s work,  which can help the user auditor understand the controls and accounting system in place.  Choice c) is too comprehensive and may not be necessary,  while choice d) focuses too narrowly on testing the service auditor’s work rather than leveraging it for the overall efficiency of the audit.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: In the current year Vinton exchanged unimproved land for an apartment building.  The land had a basis of $300000  and a fair market value (FMV) of $420000  and was encumbered by a $100000  mortgage.  The apartment building had an FMV of $550000  and was encumbered by a $230000  mortgage.  Each party assumed the other's mortgage.  What is Vinton's basis in the office building?  Choices: a) $300,000  b) $320,000  c) $430,000  d) 550000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the adjusted basis of the land that Vinton exchanged.  The adjusted basis is the original basis minus any liabilities on the property.  So,  the adjusted basis of the land is $300000  - $100000  = $200000.
 Next,  I need to determine the total value of the apartment building after assuming the mortgage.  The FMV of the apartment building is $550000,  and Vinton assumed a $230000  mortgage,  so the total value is $550000  + $230000  = $780000.
 Now,  I need to calculate the portion of the total value that corresponds to the land's adjusted basis.  The ratio of the land's adjusted basis to the total value is $200000  ÷ $780000  ≈ 0.2564.
 Finally,  I need to apply this ratio to the total value of the apartment building to find Vinton's basis in the building.  So,  Vinton's basis in the building is 0.2564 * $780000 ≈ $199999.99, which rounds to $200000.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: When the operating effectiveness of a control is not evidenced by written documentation,  an auditor should obtain evidence about the control’s effectiveness by Choices: a) Mailing confirmations.  b) Inquiry and other procedures such as observation.  c) Analytical procedures.  d) Recalculating the balance in related accounts.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the question.  The question is asking about obtaining evidence about a control's effectiveness when there is no written documentation.
 Next,  I need to consider the available choices and their relevance to the context.  Mailing confirmations and recalculating the balance in related accounts are more relevant to financial statement audits and do not directly address the effectiveness of a control.  Analytical procedures can be useful for identifying trends and relationships but may not specifically address the effectiveness of a control.
 The most relevant choice is b) Inquiry and other procedures such as observation.  Inquiry involves asking questions to obtain information about the control, and observation involves watching the control in action to assess its effectiveness.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Lake Trust a simple trust reported the following items of income and expense during the year: Dividend income $2500  Taxable interest income 2000  Capital gains (allocable to corpus) 5000  Accounting fees (allocable to income) (500 ) Trustee fees (allocable to income) (750 ) What is Lake's distributable net income?  Choices: a) $9,500  b) $8,250  c) $5,000  d) 3250  
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate the total income. The income includes dividend income, taxable interest income, and capital gains (allocable to corpus). So the total income is $2500 + $2000 + $5000 = $9500.
 Next, I need to calculate the total expenses allocable to income. The expenses include accounting fees (allocable to income) and trustee fees (allocable to income). So the total expenses are $500 + $750 = $1250.
 To find the distributable net income, I subtract the total expenses from the total income: $9500 - $1250 = $8250.
 Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: An auditor of a nonissuer may not issue a qualified opinion when Choices: a) The auditor lacks independence with respect to the entity.  b) Management prevents the auditor from observing the entity's inventory.  c) The entity omits the statement of cash flows from its financial statements.  d) The auditor's report refers to the work of an actuary.  
 Output:
 First, let's consider the situation where the auditor lacks independence with respect to the entity.  If the auditor is not independent,  this could lead to a lack of objectivity and reliability in the audit.  A qualified opinion would not be appropriate in this case,  as it suggests that there is a limitation in the scope of the audit.  So,  option a) is a situation where an auditor may not issue a qualified opinion.
 Next, let's consider the situation where management prevents the auditor from observing the entity's inventory.  If the auditor is unable to observe the inventory,  this could lead to a lack of assurance in the financial statements.  A qualified opinion would not be appropriate in this case,  as it suggests that there is a limitation in the scope of the audit.  So,  option b) is a situation where an auditor may not issue a qualified opinion.
 Now, let's consider the situation where the entity omits the statement of cash flows from its financial statements.  While this is a significant omission,  it does not necessarily lead to a limitation in the scope of the audit.  A qualified opinion would not be appropriate in this case,  as it suggests a limitation in the scope of the audit.  So,  option c) is a situation where an auditor may not issue a qualified opinion.
 Finally, let's consider the situation where the auditor's report refers to the work of an actuary.  This is a neutral situation,  and it does not necessarily lead to a limitation in the scope of the audit.  A qualified opinion would not be appropriate in this case,  as it suggests a limitation in the scope of the audit.  So,  option d) is a situation where an auditor may not issue a qualified opinion.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following factors most likely would be considered an inherent limitation to an entity's internal control?  Choices: a) The ineffectiveness of the entity's audit committee.  b) Collusion of employees in circumventing internal controls.  c) The lack of resources to monitor internal controls.  d) The complexity of the entity's electronic order processing system.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the factors that are inherent limitations to an entity's internal control.  Inherent limitations are factors that cannot be completely eliminated by the implementation of internal controls.
 Next,  I can eliminate option b) Collusion of employees in circumventing internal controls,  as this is an external factor and not an inherent limitation.
 Then,  I can eliminate option d) The complexity of the entity's electronic order processing system,  as complexity can be managed through proper design and implementation of internal controls.
 Now,  I am left with options a) The ineffectiveness of the entity's audit committee and c) The lack of resources to monitor internal controls.  Both of these options are related to the internal environment and are considered inherent limitations.

"Input: The Houser Company has negotiated a $500,000  revolving credit agreement with Chitwood National Bank.  The agreement calls for an interest rate of 10 % on fund used,  a 15 % compensating balance,  and a commitment fee of 1 % on the unused amount of the credit line.  Assuming that the compensating balance would not otherwise be maintained,  the effective annual interest cost if the firm borrows $200,000  for one year is closest to Choices: a) 11.5  percent.  b) 15  percent.  c) 26.5  percent.  d) 13.53  percent.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the compensating balance.  The compensating balance is 15 % of the amount borrowed,  so it is 0.15 * 200,000 = 30,000  dollars.
 Next,  I need to calculate the net proceeds.  The net proceeds are the amount borrowed minus the compensating balance,  so it is 200,000 - 30,000 = 170,000  dollars.
 Now,  I need to calculate the interest cost.  The interest rate is 10 % of the amount borrowed,  so it is 0.10 * 200,000 = 20,000  dollars.
 To find the effective annual interest cost,  I divide the interest cost by the net proceeds and multiply by 100 to get a percentage: (20,000  ÷ 170,000) * 100 = 11.76  percent.
 The closest answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the nature of the acquisition costs.  In this case,  the costs are related to the purchase of the net assets of Dixon Co.,  which means they are not directly attributable to any specific asset.
 Next,  I need to consider the accounting standards for such costs.  According to accounting standards,  acquisition costs that are not directly attributable to specific assets should be allocated on a pro rata basis to the nonmonetary assets acquired.

"Input: Smith Legal Services has offered to represent a plaintiff in a lawsuit for a retainer of $20000  plus 40 % of any award over $20000.  Smith expects to incur out-of-pocket expenditures of $15000  in litigating the suit.  Possible court awards with their associated probabilities are: Award Probability $100000  0.7  $0  0.3  What is the expected value to Smith of the lawsuit?  Choices: a) $25,900  b) $27,400  c) $33,000  d) 37000  
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate the expected award amount. For the $100,000 award, the probability is 0.7, so the expected value is 0.7 * $100,000 = $70,000. For the $0 award, the probability is 0.3, so the expected value is 0.3 * $0 = $0. The total expected award amount is $70,000 + $0 = $70,000.
 Next, I need to calculate Smith's share of the expected award amount. Smith gets 40% of any award over $20,000. So, Smith's share is 0.4 * ($70,000 - $20,000) = 0.4 * $50,000 = $20,000.
 Now, I need to consider the retainer and out-of-pocket expenditures. The retainer is $20,000, and the out-of-pocket expenditures are $15,000. The total cost for Smith is $20,000 + $15,000 = $35,000.
 To find the expected value to Smith of the lawsuit, I subtract the total cost from Smith's share of the expected award amount: $20,000 - $35,000 = -$15,000.
 Therefore, the correct answer is not among the given choices. The expected value to Smith of the lawsuit is -$15,000.

If I need to sell the bond at the the end the third year,  when its prevailing price is 82,  what is my holding period return on this investment?  (Assume coupons are not reinvested. ) HINT: Accumulate all coupons.  Choices: a) 24 % b) 23 % c) -21 % d) 2 % 
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the total amount of coupons received over the three years.  The bond pays 8 % coupons,  so each year,  I receive 8  ÷ 100  * 100  = $8  in coupons.
 Over three years,  I receive 3  * $8  = $24  in coupons.
 Next,  I need to calculate the total amount received when selling the bond at the end of the third year.  The prevailing price is 82,  so I receive $82  when selling the bond.
 Now,  I need to calculate the total amount received from the investment,  including the coupons and the sale price.  The total amount is $24  + $82  = $106.
 To find the holding period return,  I divide the total amount received by the initial investment and subtract 1: ($106  ÷ $104.1  - 1) * 100  = 1.92 %.

"Input: What is the value of the tax shield if the value of the firm is $5  million,  its value if unlevered would be $4.78  million,  and the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs is $360,000?  Choices: a) $140,000  b) $220,000  c) $360,000  d) $580,000  
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate the value of the debt. The value of the firm is the sum of the value if unlevered and the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs: $5 million = $4.78 million + debt + $360,000. So, debt = $5 million - $4.78 million - $360,000 = $220,000.
 Next, I need to calculate the tax shield. The tax shield is the product of the debt and the tax rate. Since the problem does not provide a tax rate, I will assume a common tax rate of 30%. The tax shield is $220,000 * 0.30 = $66,000.
 Therefore, the correct answer is not listed in the choices provided. The closest option is {'sol': 'c') $360,000}, but it is not the correct calculation.

"Input: An auditor is using statistical sampling in testing whether cash disbursements were properly authorized.  The sample results indicate that the sample rate of deviation plus the allowance for sampling risk exceeds the tolerable rate.  Under these circumstances the auditor most likely would reduce the Choices: a) Planned reliance on the prescribed control.  b) Assessed level of control risk.  c) Planned reliance on substantive tests.  d) Tolerable rate of deviations.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the situation.  The auditor is using statistical sampling to test the proper authorization of cash disbursements.  The sample results show that the sample rate of deviation plus the allowance for sampling risk exceeds the tolerable rate.
 Next,  I need to consider the possible actions the auditor can take under these circumstances.  The auditor has four choices:
 a) Reduce the planned reliance on the prescribed control.
 b) Reduce the assessed level of control risk.
 c) Reduce the planned reliance on substantive tests.
 d) Reduce the tolerable rate of deviations.

 To determine the most likely action,  I need to consider the implications of each choice.  Choosing a) would mean that the auditor is less confident in the control and may need to perform more substantive tests.  Choosing b) would mean that the auditor is less confident in the overall control environment, which could affect other controls as well.  Choosing c) would mean that the auditor is already planning to perform fewer substantive tests, which may not be sufficient to address the identified risks.  Choosing d) would mean that the auditor is willing to accept a higher level of risk, which is not a recommended action.

 Based on the implications of each choice,  the most likely action for the auditor to take under these circumstances is to reduce the assessed level of control risk (b).  This choice acknowledges the identified risks and adjusts the overall assessment of the control environment, which is a more comprehensive approach to addressing the issue.

 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the question, which is about assessing an internal auditor's objectivity.
 Next,  I need to consider which of the given choices is most relevant to assessing objectivity.
 Option a) is about testing controls, which is important for understanding the effectiveness of internal controls but does not directly assess the objectivity of the internal auditor.
 Option b) is about analyzing risk factors related to misappropriation of assets, which is relevant to assessing the risk of material misstatement but does not directly assess the internal auditor's objectivity.
 Option c) is about reviewing the internal auditor's reports to verify consistency between procedures and conclusions. This is relevant to assessing the internal auditor's objectivity because it checks if the auditor is being consistent and unbiased in their work.
 Option d) is about policies that prohibit internal auditors from auditing areas with relatives in key management positions. This is also relevant to assessing objectivity because it helps to prevent conflicts of interest.

Considering the relevance to assessing objectivity, both options c) and d) are relevant. However, option c) is more directly related to the assessment of the internal auditor's work and consistency in their conclusions, which is a key aspect of objectivity. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: In the statement of activities for a governmental entity revenues such as charges for building permits garbage collection and dog licenses are reported as which of the following?  Choices: a) Program revenues in the category ‚ÄúCapital Grants and Contributions. ‚Äù b) Program revenues in the category ‚ÄúCharges for Services. ‚Äù c) General revenues in the category ‚ÄúCharges for Services. ‚Äù d) General revenues in the category ‚ÄúCapital Grants and Contributions. ‚Äù 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the nature of the revenues mentioned: charges for building permits,  garbage collection,  and dog licenses.  These are services provided by the government to the public.
 Next,  I need to consider the categories of revenues mentioned in the choices.  The categories are 'Capital Grants and Contributions' and 'Charges for Services'.
 'Capital Grants and Contributions' refers to one-time payments or grants given by the government, which do not represent services provided.  Therefore,  this category is not applicable to the revenues mentioned.
 'Charges for Services' refers to fees charged for services provided by the government.  Since the revenues mentioned are services provided by the government,  this category is applicable.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: How would the following ratios or measures be affected if a company issued additional capital stock for cash?  Total debt to total assets Working capital Choices: a) Increase Increase b) Increase Decrease c) Decrease Increase d) Decrease Decrease 
 Output:
 First,  let's consider the impact on total debt to total assets.  When a company issues additional capital stock for cash,  it receives cash,  which is an increase in assets.  At the same time,  there is no mention of any increase in debt.  So,  the total assets increase,  but total debt remains the same.
 Next,  let's consider the impact on working capital.  Working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities.  When the company issues additional capital stock for cash,  it increases its cash (a current asset).  This does not affect current liabilities.
 Therefore,  the total debt to total assets ratio would increase,  and working capital would remain unchanged or could potentially increase depending on the current assets and liabilities before the issuance of additional capital stock.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following statements is the most significant characteristic in determining the classification of an enterprise fund?  Choices: a) The predominant customer is the primary government.  b) The pricing policies of the activity establish fees and charges designed to recover its cost.  c) The activity is financed by debt that is secured partially by a pledge of the net revenues from fees and charges of the activity.  d) Laws or regulations require that the activity’s costs of providing services including capital costs be recovered with taxes or similar revenues.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of an enterprise fund.  An enterprise fund is a governmental fund that is accounted for like a business,  with its own source of revenue and debt.  The most significant characteristic in determining the classification of an enterprise fund should be related to its business-like nature.

Next,  I will evaluate each statement based on its relevance to the business-like nature of an enterprise fund.

a) The predominant customer is the primary government.  This statement is related to the government's involvement,  but it does not necessarily define the business-like nature of the enterprise fund.

b) The pricing policies of the activity establish fees and charges designed to recover its cost.  This statement is related to the business-like aspect,  as it describes how the enterprise fund operates to recover its costs.

c) The activity is financed by debt that is secured partially by a pledge of the net revenues from fees and charges of the activity.  This statement is related to the financing aspect,  but it does not directly define the business-like nature of the enterprise fund.

d) Laws or regulations require that the activity’s costs of providing services including capital costs be recovered with taxes or similar revenues.  This statement is related to the requirement for the enterprise fund to recover its costs,  which is a business-like characteristic.

After evaluating each statement,  I conclude that the most significant characteristic in determining the classification of an enterprise fund is the pricing policies of the activity,  as it directly defines the business-like nature of the enterprise fund.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Rune Co. 's checkbook balance on December 31  was $10000.  On that date Rune held the following items in its safe: $4000  check payable to Rune postdated January 3  and not included in the December 31  checkbook balance in collection of a sale made in December.  $1000  check payable to Rune deposited December 15  and included in the December 31  checkbook balance but returned by the bank on December 30  stamped ""NSF"".  The check was redeposited on January 2  and cleared on January 9.  What amount should Rune report as cash in its December 31  balance sheet?  Choices: a) $9,000  b) $10,000  c) $13,000  d) 14000  
 Output:
 First,  we need to consider the items in the safe that are relevant to the December 31  balance sheet.  The $4000  check postdated January 3  is already included in the checkbook balance,  so it does not affect the December 31  cash amount.
 The $1000  check deposited December 15  but returned ""NSF"" on December 30  is initially included in the checkbook balance,  but since it was returned ""NSF"",  it should not be included in the December 31  cash amount.
 The check was redeposited on January 2  and cleared on January 9,  but these events do not affect the December 31  cash amount because the check was not included in the December 31  checkbook balance due to the ""NSF"" return.
 Therefore,  the amount Rune should report as cash in its December 31  balance sheet is the checkbook balance minus the $1000  NSF check: $10000  - $1000  = $9000.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following procedures would an auditor most likely perform to obtain evidence about the occurrence of subsequent events?  Choices: a) Verify inventory pledged under loan agreements by confirming the details with financial institutions.  b) Inquire about the current status of transactions that were recorded on the basis of preliminary data.  c) Compare the financial statements being reported on with those of the prior year.  d) Trace information from shipping documents to sales invoices and sales journal transactions.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what subsequent events are.  Subsequent events are events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued.  These events may affect the financial statements.
 Next,  I need to identify which procedure would help the auditor obtain evidence about the occurrence of these subsequent events.  The auditor needs to find out if there were any events that happened after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements were issued.
 Looking at the choices,  I see that option b) Inquire about the current status of transactions that were recorded on the basis of preliminary data.  This option directly asks about the status of transactions that happened after the balance sheet date.  This would help the auditor obtain evidence about the occurrence of subsequent events.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: The following information pertains to Baxter Co: Inventory at beginning of year $200000  Inventory at year end $300000  Cost of goods sold during the year $500000  What was Baxter's inventory turnover for the year?  Choices: a) 1  b) 1.5  c) 2  d) 2.5  
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate the average inventory for the year. The average inventory is the sum of the beginning and ending inventories divided by 2: ($200,000 + $300,000) / 2 = $250,000.
Next, I need to calculate the inventory turnover ratio. The inventory turnover ratio is the cost of goods sold divided by the average inventory: $500,000 / $250,000 = 2.
Therefore, Baxter's inventory turnover for the year is 2, which corresponds to option c) 2.
The answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: In planning an audit,  the auditor's knowledge about the design of relevant internal control activities should be used to Choices: a) Identify the types of potential misstatements that could occur.  b) Assess the operational efficiency of internal control.  c) Determine whether controls have been circumvented by collusion.  d) Document the assessed level of control risk.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the purpose of the auditor's knowledge about the design of internal control activities.  The auditor's knowledge is used to understand the structure of the internal controls and how they are designed to prevent or detect misstatements.
 Next,  I need to consider the options provided and see which one aligns with the purpose of the auditor's knowledge.  Option a) Identify the types of potential misstatements that could occur,  aligns with the purpose of understanding the design of internal controls.
 Option b) Assess the operational efficiency of internal control,  is not directly related to the design of internal controls,  but rather to their effectiveness.
 Option c) Determine whether controls have been circumvented by collusion,  is more about evaluating the actual performance of internal controls rather than their design.
 Option d) Document the assessed level of control risk,  is a step that comes after identifying the potential misstatements,  and is more about evaluating the risk based on the identified misstatements.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Prime Corp.  is an accrual-basis calendar-year C corporation.  Its current-year reported book income before federal income taxes was $300000  which included $17000  corporate bond interest income.  A $20000  expense for term life insurance premiums on corporate officers was incurred.  Prime was the policy owner and beneficiary.  What was Prime's current-year taxable income as reconciled on Prime's Schedule M-1  Reconciliation of Income (Loss) per Books With Income per Return of Form 1120  U. S.  Corporation Income Tax Return?  Choices: a) $320,000  b) $300,000  c) $283,000  d) 280000  
 Output:
 First,  we need to adjust the book income for the differences between book income and taxable income.  The corporate bond interest income is not taxable,  so we need to subtract it from the book income.  The book income is $300000,  so after subtracting the interest income of $17000,  we have $300000 - $17000 = $283000.
 Next,  we need to consider the term life insurance premiums.  Since Prime was the policy owner and beneficiary,  this expense is not deductible for tax purposes.  So,  we need to add this expense to the adjusted book income.  The adjusted book income is $283000,  so after adding the insurance premiums of $20000,  we have $283000 + $20000 = $303000.
 Therefore,  Prime's current-year taxable income as reconciled on Prime's Schedule M-1  Reconciliation of Income (Loss) per Books With Income per Return of Form 1120  U. S.  Corporation Income Tax Return is $303000.  However,  this choice is not among the given options.  There might be a mistake in the question or the provided choices.  So,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'None of the given options'}"
"Input: If the correlation between Securities A and B is −0.20,  and their respective standard deviations are 8 % and 18 %,  what is the standard deviation of a portfolio with one quarter invested in A and three quarters invested in B?  Choices: a) 8.70 % b) 13.20 % c) 54 % d) 6.60 % 
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the weighted average of the standard deviations.  Since one quarter is invested in A and three quarters is invested in B,  the weighted average is (0.25 * 8 %) + (0.75 * 18 %) = 2 % + 13.5 % = 15.5 %.
 Next,  I need to calculate the portfolio's standard deviation using the formula: σp = √(wA^2 * σA^2 + wB^2 * σB^2 + 2 * wA * wB * ρAB * σA * σB), where σp is the portfolio's standard deviation, wA and wB are the weights of securities A and B, σA and σB are the standard deviations of securities A and B, and ρAB is the correlation between securities A and B.
 Plugging in the values,  I get: σp = √((0.25^2 * 8 %^2) + (0.75^2 * 18 %^2) + (2 * 0.25 * 0.75 * −0.20 * 8 % * 18 %)) = √(4 %^2 + 106.125 %^2 + −13.5 %^2) = √(179.625 %^2) = 13.4 %.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: During the current year Cooley Co.  had an unrealized gain of $100000  on a debt investment classified as available-for-sale.  Cooley's corporate tax rate is 25 %.  What amount of the gain should be included in Cooley's net income and other comprehensive income at the end of the current year?  Net income Other comprehensive income Choices: a) $100000  $0  b) $75000  $25000  c) $25000  $75000  d) $0  $75000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the unrealized gain on the debt investment.  The gain is $100000.
 Next,  I need to consider the corporate tax rate.  The tax rate is 25 %.
 To find the amount of the gain that should be included in net income,  I need to calculate the tax on the gain.  The tax on the gain is 25 % of $100000,  which is 0.25  * $100000  = $25000.
 The amount of the gain that should be included in net income is the gain minus the tax on the gain: $100000  - $25000  = $75000.
 The amount of the gain that should be included in other comprehensive income is the gain itself,  since it is unrealized: $100000.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: You are told an investment will generate income that grows at 5 % p. a.  forever when the market discount rate is 15 %.  If the investment’s next payout is $10,  what is the value of the investment?  Choices: a) $1  b) $500  c) $100  d) $200  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand that the investment's value can be calculated using the Gordon Growth Model, which is used for valuing a stock that pays a constant dividend and grows at a constant rate. The formula is: Value = Next_Payout / (Discount_Rate - Growth_Rate).
 In this case, the next payout is $10, the discount rate is 15% (0.15), and the growth rate is 5% (0.05).
 Plugging these values into the formula, I get: Value = $10 / (0.15 - 0.05) = $10 / 0.10 = $100.
 Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following matters is included in a typical comfort letter?  Choices: a) Negative assurance on whether unaudited condensed financial information complies in form with the accounting requirements of the SEC.  b) An opinion on whether any fraud risk factors indicate significant incentive and opportunity relating to fraudulent financial reporting.  c) Positive assurance on whether there has been any change in capital stock or long-term debt since the date of the audited financial statements.  d) An opinion on whether the entity's internal control components are operating as designed in achieving their stated objectives.  
 Output:
 First, let's consider what a comfort letter is. A comfort letter, also known as a letter of comfort, is a letter from an auditor to a client's lender or other third parties, stating that the auditor has conducted a limited review of the client's financial statements and has not identified any significant issues that would prevent the lender from relying on the financial statements.

Now, let's analyze the choices:

a) This choice talks about unaudited condensed financial information and compliance with SEC accounting requirements, which is not the primary focus of a comfort letter.

b) This choice mentions an opinion on fraud risk factors, which is not the purpose of a comfort letter.

c) This choice discusses positive assurance on changes in capital stock or long-term debt, which is relevant to the comfort letter as it addresses potential changes that could affect the financial statements.

d) This choice is about an opinion on internal control components, which is not the main focus of a comfort letter.

Based on the analysis, the matter included in a typical comfort letter is the positive assurance on whether there has been any change in capital stock or long-term debt since the date of the audited financial statements. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following characteristics most likely would heighten an auditor's concern about the risk of material misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting?  Choices: a) Management displays a significant disregard for regulatory authorities.  b) There is a lack of turnover of employees in the accounting department.  c) Monthly bank reconciliations usually include several deposits in transit.  d) Equipment is usually sold at a loss before being fully depreciated.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider which choice indicates a potential for fraudulent financial reporting.  Management displaying a significant disregard for regulatory authorities (a) could be a red flag for fraudulent activities, as they may be willing to break rules to manipulate financial statements.
 Next,  I consider the lack of turnover of employees in the accounting department (b).  A stable workforce can be a concern,  as it may allow individuals to hide fraudulent activities for a longer period without being detected.
 The option of monthly bank reconciliations usually including several deposits in transit (c) is a normal occurrence and does not necessarily indicate fraudulent activities.
 Finally,  equipment being sold at a loss before being fully depreciated (d) could be a sign of intentional misstatement,  as it may be an attempt to reduce reported profits or hide assets.
 Among these choices,  both (a) and (b) indicate potential concerns related to fraudulent financial reporting.  However,  (a) is more directly related to a disregard for regulatory rules,  which is a stronger indicator of fraudulent activities.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

"Input: Kanji Company had sales last year of $265  million,  including cash sales of $25  million.  If its average collection period was 36  days,  its ending accounts receivable balance is closest to .  (Assume a 365 -day year. ) Choices: a) $26.1  million b) $23.7  million c) $7.4  million d) $18.7  million 
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the credit sales.  The total sales are $265  million,  and the cash sales are $25  million,  so the credit sales are $265  - $25  = $240  million.
 Next,  I need to find the average accounts receivable per day.  The average collection period is 36  days,  so the average accounts receivable per day is $240  million ÷ 365  days = $0.6575  million per day.
 Finally,  I need to find the ending accounts receivable balance for the year.  Since the average accounts receivable per day is $0.6575  million,  the ending accounts receivable balance is $0.6575  million per day * 365  days = $23.99  million.
 The closest answer is $23.7  million,  so the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Palmyra Co.  has net income of $11,000,  a positive $1,000  net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle,  a $3,000  unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities,  a positive $2,000  foreign currency translation adjustment,  and a $6,000  increase in its common stock.  What amount is Palmyra’s comprehensive income?  Choices: a) $4,000  b) $10,000  c) $11,000  d) $17,000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the net income.  The net income is given as $11,000.
 Next,  I need to consider the net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle,  which is a positive $1,000.  This adjustment is added to the net income.
 Now,  I need to consider the unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities,  which is $3,000.  This loss is not included in the calculation of comprehensive income,  as it is an unrealized loss.
 Then,  I need to consider the positive $2,000 foreign currency translation adjustment.  This adjustment is added to the net income.
 Finally,  I need to consider the $6,000 increase in common stock.  This increase is not included in the calculation of comprehensive income,  as it is a change in equity that does not result from a transaction with owners.
 To find the comprehensive income,  I add the net income,  the net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle,  and the foreign currency translation adjustment: $11,000  + $1,000  + $2,000  = $14,000.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: On October 31,  year 1,  a company with a calendar year-end paid $90,000  for services that will be performed evenly over a sixmonth period from November 1,  year 1,  through April 30,  year 2.  The company expensed the $90,000  cash payment in October,  year 1,  to its services expense general ledger account.  The company did not record any additional journal entries in year 1  related to the payment.  What is the adjusting journal entry that the company should record to properly report the prepayment in its year 1  financial statements?  Choices: a) Debit prepaid services and credit services expense for $30,000.  b) Debit prepaid services and credit services expense for $60,000.  c) Debit services expense and credit prepaid services for $30,000.  d) Debit services expense and credit prepaid services for $60,000.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the portion of the payment that should be expensed in year 1.  The services were paid for from November 1,  year 1,  to April 30,  year 2,  which is a total of 7 months.  The year 1 only includes November and December,  which is a total of 2 months.
 Next,  I need to calculate the monthly expense.  The total payment was $90,000  for a 6-month period,  so the monthly expense is $90,000  ÷ 6  = $15,000.
 Now,  I need to calculate the expense for year 1.  Since year 1 includes 2 months,  the expense for year 1 is $15,000  * 2  = $30,000.
 The adjusting journal entry should recognize the expense for year 1 and reduce the prepaid services account.  So,  the correct entry is to debit prepaid services and credit services expense for $30,000.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following should a practitioner perform as part of an engagement for agreed-upon procedures in accordance with Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements?

 Next,  I need to consider the choices and which one is relevant to the purpose of the engagement.  Choice a) is relevant because the practitioner is required to issue a report on the findings based on the specified procedures performed.
 Choice b) is not directly relevant because the practitioner's responsibility is to perform the agreed-upon procedures, not to assess whether the procedures meet the needs of the parties.
 Choice c) is not relevant because the practitioner is not required to express negative assurance on the findings of work performed in an agreed-upon procedures engagement.
 Choice d) is not relevant because the practitioner is not required to report the differences between agreed-upon and audit procedures in an agreed-upon procedures engagement.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

Choices: a) Total current net assets and total other assets.  b) Total current assets and restricted assets.  c) Unrestricted net assets,  temporarily restricted net assets,  and permanently restricted net assets.  d) Unrestricted net assets,  restricted net assets,  and total current assets.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what total net assets represent in the statement of financial position for a nongovernmental not-for-profit organization.  Total net assets are the difference between total assets and total liabilities,  and they are divided into different categories based on their restrictions.
 Next,  I need to analyze the choices given.  Choice a) includes total current net assets and total other assets,  but it does not specify the categories of net assets.

"Input: According to the Bond Equivalent Yield (BEY) method,  the yield on a $1,000,  13 -week US Treasury bill purchased for $960  would be closest to .  Choices: a) 16.0  percent b) 16.7  percent c) 17.0  percent d) 17.8  percent 
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the discount on the Treasury bill.  The discount is the difference between the face value and the purchase price: $1,000 - $960 = $40.
 Next,  I need to calculate the BEY.  The formula for BEY is (discount ÷ purchase price) * (365 ÷ days to maturity).  In this case,  the days to maturity are 13  weeks,  which is equivalent to 91  days.
 So,  the BEY is ($40 ÷ $960) * (365 ÷ 91) = 0.166667 * 4 = 6.6667%.
 To convert this to a percentage,  I multiply by 100: 6.6667 * 100 = 666.67%.
 Finally,  I round this to the nearest tenth of a percent: 666.67% ≈ 16.7%.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

 First,  we need to consider the nature of the payable.  In this case,  it is a payable to the parent company,  which means it is an intercompany payable.
 Next,  we need to consider the type of balance sheet.  There are two types mentioned:  Strut's balance sheet and the consolidated balance sheet.
 The consolidated balance sheet combines the financial statements of all companies in a group,  eliminating intercompany transactions and balances.  So,  an intercompany payable should be eliminated in the consolidated balance sheet.

A description of how that basis differs from GAAP should be included in the Choices: a) Notes to the financial statements.  b) Auditor’s engagement letter.  c) Management representation letter.  d) Introductory paragraph of the auditor’s report.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the difference between the income tax basis and GAAP.  The income tax basis is a set of accounting rules used for tax purposes that may differ from GAAP,  which is the generally accepted accounting principles used for financial reporting.
 Next,  I need to identify where the difference should be disclosed.  The disclosure should be made to provide transparency and inform users of the financial statements about the basis used.
 Finally,  I need to match the disclosure requirement with the correct choice.  The correct choice is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Lind Co. 's salaries expense of $10,000  is paid every other Friday for the 10  workdays then ending.  Lind's employees do not work on Saturdays and Sundays.  The last payroll was paid on June 18.  On Wednesday,  June 30,  the month-end balance in the salaries expense account before accruals was $14,000.  What amount should Lind report as salaries expense in its income statement for the month ended June 30?  Choices: a) $24,000  b) $22,000  c) $20,000  d) $18,000  
 Output:
 First, I need to determine the number of workdays in June that have passed since the last payroll. Since the last payroll was on June 18 and the current date is June 30, there are 13 workdays in total (excluding weekends).
Next, I need to calculate the total salaries expense for these 13 workdays. Since the salaries expense is paid every other Friday, there are 6 paydays in June (13 workdays / 2). Each payday covers 2 workdays, so the total salaries expense for these 13 workdays is 6 paydays * $10,000 per payday = $60,000.
Now, I need to adjust the month-end balance in the salaries expense account before accruals. The month-end balance is $14,000, which means there is an additional $14,000 of salaries expense that has been incurred but not yet paid.
To find the total salaries expense to be reported in the income statement for the month ended June 30, I add the total salaries expense for the 13 workdays to the additional accrued salaries expense: $60,000 + $14,000 = $74,000.
However, since the question asks for the amount to be reported in the income statement, we need to consider the salaries expense that was already included in the month-end balance before accruals. This means we subtract the initial month-end balance of $14,000 from the total salaries expense: $74,000 - $14,000 = $60,000.
Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following statements is correct as it relates to changes in accounting estimates?  Choices: a) Most changes in accounting estimates are accounted for retrospectively.  b) Whenever it is impossible to determine whether a change in an estimate or a change in accounting principle occurred,  the change should be considered a change in principle.  c) Whenever it is impossible to determine whether a change in accounting estimate or a change in accounting principle has occurred,  the change should be considered a change in estimate.  d) It is easier to differentiate between a change in accounting estimate and a change in accounting principle than it is to differentiate between a change in accounting estimate and a correction of an error.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the difference between a change in accounting estimate,  a change in accounting principle,  and a correction of an error.  A change in accounting estimate is a change in the estimated amount of an asset or liability,  such as depreciation or warranty expenses.  A change in accounting principle is a change in the method of accounting for an item,  such as switching from FIFO to LIFO.  A correction of an error is a change made to correct a mistake in the previous financial statements.
 Next,  I need to consider the impact of these changes on the financial statements.  Most changes in accounting estimates are accounted for prospectively,  meaning they are applied going forward from the date of the change.  A change in accounting principle is accounted for retrospectively,  meaning it is applied to all prior periods presented.  A correction of an error is also accounted for retrospectively.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  Choice a) is incorrect because most changes in accounting estimates are accounted for prospectively,  not retrospectively.  Choice b) is incorrect because if it is impossible to determine whether a change is an estimate or a principle,  the change should be considered a change in estimate,  not a principle.  Choice c) is correct because it accurately describes the situation where it is impossible to determine whether a change is an estimate or a principle.  Choice d) is incorrect because differentiating between a change in estimate and a change in principle is generally more difficult than differentiating between a change in estimate and a correction of an error.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A partner in a general partnership is usually not entitled to which of the following?  Choices: a) To participate in management.  b) To review accounting records.  c) To enter into a contract with a third party without the consent of the other partners.  d) To be liable only for personal negligence.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the nature of a general partnership.  In a general partnership,  partners have the right to participate in management and review accounting records.  They can also enter into contracts with third parties,  but they must obtain the consent of the other partners.  Finally,  a partner in a general partnership is liable for the actions of the partnership,  not just for personal negligence.

Now,  I will go through the choices and eliminate those that are applicable to a general partner.  a) To participate in management - This is true,  as partners can participate in management.  b) To review accounting records - This is also true,  as partners have access to accounting records.  c) To enter into a contract with a third party without the consent of the other partners - This is false,  as partners must obtain the consent of the other partners to enter into contracts with third parties.  d) To be liable only for personal negligence - This is false,  as partners are liable for the actions of the partnership,  not just for personal negligence.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following matters does an auditor usually include in the engagement letter?  Choices: a) Arrangements regarding fees and billing.  b) Analytical procedures that the auditor plans to perform.  c) Indications of negative cash flows from operating activities.  d) Identification of working capital deficiencies.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify which of the choices is typically included in an engagement letter.  An engagement letter is a document that outlines the terms and conditions of the engagement between the auditor and the client.
 The correct answer is a) Arrangements regarding fees and billing.  This is because the engagement letter usually includes the terms of the engagement,  which may include the fees and billing arrangements.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: In the financial statements of employee benefit pension plans and trusts,  the plan investments are reported at Choices: a) Fair value.  b) Historical cost.  c) Net realizable value.  d) Lower of historical cost or market.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the accounting principles for plan investments in employee benefit pension plans and trusts.  These plans are required to report their investments at a specific value.
 Next,  I will evaluate each option:
 a) Fair value - This is the correct option.  Employee benefit pension plans and trusts are required to report their investments at fair value.
 b) Historical cost - This is not the correct option.  Historical cost is not the appropriate basis for reporting plan investments in these types of entities.
 c) Net realizable value - This is not the correct option.  While this may be relevant for some other types of assets, it is not the basis for reporting plan investments in employee benefit pension plans and trusts.
 d) Lower of historical cost or market - This is not the correct option.  The lower of historical cost or market is not the basis for reporting plan investments in these types of entities.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: An accountant compiles the financial statements of a nonissuer and issues the standard compilation report.  Although not specifically stated in this report,  it is implied that Choices: a) The accountant has not audited or reviewed the financial statements.  b) Substantially all disclosures required by GAAP are included in the financial statements.  c) The financial statements should not be used to obtain credit.  d) The compilation is limited to presenting information that is the representation of management.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the nature of the compilation report.  A compilation report is a service where the accountant prepares the financial statements based on information provided by management,  presenting the information as management's representation.
 Next,  I need to consider the implications of the compilation report for the users of the financial statements.  Since it is a compilation,  the accountant has not audited or reviewed the financial statements,  so there is no assurance provided about the accuracy or completeness of the information.
 Now,  I need to identify which choice is consistent with the nature of the compilation report.  Choice a) is correct because it states that the accountant has not audited or reviewed the financial statements,  which is true for a compilation report.
 Choice b) is not necessarily true for a compilation report,  as the accountant does not guarantee that all disclosures required by GAAP are included.
 Choice c) is not directly implied by the compilation report,  as the accountant does not restrict the use of the financial statements for obtaining credit.
 Choice d) is consistent with the nature of the compilation report,  as it states that the compilation is limited to presenting information that is the representation of management,  which is true for a compilation report.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Plaid Pants,  Inc.  common stock has a beta of 0.90,  while Acme Dynamite Company common stock has a beta of 1.80.  The expected return on the market is 10  percent,  and the risk-free rate is 6  percent.  According to the capital-asset pricing model (CAPM) and making use of the information above,  the required return on Plaid Pants' common stock should be ,  and the required return on Acme's common stock should be .  Choices: a) 3.6  percent; 7.2  percent b) 9.6  percent; 13.2  percent c) 9.0  percent; 18.0  percent d) 14.0  percent; 23.0  percent 
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the required return for Plaid Pants,  Inc.  using the CAPM formula: Required return = Risk-free rate + Beta * (Market return - Risk-free rate).
 For Plaid Pants,  Inc.,  the required return is 6  + 0.90 * (10  - 6) = 6  + 0.90 * 4  = 6  + 3.6  = 9.6  percent.
 Next,  I need to calculate the required return for Acme Dynamite Company using the same formula: Required return = Risk-free rate + Beta * (Market return - Risk-free rate).
 For Acme Dynamite Company,  the required return is 6  + 1.80 * (10  - 6) = 6  + 1.80 * 4  = 6  + 7.2  = 13.2  percent.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A company invested in a new machine that will generate revenues of $35,000  annually for seven years.  The company will have annual operating expenses of $7,000  on the new machine.  Depreciation expense,  included in the operating expenses,  is $4,000  per year.  The expected payback period for the new machine is 5.2  years.  What amount did the company pay for the new machine?  Choices: a) $145,600  b) $161,200  c) $166,400  d) $182,000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the net annual revenue by subtracting the operating expenses,  including depreciation,  from the total annual revenue: $35,000  - ($7,000  + $4,000) = $24,000  net annual revenue.
 Next,  I need to calculate the annual cash flow by adding the depreciation expense back to the net annual revenue,  since depreciation is a non-cash expense: $24,000  + $4,000  = $28,000  annual cash flow.
 To find the initial investment,  I multiply the annual cash flow by the expected payback period: $28,000  * 5.2  years = $145,600.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following items is not subject to the application of intraperiod income tax allocation?  Choices: a) Discontinued operations b) Income from continuing operations.  c) Extraordinary gains and losses d) Operating income.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what intraperiod income tax allocation is.  Intraperiod income tax allocation refers to the process of allocating income tax expense to different components of income or loss in the same period.
 Next,  I need to consider which of the given items are not subject to this process.  Discontinued operations (a) are not subject to intraperiod income tax allocation because they are reported separately from continuing operations.  Income from continuing operations (b), extraordinary gains and losses (c), and operating income (d) are all subject to intraperiod income tax allocation.

"Input: Skytop Co.  a nonprofit entity is considering acquiring a machine for $80000  that will produce uniform cash inflows of $25000  for four years.  Skytop evaluates capital projects using discounted cash flows at a cost of capital of 10 % per year.  Based upon the following table what action should Skytop take regarding acquisition of the machine and why?  Future value of $1  for 4  years at 10 % $1.464  Present value of $1  for 4  years at 10 % $0.683  Future value of $1  ordinary annuity for 4  years at 10 % $4.641  Present value of $1  ordinary annuity for 4  years at 10 % $3.170  Acquire: Reason: Choices: a) Yes Net cash flow is $20000  b) Yes Net future value is $36025  c) No Net present value is ($750 ) d) No Net present value is ($8750 ) 
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the present value of the cash inflows.  The cash inflows are $25000  per year for four years,  so the present value is 25000  * 3.170  = 79250  dollars.
 Next,  I need to calculate the net present value (NPV) of the project.  The NPV is the present value of the cash inflows minus the initial investment: 79250  - 80000  = -750  dollars.
 The NPV is negative,  which means the project does not meet the required rate of return.
 Therefore,  the correct action is to not acquire the machine.

"Input: In return for a 20 % partnership interest,  Skinner contributed $5,000  cash and land with a $12,000  basis and a $20,000  fair market value to the partnership.  The land was subject to a $10,000  mortgage that the partnership assumed.  In addition,  the partnership had $20,000  in recourse liabilities that would be shared by partners according to their partnership interests.  What amount represents Skinner’s basis in the partnership interest?  Choices: a) $27,000  b) $21,000  c) $19,000  d) $13,000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the total amount contributed by Skinner to the partnership.  Skinner contributed $5,000  cash and land with a $12,000  basis,  so the total contribution is $5,000  + $12,000  = $17,000.
 Next,  I need to consider the mortgage assumed by the partnership.  The land was subject to a $10,000  mortgage that the partnership assumed,  so Skinner's share of the mortgage is 20% of $10,000,  which is $10,000  * 0.20 = $2,000.
 Now,  I need to consider the recourse liabilities shared by the partners.  The partnership had $20,000  in recourse liabilities that would be shared by partners according to their partnership interests,  so Skinner's share of the recourse liabilities is 20% of $20,000,  which is $20,000  * 0.20 = $4,000.
 To find Skinner's basis in the partnership interest,  I add the total contribution,  the share of the mortgage,  and the share of the recourse liabilities: $17,000  + $2,000  + $4,000  = $23,000.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

During the month,  the company has sales of $200,000  and returns of sales made in prior months of $5,000.  What amount should the company record as net sales revenue for new sales made during the month?  Choices: a) $185,000  b) $190,000  c) $195,000  d) $200,000  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the expected returns for the current month's sales.  The company estimates that 5 % of sales will be returned,  so the expected returns for the $200,000  in sales are 0.05 * $200,000  = $10,000.
 Next,  I need to consider the returns from prior months,  which are $5,000.
 The total returns for the month are $10,000  + $5,000  = $15,000.
 To find the net sales revenue for new sales made during the month,  I subtract the total returns from the total sales: $200,000  - $15,000  = $185,000.

What amount of consigned inventory should be included in Stone's December 31  year 1  balance sheet?  Choices: a) $24,000  b) $25,000  c) $36,000  d) 37800  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the consignment transactions that affected Stone's inventory.  Stone shipped $36000  of inventory to Omega Co.  and paid $1800  in freight.  This means Stone is responsible for the inventory and freight costs, so the total cost for Stone is $36000  + $1800  = $37800.
 Next,  Stone received $24000  of inventory from Gamma Co.  and paid $1000  in freight.  However,  since no sales of consigned goods were made, this inventory is not yet included in Stone's inventory.
 Therefore,  the amount of consigned inventory that should be included in Stone's December 31  year 1  balance sheet is $37800.

"Input: Dawn Corp.  uses a standard cost system.  During the year both the labor rate variance and the labor efficiency variance were unfavorable.  Dawn wrote the variances off directly to cost of goods sold.  If Dawn had allocated the variances to work in process finished goods and cost of goods sold instead what would have been the effects on current ratio and net income?  Current Net ratio income Choices: a) Increases Increases b) Increases Decreases c) Decreases Increases d) Decreases Decreases 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the effect of writing off the variances directly to cost of goods sold. An unfavorable labor rate variance means Dawn Corp. paid more for labor than expected, and an unfavorable labor efficiency variance means they used more labor than expected. Both variances increase the cost of goods sold, which in turn decreases net income.

Now, if Dawn had allocated the variances to work in process, finished goods, and cost of goods sold, the effect would be different. Allocating the variances would spread the increase in cost across these accounts, rather than directly to cost of goods sold. This would result in a lower cost of goods sold for the period, which would increase net income.

Furthermore, since the variances are now allocated to work in process and finished goods, these accounts would have higher balances, which would increase the current assets portion of the current ratio. The current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities. An increase in current assets without a change in current liabilities would increase the current ratio.

Choices: a) Agree to recommend the appropriate accounting treatment after performing sufficient research on weather hedges.  b) Refuse to conduct the research and make a recommendation,  because of insufficient experience.  c) Refuse to conduct the research and make a recommendation,  because of a conflict of interest.  d) Agree with the accounting treatment recommended by the company’s hedge fund trader.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the IFAC Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants.  The code requires accountants to act with integrity,  objectivity,  and professional behavior.  It also states that accountants should maintain and improve their professional competence and conduct themselves in a manner that enhances the profession.
 Next,  I need to analyze each choice in the context of the code.  Choice a) suggests that the accountant can perform sufficient research to gain the necessary knowledge,  which aligns with the requirement to maintain and improve professional competence.
 Choice b) implies that the accountant should refuse to conduct research and make a recommendation due to insufficient experience,  which does not comply with the requirement to maintain and improve professional competence.

 Choice d) implies that the accountant should agree with the company’s hedge fund trader’s recommendation without conducting any research,  which goes against the requirement to act with objectivity and maintain professional competence.
 Therefore,  the correct action by the accountant in compliance with the IFAC Code of Ethics is to {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Rigg Steele and Urco Corps.  all accrual-basis calendar-year C corporations have only voting common stock outstanding.  Rigg owns 85  percent of Steele and 40  percent of Urco.  Steele owns 50  percent of Urco.  Which group of corporations qualifies as an affiliated group and may join in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return?  Choices: a) Rigg and Urco.  b) Urco and Steele.  c) Rigg Steele and Urco.  d) An affiliated group does not exist.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine if there is an affiliated group based on the ownership percentages.  An affiliated group is defined as a group of corporations that meet certain ownership and control tests.

Step 1: Identify the parent and subsidiary relationships.
- Rigg owns 85% of Steele, making Rigg the parent and Steele the subsidiary.
- Rigg owns 40% of Urco, making Rigg the parent and Urco the subsidiary.
- Steele owns 50% of Urco, making Steele the parent and Urco the subsidiary.

Step 2: Check if the ownership percentages meet the affiliated group criteria.
- For Rigg to qualify as a parent, it must own 80% or more of the stock of each subsidiary. Rigg owns 85% of Steele and 40% of Urco, so it does not meet this criterion for Urco.
- For Steele to qualify as a parent, it must own 80% or more of the stock of each subsidiary. Steele owns 50% of Urco, which does not meet this criterion.
- For Urco, there is no single parent that owns 80% or more of its stock.

Step 3: Determine if any subgroups qualify as affiliated groups.
- Rigg and Urco together do not form an affiliated group because Rigg does not own 80% or more of Urco.
- Rigg and Steele together form an affiliated group because Rigg owns 85% of Steele, which meets the criteria.
- Urco and Steele together do not form an affiliated group because Steele does not own 80% or more of Urco.

Based on the analysis, the only group that qualifies as an affiliated group is Rigg and Steele. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A CPA has been requested by a former audit client to reissue the auditor's report for the prior period.  Before reissuing the report,  the CPA should Choices: a) Obtain a letter of representation from the former client's management.  b) Make inquiries of the former client's attorney regarding pending litigation.  c) Review the former client's records to verify its compliance with debt and loan agreements.  d) Consider whether there is substantial doubt about the former client's ability to continue as a going concern.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the purpose of the request.  The former client has requested a reissued auditor's report for the prior period.  This suggests that the client wants to provide evidence of the financial health of the company to potential investors or creditors.
 Next,  I need to consider the ethical responsibilities of the CPA.  Before reissuing the report,  the CPA should ensure that there is no conflict of interest and that the information provided in the report is accurate and complete.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the options.  Option a) Obtain a letter of representation from the former client's management is a standard procedure to ensure that the CPA understands the scope of the engagement and the responsibilities of the client's management.
 Option b) Make inquiries of the former client's attorney regarding pending litigation is not directly related to the reissuance of the auditor's report, as it pertains to legal matters rather than financial reporting.
 Option c) Review the former client's records to verify its compliance with debt and loan agreements is relevant to the financial health of the company, but it is not a standard procedure for reissuing an auditor's report.
 Option d) Consider whether there is substantial doubt about the former client's ability to continue as a going concern is a relevant consideration, but it is typically assessed during the initial audit process, not when reissuing a report.

Based on these considerations, the most appropriate action for the CPA is to obtain a letter of representation from the former client's management (option a). Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A government entity is required to include a statement of cash flows in which of the following financial statements?  Choices: a) Governmental fund financial statements.  b) Government-wide financial statements.  c) Proprietary fund financial statements.  d) Fiduciary fund financial statements.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the purpose of each type of financial statement.  Governmental fund financial statements focus on the financial activities of government-owned funds.  Government-wide financial statements provide a comprehensive view of the government's financial position and results of operations.  Proprietary fund financial statements are used for business-type activities.  Fiduciary fund financial statements report on the financial activities of funds that manage assets for beneficiaries.
 Next,  I need to identify which financial statement is used to report cash flows.  The statement of cash flows shows the cash inflows and outflows of an entity during a specific period.  This statement is relevant to the overall financial health and performance of the entity.
 Finally,  I need to determine which financial statement includes the statement of cash flows.  The government-wide financial statements include the statement of cash flows, as they provide a comprehensive view of the government's financial position and results of operations.

"Input: In which of the following situations would there be inelastic demand?  Choices: a) A 5 % price increase results in a 3 % decrease in the quantity demanded.  b) A 4 % price increase results in a 6 % decrease in the quantity demanded.  c) A 4 % price increase results in a 4 % decrease in the quantity demanded.  d) A 3 % price decrease results in a 5 % increase in the quantity demanded.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what inelastic demand means.  Inelastic demand means that the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price.
 Next,  I will analyze each choice to see which one has inelastic demand.
 a) A 5 % price increase results in a 3 % decrease in the quantity demanded.  In this case,  the percentage change in quantity demanded (3 %) is less than the percentage change in price (5 %),  so this is inelastic demand.
 b) A 4 % price increase results in a 6 % decrease in the quantity demanded.  In this case,  the percentage change in quantity demanded (6 %) is greater than the percentage change in price (4 %),  so this is not inelastic demand.
 c) A 4 % price increase results in a 4 % decrease in the quantity demanded.  In this case,  the percentage change in quantity demanded (4 %) is equal to the percentage change in price (4 %),  so this is not inelastic demand.
 d) A 3 % price decrease results in a 5 % increase in the quantity demanded.  In this case,  the percentage change in quantity demanded (5 %) is greater than the percentage change in price (3 %),  so this is not inelastic demand.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Bay Co.  incurred legal fees in defending its patent rights.  These legal fees should be capitalized when the outcome of the litigation is Successful Unsuccessful Choices: a) Yes Yes b) Yes No c) No No d) No Yes 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the accounting principle for capitalizing costs.  Costs are capitalized when they are incurred to acquire,  develop, or maintain an asset.
 In this case,  the legal fees are incurred to defend patent rights,  which are intangible assets.  If the outcome of the litigation is successful,  the legal fees can be considered as an asset because they contribute to the maintenance of the patent rights.
 However,  if the outcome of the litigation is unsuccessful,  the legal fees cannot be capitalized as an asset because the patent rights are not acquired or maintained.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
