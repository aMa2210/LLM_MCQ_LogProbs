"Input: A 67 -year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination.  She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3  weeks.  She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued,  and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter.  She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2  weeks ago.  Today,  she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week.  Her only medication is warfarin.  Vital signs are within normal limits.  Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities.  Muscle strength is normal.  Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5  x 5 -cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh.  Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?  Choices: a) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization b) Complication of the IVC filter placement c) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve d) Hematoma of the left thigh 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and the presentation of the new symptom.  The patient had a pulmonary embolism,  a retroperitoneal hemorrhage,  and an IVC filter placement.  The sensation of tingling and numbness in the left thigh is a new symptom that the patient did not report before.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the possible causes of this symptom.  Option a) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization is less likely because it would cause more widespread neurological deficits and the patient's vital signs are within normal limits.  Option b) Complication of the IVC filter placement is also less likely because the symptoms are not consistent with an immediate complication of the filter placement.
 Option c) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is a plausible cause.  The IVC filter placement could compress the nerve,  leading to decreased sensation in the left thigh.  This is consistent with the patient's presentation of a localized area of decreased sensation on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh.
 Option d) Hematoma of the left thigh is less likely because the patient's hematoma was resolving on discharge from the hospital,  and the new symptom is not consistent with a hematoma that would have caused the sensation.

Therefore,  the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 25 -year-old gravida 3  para 2  female is admitted to the hospital at 39  weeks' gestation in active labor.  She had been having regular contractions every 4  minutes,  but is now having only a few intermittent,  weak contractions.  She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6  hours.  Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor.  The fetal head is engaged,  the membranes are intact,  the fetal heart tones are normal,  and the cervix is 100 % effaced and 7  cm dilated.  The most likely diagnosis is Choices: a) Braxton Hicks contractions b) lower uterine retraction ring c) hypotonic uterine dysfunction d) primary dysfunctional labor 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key information from the input.  The patient is 25 years old,  gravida 3  para 2 ,  admitted at 39  weeks' gestation,  in active labor,  regular contractions every 4  minutes,  but now intermittent and weak contractions,  received medication for pain twice in the past 6  hours,  examination shows no reason for obstructed labor,  fetal head engaged,  membranes intact,  fetal heart tones normal,  cervix 100 % effaced and 7  cm dilated.

Next,  I need to consider the possible diagnoses.  a) Braxton Hicks contractions are irregular and painless,  not related to labor progression.  b) Lower uterine retraction ring is a physical finding,  not a diagnosis.  c) Hypotonic uterine dysfunction refers to a lack of contractility,  which could explain the change in contractions.  d) Primary dysfunctional labor refers to labor without a clear cause,  but the patient has a clear physical examination and normal fetal parameters.

Based on the information provided,  the most likely diagnosis is c) hypotonic uterine dysfunction,  as the contractions have become weaker and there is a history of medication for pain,  which could contribute to a decrease in uterine contractility.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 5 -year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2 -day history of a low-grade fever,  cough,  and runny nose.  His temperature is 38 °C (100.4 °F).  Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold.  The physician refers to a randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold.  The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4  days,  compared with a mean time of 6.7  days for patients receiving the placebo (p=0.04 ).  Which of the following is the most appropriate interpretation of these study results?  Choices: a) The findings are clinically and statistically significant b) The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant c) The findings are clinically significant but statistically insignificant d) The findings are neither clinically nor statistically significant 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical relevance of the difference in mean symptom resolution times.  The new drug had a mean resolution time of 6.4  days,  while the placebo had a mean resolution time of 6.7  days.  The difference is only 0.3  days.
 Next,  I need to consider the statistical significance of the difference.  The p-value is 0.04,  which is less than the conventional threshold of 0.05 for statistical significance.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate interpretation of these study results is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 9 -year-old boy is brought to the office by his parents for a well-child examination.  The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2  months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4  years.  He has been generally healthy.  Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3  years.  He takes no medications.  He is at the 25 th percentile for height,  weight,  and BMI.  Vital signs are temperature 37.0 °C (98.6 °F),  pulse 82 /min,  respirations 20 /min,  and blood pressure 112 /74  mm Hg.  Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3 /6  systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces.  Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay.  Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence.  ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy.  This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?  Choices: a) Atrial fibrillation b) Cor pulmonale c) Systemic hypertension d) Tricuspid valve regurgitation 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the underlying cardiac condition.  The patient has a grade 3/6 systolic murmur along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces,  with a radiofemoral delay and left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG.  These findings are consistent with aortic stenosis.
 Next,  I need to determine the most common complications of aortic stenosis.  Atrial fibrillation can occur in patients with aortic stenosis,  but it is not the most common or immediate risk.  Cor pulmonale can develop due to decreased cardiac output and pulmonary congestion,  but it is less common than the other options.
 Systemic hypertension is a common complication of aortic stenosis,  due to increased afterload and decreased cardiac output.  Tricuspid valve regurgitation can also occur,  but it is less common and not the immediate risk in this patient.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 25 -year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2 -month history of numbness in her right hand.  During this period,  she has had tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time.  She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications.  She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home.  She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5  years until she stopped 2  years ago.  Vital signs are within normal limits.  Examination shows full muscle strength.  Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers.  Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger.  The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of which of the following on the right?  Choices: a) Median nerve at the wrist b) Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm c) Radial nerve at the forearm d) Ulnar nerve at the elbow 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the nerve that is most likely being entrapped based on the symptoms described.  The patient has numbness and tingling in the right ring and small fingers,  which are symptoms of Ulnar nerve entrapment.
 Next,  I need to determine where the Ulnar nerve is entrapped.  The examination shows severe pain when palpating the right elbow,  which indicates that the nerve is entrapped at the elbow.
 Therefore,  the most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of the Ulnar nerve at the elbow.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Six healthy subjects participate in a study of muscle metabolism during which hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia is induced.  Muscle biopsy specimens obtained from the subjects during the resting state show significantly increased concentrations of malonyl-CoA.  The increased malonyl-CoA concentration most likely directly inhibits which of the following processes in these subjects?  Choices: a) Fatty acid oxidation b) Fatty acid synthesis c) Gluconeogenesis d) Glycogenolysis 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the role of malonyl-CoA in metabolism.  Malonyl-CoA is a key intermediate in fatty acid synthesis and also acts as a negative regulator of this process.  It inhibits the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC),  which is the first step in fatty acid synthesis.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given and their relationship to malonyl-CoA.  a) Fatty acid oxidation is the opposite of fatty acid synthesis and is not directly inhibited by malonyl-CoA.  b) Fatty acid synthesis is directly inhibited by malonyl-CoA,  as mentioned earlier.  c) Gluconeogenesis is the process of generating glucose from non-carbohydrate sources and is not directly inhibited by malonyl-CoA.  d) Glycogenolysis is the breakdown of glycogen to glucose and is not directly inhibited by malonyl-CoA.

Her current medications include oxycodone,  hydrochlorothiazide,  and fluoxetine.  She has a normal BMI,  and her vital signs are within normal limits.  The firm,  distended abdomen with moderate tenderness over the liver is suggestive of liver involvement from the metastatic cancer.

The most appropriate next step in management would be to assess for suicidal ideation,  as the patient is displaying emotional distress and appears sad.  This is important to rule out any potential risk of suicide.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 65 -year-old woman has a 6 -month history of progressive irritability,  palpitations,  heat intolerance,  frequent bowel movements,  and a 6.8 -kg (15 -lb) weight loss.  She has had a neck mass for more than 10  years.  131 I scan shows an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple areas of increased and decreased uptake.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  Choices: a) Defect in thyroxine (T4 ) biosynthesis b) Graves' disease c) Multinodular goiter d) Riedel's thyroiditis 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation of the patient.  She is a 65 -year-old woman with symptoms of hyperthyroidism,  including irritability,  palpitations,  heat intolerance,  frequent bowel movements,  and weight loss.  Additionally,  she has an enlarged thyroid gland and a neck mass.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the imaging findings.  The 131 I scan shows an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple areas of increased and decreased uptake,  which is suggestive of multinodular goiter.
 Finally,  I need to consider the differential diagnosis.  The options are defect in thyroxine (T4 ) biosynthesis,  Graves' disease,  multinodular goiter,  and Riedel's thyroiditis.  A defect in T4 biosynthesis is unlikely in an elderly woman with these symptoms,  Graves' disease is typically associated with a single large goiter and diffuse enlargement,  Riedel's thyroiditis is a form of autoimmune thyroiditis and is less common in the elderly,  and multinodularBased on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is multinodular goiter. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 51 -year-old man comes to the office because of a 6 -month history of a lump on his tongue that is interfering with his speech and eating; he also has had a 6.8 -kg (15 -lb) weight loss during this period.  He has smoked 1  pack of cigarettes daily and has consumed six 12 -oz bottles of beer on weekend nights during the past 30  years.  His vital signs are within normal limits.  Physical examination shows a 1.5 -cm mass on the apex of the tongue.  Further evaluation of the mass confirms squamous cell carcinoma.  It is most appropriate to evaluate which of the following lymph nodes first for evidence of metastasis in this patient?  Choices: a) Inferior deep cervical b) Parotid c) Retropharyngeal d) Submental 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the location of the primary tumor.  The mass is located on the apex of the tongue,  which is in the oral cavity.
 Next,  we need to consider the lymphatic drainage pattern of the oral cavity.  The primary site of metastasis from the oral cavity is typically the inferior deep cervical nodes.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate lymph nodes to evaluate first for evidence of metastasis in this patient are the inferior deep cervical nodes.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 42 -year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination 1  week after he passed a renal calculus.  X-ray crystallographic analysis of the calculus showed calcium as the primary cation.  Physical examination today shows no abnormalities.  A 24 -hour collection of urine shows increased calcium excretion.  Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?  Choices: a) Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor b) Na+ –Cl− symport inhibitor c) Na+ –K + –2 Cl− symport inhibitor d) Osmotic diuretic 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the underlying condition causing the increased calcium excretion.  Since the calculus was composed primarily of calcium,  and the 24 -hour urine collection showed increased calcium excretion,  it is likely that the patient has hypercalcemia.
 Next,  I need to consider the pharmacotherapy options for treating hypercalcemia.  The most appropriate option is one that helps to reduce calcium reabsorption in the kidneys.
 Among the choices,  a) Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor is the most relevant option.  These drugs inhibit the enzyme carbonic anhydrase,  which is involved in the conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate.  By inhibiting this enzyme,  the drug indirectly reduces calcium reabsorption in the kidneys,  thus helping to lower calcium excretion.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: While you are on rounds at a local nursing facility,  the nurse mentions that your patient,  a 79 -year-old woman,  appears to be a ""poor eater. "" She was admitted to the nursing facility 3  months ago from the hospital where she was treated for congestive heart failure.  Her daughter had moved away from the area,  and nursing home placement was necessary because the patient could no longer function independently.  Her present medications include furosemide and digoxin.  Physical examination is normal except for a weight loss of 3.5  kg (7  lb) during the past 3  months.  In your conversation with the patient,  she says,  ""No,  I'm not depressed,  I just don't have an appetite anymore.  Nothing tastes good to me.  I have a little bit of nausea most of the time. "" Which of the following is the most appropriate initial diagnostic study?  Choices: a) Chest x-ray b) Complete blood count c) Determination of serum albumin concentration d) Determination of serum digoxin level 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the most likely cause of the patient's weight loss and decreased appetite.  The patient has a history of congestive heart failure and is currently taking furosemide and digoxin.  These medications can cause side effects such as nausea and decreased appetite.
 Next,  I need to determine which diagnostic test would be most helpful in confirming the presence of these side effects.  A determination of serum digoxin level would help to assess if the patient is experiencing digoxin-induced nausea and decreased appetite.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate initial diagnostic study is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A previously healthy 24 -year-old woman comes to the physician because of a low-grade fever and a nonproductive cough for 7  days.  She has been able to continue her daily activities.  Her temperature is 37.7 °C (99.9 °F).  A few scattered inspiratory crackles are heard in the thorax.  An x-ray of the chest shows patchy infiltrates in both lungs.  Which of the following is the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy?  Choices: a) Amoxicillin b) Cefaclor c) Ciprofloxacin d) Erythromycin 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the most likely diagnosis.  The patient presents with a low-grade fever,  nonproductive cough,  and patchy infiltrates in both lungs,  which are consistent with pneumonia.
 Next,  I need to consider the appropriate pharmacotherapy for pneumonia.  Pneumonia is typically caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae,  Haemophilus influenzae,  Moraxella catarrhalis,  or atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae.
 For Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae,  amoxicillin (a) is a suitable option.  For Moraxella catarrhalis,  cefaclor (b) can be used.  Ciprofloxacin (c) is an appropriate choice for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae.  Erythromycin (d) is not as effective against the common bacterial causes of pneumonia.

"Input: A 15 -year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents because of a 2 -hour history of confusion and agitation.  He also has had fever,  headache,  stiff neck,  and vomiting since he returned from summer camp 2  days ago.  His parents say he does not use illicit drugs.  On arrival,  he is combative and there is evidence of hallucinations.  His temperature is 40 °C (104 °F),  pulse is 80 /min,  respirations are 17 /min,  and blood pressure is 100 /70  mm Hg.  A lumbar puncture is performed.  Results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis show cysts and trophozoites.  The most likely portal of pathogen entry into this patient's central nervous system is which of the following?  Choices: a) Facial nerve b) Frontal sinus c) Mastoid sinus d) Olfactory nerve 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the pathogen causing the infection.  The presence of cysts and trophozoites in the cerebrospinal fluid suggests a protozoan infection.  Typical protozoan pathogens causing such symptoms include Toxoplasma gondii,  Cryptosporidium,  and Neospora.
 Next,  I need to consider the most common routes of infection for these pathogens.  Toxoplasma gondii is typically transmitted through ingestion of tissue cysts from contaminated food or water,  or contact with infected cat feces.  Cryptosporidium and Neospora are usually transmitted through ingestion of cysts in contaminated food or water.
 However,  the patient has a history of summer camp exposure,  which suggests a potential respiratory route of infection.  This leads me to consider the possibility of the pathogen entering through the nasal passages.
 Among the given choices,  the most likely port of entry for the pathogen into the central nervous system is the d) Olfactory nerve,  as it directly connects the nasal cavity to the brain.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 32 -year-old male presents to the office with the complaint of pain in his right shoulder for the past two weeks.

"Input: A 2 -year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his babysitter because of a 30 -minute history of respiratory distress.  The babysitter reports that she is 15  years old and has cared for the patient on numerous occasions during the past year.  The child's mother,  who is a single parent,  is currently out of town for business but will return later tonight.  The babysitter says,  ""He has had a runny nose since I started babysitting yesterday,  but this afternoon he awoke from a nap with a barking sound and he was breathing real heavy. "" She does not know the child's prior health history,  nor does she know if the boy takes any medications on a regular basis.  The child looks tired and sits upright on the babysitter's lap.  He is obviously comfortable with his caregiver.  Vital signs are temperature 38.7 °C (101.7 °F),  pulse 110 /min,  respirations 28 /min and labored,  and blood pressure 85 /50  mm Hg.  Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 89 %.  Physical examination discloses inspiratory stridor.  Neck is supple,  tympanic membranes are normal,  and there is a profuse nasal discharge.  Examination of the pharynx discloses no abnormalities.  Auscultation of the chest discloses equal air entry on both sides and no crackles.  The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.  Treatment with 40 % oxygen via venturi mask and intravenous fluids is initiated.  Despite continued supplemental oxygen and hydration,  the child remains tachypneic and stridorous at rest.  Oxygen saturation is now 93 %.  In addition to administering racemic epinephrine by nebulizer,  which of the following is the most appropriate next step?  Choices: a) Intravenous aminophylline therapy b) Intravenous antibiotic therapy c) Intubation d) Oral dexamethasone therapy 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation.  The child is experiencing respiratory distress,  with fever,  labored breathing,  and stridor.  Inspiratory stridor and a profuse nasal discharge suggest an upper airway issue.  The absence of crackles on chest auscultation and normal tympanic membranes suggest that the problem is not due to pneumonia.  The most likely diagnosis is croup,  a viral infection of the upper airway that causes swelling and narrowing of the airway,  resulting in stridor and respiratory distress.
 Next,  I need to consider the appropriate treatment for croup.  Initial treatment includes supportive care,  such as oxygen via a venturi mask and intravenous fluids.  The child's response to these treatments is not optimal,  so further intervention is necessary.
 Finally,  I need to evaluate the options for further intervention.  Racemic epinephrine by nebulizer is a common treatment for croup,  and it can help to reduce airway swelling and improve breathing.  Intravenous aminophylline therapy is used for treating asthma and other conditions,  but it is not typically used for croup.  Intravenous antibiotic therapy is not indicated for viral infections like croup.  Oral dexamethasone therapy can be used for severe croup,  but it is not the first-line treatment.  The most appropriate next step is c) Intubation,  as it is the definitive treatment for severe croup that does not respond to initial supportive care and medications.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 16 -year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3 -day history of abdominal pain and vomiting; he also has had decreased appetite during this period.  The pain was initially on the right but now has become generalized.  His temperature is 38.8 °C (101.8 °F),  pulse is 100 /min,  respirations are 20 /min,  and blood pressure is 143 /83  mm Hg.  Abdominal examination shows guarding with diffuse rebound tenderness.  There are no palpable masses.  A CT scan of the abdomen shows a perforated appendix.  Examination of peritoneal fluid from this patient will most likely show which of the following organisms?  Choices: a) Candida albicans b) Citrobacter freundii c) Escherichia coli d) Staphylococcus aureus 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the most common cause of perforated appendicitis.  The most common cause is the infection of the appendix,  which is usually caused by bacteria.
 Next,  I need to consider the types of bacteria that are most commonly found in appendicitis.  The most common bacteria found in appendicitis are Enterobacteriaceae,  which include Escherichia coli,  Citrobacter freundii,  and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
 Finally,  I need to consider the options given.  The most likely organisms to be found in peritoneal fluid from a patient with a perforated appendix are Escherichia coli (option c) and Citrobacter freundii (option b),  as they are both Enterobacteriaceae.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 52 -year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 1 -week history of low-grade fever and increasing abdominal cramps that are exacerbated by bowel movements.

"Input: A 42 -year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1 -year history of vaginal bleeding for 2  to 5  days every 2  weeks.  The flow varies from light to heavy with passage of clots.  Menses previously occurred at regular 25 - to 29 -day intervals and lasted for 5  days with normal flow.  She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications.  She is sexually active with one male partner,  and they use condoms inconsistently.  Her mother died of colon cancer,  and her maternal grandmother died of breast cancer.  She is 163  cm (5  ft 4  in) tall and weighs 77  kg (170  lb); BMI is 29  kg/m2  .  Her temperature is 36.6 °C (97.8 °F),  pulse is 90 /min,  respirations are 12 /min,  and blood pressure is 100 /60  mm Hg.  The uterus is normal sized.  The ovaries cannot be palpated.  The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.  Test of the stool for occult blood is negative.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?  Choices: a) Progesterone challenge test b) Colposcopy c) Cystoscopy d) Endometrial biopsy 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the cause of the abnormal vaginal bleeding.  The patient has a history of irregular bleeding with heavy flow and clots,  and her menstrual history has changed.  She also has a family history of cancer.
 Next,  I need to rule out any potential causes of the bleeding.  The stool occult blood test is negative,  so cancer is less likely.
 Considering the symptoms and history,  the most likely cause is endometrial abnormalities.  The most appropriate next step in diagnosis is to perform an endometrial biopsy.

"Input: A 13 -year-old girl is brought to the office for a health maintenance visit.  She was diagnosed with Turner syndrome in infancy during a work-up for coarctation of the aorta.  During today's visit,  her mother reports that the girl has been talking about babies.  You have been the patient's physician for the past 6  years and know she is prepubescent.  It is most appropriate to counsel the patient that if she wishes to have a family she will need to do which of the following?  Choices: a) Adopt b) Have amniocentesis if she gets pregnant c) Have an operation d) Receive genetic counseling 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the patient's condition.  She is prepubescent and has Turner syndrome,  which means she is not able to conceive naturally.
 Next,  I need to consider the options available to her.  The choices are to adopt,  have amniocentesis,  have an operation,  or receive genetic counseling.
 Since the patient cannot conceive naturally,  adoption is a viable option.  Amniocentesis is not relevant to her situation,  and there is no mention of needing an operation.  Genetic counseling is important,  but it does not address her ability to have a family.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate counsel for the patient is to adopt.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 77 -year-old man is brought to the physician because of a 12 -hour history of word-finding difficulty and weakness and sensory loss of the right arm and leg.  He has no history of similar symptoms.  He has type 2  diabetes mellitus,  hypertension,  and atrial fibrillation.  Current medications include metformin,  lisinopril,  and aspirin.  He is alert.  His pulse is 80 /min and irregular,  respirations are 16 /min,  and blood pressure is 170 /90  mm Hg.  He follows commands but has nonfluent aphasia.  There is moderate weakness and decreased sensation of the right upper and lower extremities.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2 + bilaterally.  Babinski sign is present on the right.  His serum glucose concentration is 162  mg/dL.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?  Choices: a) Carotid duplex ultrasonography b) CT scan of the head c) EEG d) Lumbar puncture 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation and the patient's history.  The patient has a sudden onset of symptoms,  including word-finding difficulty,  weakness,  and sensory loss in the right arm and leg.  These symptoms suggest a possible cerebrovascular event,  such as a stroke.
 Next,  I need to consider the diagnostic options.  Carotid duplex ultrasonography is a noninvasive test that can detect carotid artery stenosis,  which is a risk factor for stroke.  CT scan of the head is a common imaging test for diagnosing acute stroke.  EEG is used to diagnose epilepsy,  not acute stroke.  Lumbar puncture is used to diagnose and treat certain central nervous system conditions,  but it is not typically used for diagnosing acute stroke.
 Given the patient's presentation and the diagnostic options,  the most appropriate next step in diagnosis is to perform a CT scan of the head.  This test can quickly identify the presence of a hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke and guide further management.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 16 -year-old high school student,  whose prenatal course you have managed,  delivers a 3256 -g (7 -lb 3 -oz) baby girl during the night with the assistance of your associate.  On morning rounds you note that the delivery records report that she had mildly elevated blood pressure during labor and sustained an estimated third-stage blood loss of 500  mL.  Today blood pressure is 132 /84  mm Hg,  she is afebrile,  and deep tendon reflexes are normal.  The uterine fundus is firm and at the level of the umbilicus,  and her perineum is slightly edematous.  Hematocrit is 33 %.  She is cuddling her infant and normal bonding seems to be occurring.  Which of the following is the most important next step in management?  Choices: a) Begin oral methyldopa b) Institute fundal massage c) Order daily sitz baths d) Provide education for well-baby care 
 Output:
 First,  I need to assess the patient's current condition and identify any immediate concerns.  The patient has mild hypertension,  a small third-stage blood loss,  and a slightly elevated blood pressure today.  Her reflexes are normal,  she is afebrile,  and normal bonding is occurring.  However,  the uterine fundus is at the level of the umbilicus,  indicating possible postpartum hemorrhage.

The most important next step in management is to address the firm and elevated uterus.  This can be done through fundal massage to help reduce the size of the uterus and prevent postpartum hemorrhage.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A previously healthy 17 -year-old girl comes to the physician because of a 2 -month history of exercise-induced cough and nasal congestion.  She plays field hockey and has noticed she coughs when running up and down the field.  The cough is nonproductive and resolves with rest.  She has not had chest pain or palpitations.  She takes no medications and does not smoke.  Her sister has asthma.  The patient appears well.  Her pulse is 68 /min,  respirations are 16 /min,  and blood pressure is 100 /75  mm Hg.  Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 99 %.  Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities.  An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities.  Spirometry shows an FEV1 :FVC ratio of 90 % and an FEV1  of 90 % of predicted.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  Choices: a) Asthma b) Chronic bronchitis c) Gastroesophageal reflux disease d) Postnasal drip syndrome 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and history of the patient.  She has a 2 -month history of exercise-induced cough and nasal congestion,  which resolves with rest.  She has a family history of asthma.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the physical examination and tests.  Her pulse,  respirations,  and blood pressure are normal.  Her oxygen saturation is 99 % on room air,  indicating no respiratory distress.  The chest x-ray shows no abnormalities.  Spirometry shows an FEV1 :FVC ratio of 90 %,  which is normal,  and an FEV1  of 90 % of predicted,  which is also normal.
 Based on these findings,  the patient does not have asthma (a),  chronic bronchitis (b),  or gastroesophageal reflux disease (c),  as these conditions would be indicated by abnormalities in spirometry or other findings.  Postnasal drip syndrome (d) is a likely diagnosis,  as it can cause exercise-induced cough and nasal congestion,  and the patient's physical examination and tests are consistent with this diagnosis.
 Therefore,  the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 24 -year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination.  One week ago,  she was treated in the emergency department after she accidentally spilled hot grease on her left leg while working at a fast-food restaurant.  Examination of the left lower extremity shows a 7 -cm,  pink,  soft,  granular,  edematous wound.  The formation of this tissue was most likely caused by increased activity of which of the following?  Choices: a) Glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1  b) P-selectin c) Stromelysin d) Vascular endothelial growth factor 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the clinical scenario.  The patient accidentally spilled hot grease on her left leg,  causing a burn.  The wound is 7 -cm in size,  pink,  soft,  granular,  and edematous.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices provided and their roles in wound healing.  Glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1 (a) is involved in cell adhesion,  but it is not directly related to wound formation.  P-selectin (b) is involved in the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells,  but it is not directly related to wound formation.  Stromelysin (c) is a matrix metalloproteinase that degrades extracellular matrix components,  which is involved in wound formation.  Vascular endothelial growth factor (d) is involved in angiogenesis,  but it is not directly related to wound formation.
 The formation of granular,  soft,  edematous tissue in the wound is most likely caused by the degradation of extracellular matrix components.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 23 -year-old woman comes to the physician for genetic counseling prior to conception.  Her brother and maternal uncle had Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and died at the ages of 28  and 17  years,  respectively.  Genetic analysis was not performed on either relative prior to death.  Serum studies show a muscle creatine kinase concentration of 120  U/L (N=22 – 198 ).  The patient's 50 -year-old mother has a serum muscle creatine kinase concentration of 300  U/L.  Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of this patient's carrier status for this disease?  Choices: a) The patient has a 50 % risk of having a child with DMD b) The patient is a carrier of the disease based on her family history of DMD c) The patient is not a carrier of the DMD based on her normal creatine kinase concentration d) The patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain because of random X inactivation 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the family history of DMD.  The patient has a brother and maternal uncle with DMD,  and her mother has a higher muscle creatine kinase concentration than normal,  which is suggestive of a muscle disorder.
 Next,  I need to consider the mode of inheritance of DMD.  DMD is an X-linked recessive disorder,  meaning that the gene responsible for the disorder is located on the X chromosome.  Females have two X chromosomes,  while males have one X and one Y chromosome.  A female must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to have the disease,  while a male only needs to inherit one copy from his mother to have the disease.
 Now,  I need to assess the patient's carrier status.  Based on her family history,  it is likely that she is a carrier of the DMD gene,  as her mother likely passed on the mutated gene to her brother and maternal uncle.  However,  the patient's serum muscle creatine kinase concentration is within the normal range,  which does not necessarily rule out carrier status.
 Finally,  I need to consider the impact of random X inactivation.  Random X inactivation is a process where one of the two X chromosomes in a female is randomly inactivated,  depending on cellular lineages.  This can lead to variable expression of X-linked genes,  including DMD.  However,  this does not change the fact that the patient is likely a carrier based on her family history.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate assessment of the patient's carrier status for DMD is that she is a carrier of the disease based on her family history of DMD.  So,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 3 -year-old white girl is brought to the office by her parents for a follow-up visit 48  hours after receiving a 5 -TU PPD skin test.  The test was done as part of a routine screening for enrollment in a homeless shelter.  Physical examination shows 10  mm of induration at the puncture site; the examination is otherwise normal.  The parents tell you they are shocked by this finding since both of their skin tests were nonreactive.  They say they were born in this country and tell you that their daughter has always been in good health.  She has not had much medical care in the past 2  years but she has been healthy.  Until moving into this shelter they had been ""squatters"" in vacant buildings.  Which of the following is the most appropriate step at this time?  Choices: a) Call her previous physician to obtain more history b) Order a chest x-ray c) Order a test for HIV antibody d) Repeat the PPD skin test 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical context and the patient's history.  The girl has a positive PPD skin test result,  indicating possible exposure to tuberculosis.  Her parents are concerned because they have negative PPD skin test results and their daughter has been healthy.  The family has recently moved into a homeless shelter,  which is a high-risk environment for infectious diseases.  The parents mention that they have been ""squatters"" in vacant buildings,  which may expose the child to environmental risks.

Second,  I need to evaluate the diagnostic options.  a) Calling the previous physician may provide additional information about the child's medical history and exposure to potential infectious agents.  b) A chest x-ray can help diagnose tuberculosis by showing signs of lung involvement.  c) A test for HIV antibody is relevant if there is concern about HIV infection,  but it is not directly related to the PPD skin test result.  d) Repeating the PPD skin test can confirm the result or show a possible false-positive result due to local exposure.

Third,  I need to consider the priority and relevance of each option.  Given the context of the shelter and the recent history of ""squatting,""  it is important to investigate potential exposure to tuberculosis.  A chest x-ray is the most direct way to diagnose tuberculosis,  and it is relevant to the positive PPD skin test result.  Calling the previous physician can provide additional information,  but it is not as urgent as diagnosing tuberculosis.  Testing for HIV antibody is not directly related to the current situation.  Repeating the PPD skin test can be done,  but it may not provide additional information if the chest x-ray shows lung involvement.

Therefore,  the most appropriate step at this time is to order a chest x-ray (b).

The answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 65 -year-old female is admitted to the hospital after experiencing aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis.  She subsequently develops urinary incontinence.  There is no evidence of urinary tract infection and no prior history of urinary pathology.  The most likely diagnosis is Choices: a) autonomic neurogenic bladderv b) motor paralytic bladder c) reflex neurogenic bladder d) uninhibited neurogenic bladder 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms presented.  Aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis suggest a stroke or similar neurological event.  Urinary incontinence is a common symptom following such events.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the possible diagnoses based on the symptoms.  Autonomic neurogenic bladder is caused by damage to the autonomic nervous system, leading to a loss of bladder control.  Motor paralytic bladder is caused by damage to the motor neurons, leading to a loss of bladder muscle function.  Reflex neurogenic bladder is caused by damage to the reflex pathways, leading to a loss of bladder reflexes.  Uninhibited neurogenic bladder is caused by a loss of inhibitory signals, leading to involuntary bladder contractions.
 Given the symptoms of aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis, the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 35 -year-old woman comes to the office because of a 3 -day history of severe right back pain.  She has not had any fever,  chills,  or weight loss.  She has no history of major medical illness.  Musculoskeletal and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities.  When told that her examination is normal,  the patient becomes tearful and demands an MRI of her back because her mother just died from breast cancer metastatic to bone and she fears that she may also have cancer.  The patient already contacted her insurance company,  who told her that if she has neurologic abnormalities an MRI may be covered by her plan.  The patient asks the physician to order the MRI indicating that she has neurologic findings.  Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the physician?  Choices: a) Advise the patient to change insurance companies as soon as she is able so that she can receive more comprehensive medical care b) Explain that the patient does not need the MRI and that it is not appropriate to misrepresent her examination findings c) Immediately inform the patient's insurance company about what the patient has asked the physician to do d) Order the MRI as the patient requests 
 Output:
 First,  the physician needs to assess the patient's symptoms and medical history to determine if there is a medical indication for an MRI.  The patient has severe right back pain for 3 days,  but no fever,  chills,  or weight loss,  and no history of major medical illness.  Musculoskeletal and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities.  Based on this information,  an MRI is not indicated for back pain without neurological abnormalities.
 Next,  the physician needs to address the patient's anxiety about her mother's cancer.  The patient's fear of having cancer is understandable,  but there is no current evidence to suggest that she has cancer.  The physician should provide reassurance and discuss the risks and benefits of the MRI.
 Finally,  the physician needs to consider the appropriateness of the patient's request.  The patient is misrepresenting her examination findings to obtain the MRI,  which is unethical.  The physician should explain to the patient that the MRI is not appropriate and that misrepresenting her examination findings is unethical.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate initial action by the physician is to explain to the patient that the patient does not need the MRI and that it is not appropriate to misrepresent her examination findings,  which corresponds to option b).

"Input: A 32 -year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30  minutes after being struck by a car while driving his motorcycle.  He reports severe pelvic pain.  On examination,  there is bruising of the perineum and pain is elicited with motion of his pelvis.  Blood is noted at the urethral meatus.  There is no other penile trauma.  A plain x-ray shows a fracture of the superior pubic ramus and retrograde urethrography is done to evaluate for a urethral disruption.  Which of the following portions of the urethra would be at greatest risk for injury in this patient?  Choices: a) Intramural (pre-prostatic) b) Membranous c) Prostatic d) Spongy 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the anatomy of the urethra and the areas that are most susceptible to injury.  The urethra is divided into four sections: the bulbourethral, membranous, prostatic, and spongy.  The membranous portion is the most mobile and is located where the urethra passes through the pubic symphysis.  This area is particularly vulnerable to trauma due to its mobility and the forces involved in pelvic fractures.

Next,  I need to consider the patient's presentation.  The patient was struck by a car while riding a motorcycle,  resulting in severe pelvic pain and bruising of the perineum.  The pain is elicited with motion of the pelvis,  and blood is noted at the urethral meatus.  These findings suggest a pelvic fracture,  which can lead to urethral disruption.

Given the patient's presentation and the anatomy of the urethra,  the portion of the urethra at greatest risk for injury is the membranous section (b).

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 33 -year-old female presents to the office with the complaint of chronic pelvic pain that began after she underwent a hysterectomy 6  months ago.  Following a physical examination,  a CT scan of the pelvis is ordered.  After the scan is complete,  the radiologist calls to report that the patient has a surgical sponge in her pelvis.  In a subsequent malpractice suit,  the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence.  The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is Choices: a) collateral estoppel b) proximate cause c) res ipsa loquitur d) respondeat superior 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the legal concepts involved.  Collateral estoppel is a principle that prevents relitigation of the same issue in a subsequent legal proceeding.  Proximate cause is a legal concept that requires a direct causal link between the defendant's actions and the plaintiff's injury.  Res ipsa loquitur is a legal principle that allows a plaintiff to infer negligence without direct evidence, based on the nature of the injury and the circumstances surrounding it.  Respondeat superior is a principle that holds an employer liable for the wrongful acts of an employee committed within the scope of their employment.

Next,  I need to analyze the situation presented.  The patient is suing for negligence,  and the evidence presented is that the surgical sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence.  This implies that the nature of the injury (a surgical sponge left in the patient's pelvis) and the circumstances (a hysterectomy 6 months ago) strongly suggest negligence.

Finally,  I need to match the legal concept to the situation.  In this case,  the most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is res ipsa loquitur,  as it allows the patient to infer negligence without direct evidence, based on the nature of the injury and the circumstances surrounding it.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 35 -year-old man comes to the office for follow-up of sarcoidosis.  His only new complaint is pain in his legs that increases with weight-bearing.  He has been taking glucocorticoid therapy for the past 6  months.  Vital signs now are temperature 37.0 °C (98.6 °F),  pulse 78 /min,  respirations 14 /min,  and blood pressure 110 /70  mm Hg.  The patient is thin and is in no acute distress.  Auscultation of the chest discloses scattered bilateral basilar crackles.  There is mild left hip pain present with both active and passive range of motion.  Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact.  Neurologic examination is normal.  Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?  Choices: a) Avascular necrosis of the femoral head b) Herniated nucleus pulposus c) Narrowing of the hip joint d) Osteoporosis 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's age and the fact that he has sarcoidosis,  which can cause joint involvement.  The pain in his legs that increases with weight-bearing and the presence of basilar crackles on auscultation of the chest suggest involvement of the joints.
 Next,  I need to consider the patient's treatment history,  which includes glucocorticoid therapy,  which can cause osteoporosis.  The mild left hip pain with both active and passive range of motion limitations is consistent with joint involvement.
 Finally,  I need to compare the choices given:
 a) Avascular necrosis of the femoral head is a possible cause,  but it is less likely because the patient has been on glucocorticoid therapy,  which can cause bone loss and osteoporosis.
 b) Herniated nucleus pulposus is not a likely cause,  as it typically affects the lumbar spine and does not cause joint pain in the legs.
 c) Narrowing of the hip joint is a likely cause,  as it can cause pain in the legs that increases with weight-bearing and is consistent with joint involvement in sarcoidosis.
 d) Osteoporosis is a possible cause,  but it is less likely than narrowing of the hip joint,  as the patient has been on glucocorticoid therapy,  which can cause bone loss and osteoporosis,  but it does not specifically cause joint pain in the legs.

Based on the information provided,  the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is narrowing of the hip joint (c).  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 67 -year-old man with Parkinson disease is admitted to the hospital for treatment of pneumonia.  The patient's daughter,  who is visiting the patient,  says he has had increased lethargy for the past day and decreased ambulation during the past 6  months.  She also says that there are times during the day when his tremors increase in severity,  although he continues to care for himself at home.  Medical history is also remarkable for hypertension.  Medications include hydrochlorothiazide,  atenolol,  levodopa,  and carbidopa.  He is 168  cm (5  ft 6  in) tall and weighs 78  kg (172  lb); BMI is 28  kg/m2  .  Vital signs are temperature 38.9 °C (102.0 °F),  pulse 60 /min supine and 68 /min standing,  respirations 22 /min,  and blood pressure 100 /60  mm Hg supine and 80 /50  mm Hg standing.  The patient appears ill and older than his stated age.  He is fully oriented but lethargic.  Auscultation of the chest discloses rhonchi in the right mid lung field.  Abdominal examination discloses no abnormalities.  Neurologic examination discloses masked facies,  bradykinesia,  and cogwheel rigidity; gait was not assessed on admission.  Chest x-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate.  ECG shows no abnormalities.  Appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy is initiated.  Prior to discharge,  which of the following is the most appropriate step?  Choices: a) Obtain CT scan of the chest b) Obtain a swallowing evaluation c) Place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube d) Prescribe fludrocortisone 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the most appropriate step to take before the patient is discharged.  The patient has pneumonia,  and appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy has been initiated.  The chest x-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate,  which is consistent with pneumonia.  The patient also has Parkinson disease,  hypertension,  and is taking medications for these conditions.

Next,  I need to consider the choices provided.  Choice a) Obtain CT scan of the chest is not the most appropriate step at this point,  since the chest x-ray already shows a right lower lobe infiltrate.  Choice b) Obtain a swallowing evaluation is not the most appropriate step,  since there is no indication of difficulty swallowing or risk of aspiration.  Choice c) Place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is not the most appropriate step,  since the patient is able to care for himself at home and there is no indication of difficulty eating or drinking.  Choice d) Prescribe fludrocortisone is not the most appropriate step,  since the patient does not have hypothyroidism or other conditions that would require fludrocortisone.

Therefore,  the most appropriate step is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 64 -year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 5 -month history of increasing shortness of breath,  sore throat,  and a cough productive of a small amount of white phlegm.  Over the past week,  she has had nausea related to excess coughing.  Over the past year,  she has had a 3.2 -kg (7 -lb) weight loss.  She has asthma treated with theophylline and inhaled β-adrenergic agonists and corticosteroids.  She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 44  years and drinks one alcoholic beverage daily.  She appears thin.  Examination shows a 2 -cm,  nontender lymph node in the right supraclavicular area.  Examination shows no other abnormalities.  An x-ray of the chest shows a large right lower lobe density.  A CT scan of the chest shows a 7.5  x 7.5  x 6 -cm right lower lobe mass with some scattered calcifications.  The lesion abuts the posterior chest wall without clear invasion.  There are right lower peritracheal,  precarinal,  right hilar,  and subcarinal lymph nodes.  There is a 1.5 -cm mass in the right adrenal gland.  A biopsy specimen of the lung mass is most likely to show which of the following?  Choices: a) Mesothelioma b) Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast c) Multiple endocrine neoplasia d) Non-small cell lung carcinoma 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and physical examination.  She has a long history of smoking,  a weight loss of 3.2  kg over the past year,  and a large mass in the right lower lobe of the lung with some calcifications.  The presence of lymph node involvement and a mass in the adrenal gland also suggests malignancy.  The symptoms and findings are consistent with lung cancer.
 Next,  I need to consider the imaging findings.  The CT scan shows a large mass in the right lower lobe with lymph node involvement and a separate mass in the adrenal gland.  This is consistent with a metastatic process.
 Finally,  I need to consider the choices provided.  Mesothelioma is typically associated with asbestos exposure and is less common in smokers.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast is less likely given the age and smoking history.  Multiple endocrine neoplasia is a rare condition and is not typically associated with a large lung mass.  Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer and is associated with smoking.

The patient had mammography and ultrasonography of the breasts 2  months ago for evaluation of increased glandularity,  palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast,  noted at her most recent annual examination.  The studies showed likely benign findings with recommended follow-up in 6  months.  Medical history is otherwise unremarkable and she takes no medications.  BMI is 30  kg/m2  .  Vital signs are normal.  Palpation of the right breast discloses glandularity in the upper outer quadrant but no other masses.  There is scant,  black discharge from the right nipple.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?  Choices: a) Ductography b) Excisional biopsy of glandular tissue c) Repeat mammography d) Repeat ultrasonography of the right breast 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the history and physical findings.  The patient has a 2 -week history of black discharge from her right nipple,  which is a concerning symptom.  The previous imaging studies showed likely benign findings but recommended follow-up.  The patient has a BMI of 30 kg/m2,  which is overweight,  and there is glandularity in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast.  The discharge is scant and black,  which could be due to Paget's disease of the breast.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the options for further evaluation.  Ductography is a specialized imaging technique that can visualize the milk ducts and can help in the diagnosis of Paget's disease.  Excisional biopsy of glandular tissue can definitively diagnose Paget's disease and other breast pathologies.  Repeat mammography and ultrasonography may not be as helpful in diagnosing Paget's disease as the previous studies were likely already performed to a high standard.

"Input: A 37 -year-old woman with AIDS comes to the physician because of a 1 -month history of progressive diarrhea and a 1.8 - kg (4 -lb) weight loss.  During the past week,  she has had six large watery stools daily.  She is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy.  She is employed as a flight attendant and works regularly on domestic flights throughout the USA.  She also flies to Asia at least once monthly.  She is 163  cm (5  ft 4  in) tall and weighs 59  kg (130  lb); BMI is 22  kg/m2  .  Her temperature is 37 °C (98.6 °F),  pulse is 88 /min,  and blood pressure is 112 /64  mm Hg.  The abdomen is scaphoid.  The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.  Her CD4 + T-lymphocyte count is 400 /mm3  (Normal≥500 ).  Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?  Choices: a) Cryptosporidium parvum b) Cytomegalovirus c) Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex d) Salmonella enteritidis 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and symptoms.  The patient has AIDS,  which makes her more susceptible to opportunistic infections.  She has a 1-month history of progressive diarrhea and a 1.8-kg (4-lb) weight loss.  These symptoms are common in patients with AIDS.
 Next,  I need to consider the mode of transmission.  The patient works as a flight attendant and travels frequently,  which increases the risk of exposure to various pathogens.  She has flown to Asia at least once monthly,  which may have exposed her to different pathogens.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  a) Cryptosporidium parvum is a common cause of watery diarrhea in immunocompromised patients,  but it is usually transmitted through contaminated water.  b) Cytomegalovirus is a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS,  but it usually causes respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms.  c) Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex is a rare cause of diarrhea in AIDS patients,  and it usually presents with more severe symptoms.  d) Salmonella enteritidis is a common cause of acute gastroenteritis,  but it is not typically associated with AIDS.
 Based on the patient's history and symptoms,  as well as the mode of transmission,  the most likely causal organism is a) Cryptosporidium parvum.

"Input: A healthy 22 -year-old man participates in a study of glucose metabolism.  At the beginning of the study,  his serum glucose concentration is within the reference range.  He consumes an 800 -calorie meal consisting of protein,  fat,  and carbohydrates.  He then sleeps through the night without additional food or drink.  Twelve hours later,  his serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range.  Which of the following mechanisms is most likely involved in maintaining this man's serum glucose concentration?  Choices: a) Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal b) Glucose release from skeletal muscle c) Glycogenolysis in the liver d) Increased leptin release from adipose tissues 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the scenario.  The man starts with a normal glucose concentration,  consumes an 800 -calorie meal,  and then goes 12  hours without eating.  His glucose concentration remains normal.
 Next,  I can eliminate options a) and d).  Continued gut absorption would lead to a higher glucose concentration,  and increased leptin release would not directly affect serum glucose concentration.
 Now,  I need to consider options b) and c).  Glucose release from skeletal muscle (b) could help maintain normal glucose concentration,  but it is not the primary mechanism for maintaining glucose within the reference range.  Glycogenolysis in the liver (c) is the primary mechanism,  as it can quickly release glucose into the bloodstream to maintain normal glucose levels.
 Therefore,  the most likely mechanism involved in maintaining this man's serum glucose concentration is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A previously healthy 22 -year-old college student is brought to the emergency department by her parents 20  minutes after they observed her having a seizure.  After the seizure,  she was confused and had difficulty thinking of some words.  She has had a headache,  cough,  and fever for 3  days treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan.  Her temperature is 38.9 °C (102 °F).  Neurologic examination shows diffuse hyperreflexia.  On mental status examination,  she is confused and has short-term memory deficits.  She has difficulty naming objects and makes literal paraphasic errors.  An MRI of the brain shows bitemporal hyperintensities.  A lumbar puncture is done; cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows an erythrocyte count of 340 /mm3  ,  a leukocyte count of 121 /mm3  (88 % monocytes),  and a protein concentration of 78  mg/dL.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  Choices: a) Bacterial meningitis b) Dextromethorphan intoxication c) Herpes simplex encephalitis d) HIV encephalopathy 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's symptoms and the results of the MRI and cerebrospinal fluid analysis.  The patient has a history of fever,  cough,  and headache for 3  days,  followed by a seizure,  confusion,  difficulty thinking of some words,  and diffuse hyperreflexia on neurologic examination.  The MRI shows bitemporal hyperintensities,  and the cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows an elevated erythrocyte count,  leukocyte count with a predominance of monocytes,  and a high protein concentration.

Second,  I need to evaluate the diagnostic options.  Option a) Bacterial meningitis is less likely because the leukocyte count is not extremely high,  and the predominance of monocytes is more consistent with viral or fungal infections.  Option b) Dextromethorphan intoxication does not fit the clinical picture,  as the patient was treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan for a cough and fever,  and the symptoms do not align with dextromethorphan intoxication.  Option c) Herpes simplex encephalitis has a good fit with the clinical presentation and cerebrospinal fluid findings,  including the bitemporal hyperintensities on MRI and the elevated leukocyte count with a predominance of monocytes.  Option d) HIV encephalopathy is less likely because the patient is a previously healthy 22 -year-old college student,  and the clinical presentation and cerebrospinal fluid findings do not strongly suggest HIV infection.

"Input: A 40 -year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6 -month history of increased facial hair growth.  Her last menstrual period was 4  months ago.  She is 165  cm (5  ft 5  in) tall and weighs 70  kg (154  lb); BMI is 26  kg/m2  .  Her pulse is 80 /min,  and blood pressure is 130 /82  mm Hg.  Physical examination shows temporal balding and coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin.  Pelvic examination shows clitoral enlargement.  Her serum testosterone concentration is increased.  Serum concentrations of androstenedione,  dehydroepiandrosterone,  and urinary 17 -ketosteroids are within the reference ranges.  Ultrasonography of the pelvis shows a 12 -cm ovarian mass.  Which of the following best describes this mass?  Choices: a) Granulosa tumor b) Ovarian carcinoid c) Sertoli-Leydig tumor d) Teratoma 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the clinical presentation and laboratory findings that suggest the presence of an endocrine tumor.  The patient has hirsutism, anovulatory bleeding, and a BMI within the overweight range,  along with elevated serum testosterone levels and a 12 -cm ovarian mass.
 Next,  I need to consider the differential diagnosis of an ovarian endocrine tumor.  The options are granulosa tumors,  Sertoli-Leydig tumors,  ovarian carcinoids,  and teratomas.
 Finally,  I need to use the specific characteristics of each tumor to identify the most likely diagnosis.  Granulosa tumors are associated with elevated androstenedione levels,  Sertoli-Leydig tumors are associated with elevated testosterone levels,  ovarian carcinoids are associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and elevated dehydroepiandrosterone levels,  and teratomas are associated with multiple tissue types and are usually benign.
 In this case,  the patient has elevated serum testosterone levels and a 12 -cm ovarian mass,  which is consistent with a Sertoli-Leydig tumor.  The other options do not fit the clinical presentation and laboratory findings as well.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 77 -year-old female presents to the office for evaluation of a syncopal event that occurred while she was walking.  Cardiac examination reveals a grade 3 /6  systolic murmur,  heard best at the right upper sternal border.  There is radiation of the murmur into the neck.  The valvular abnormality that most likely caused this episode is Choices: a) aortic insufficiency b) aortic stenosis c) mitral regurgitation d) mitral stenosis 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the characteristics of the murmur described.  It is a systolic murmur,  grade 3/6,  heard best at the right upper sternal border,  and it radiates into the neck.
 Next,  I need to consider the valvular abnormalities that can produce such a murmur.  Aortic insufficiency (AI) can produce a systolic murmur that radiates into the neck,  as the murmur is due to the regurgitant flow from the aorta back into the left ventricle.  Aortic stenosis (AS) typically produces a systolic ejection murmur,  but it does not radiate into the neck.  Mitral regurgitation (MR) can produce a systolic murmur that radiates into the neck,  but it is usually a diastolic murmur.  Mitral stenosis (MS) typically produces a systolic,  late systolic,  or early diastolic murmur,  but it does not radiate into the neck.
 Based on the characteristics of the murmur,  the most likely valvular abnormality causing this episode is aortic insufficiency (AI).
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Three weeks ago a 45 -year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of frostbite of both feet.  He was treated by rapid rewarming and protective care of the feet.  All the toes on the right foot have turned black.  He has become slightly febrile and progressively more confused during the past few days.  Examination discloses cellulitis in the midfoot.  Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?  Choices: a) Amputation b) Application of topical collagenase c) Debridement of necrotic skin over the toes d) Hyperbaric oxygen 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the severity of the patient's condition.  He has developed cellulitis,  which indicates an infection.  The toes on his right foot have turned black,  indicating necrosis.  He has also become febrile and more confused,  suggesting systemic infection.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the options for treatment.  Amputation (a) is a drastic measure and should be considered only if other treatments have failed.  Application of topical collagenase (b) may help with soft tissue healing,  but it is not a primary treatment for sepsis or cellulitis.  Debridement of necrotic skin over the toes (c) is a necessary step to remove dead tissue and prevent infection,  but it does not address the systemic infection or the cellulitis itself.  Hyperbaric oxygen (d) is a treatment for various conditions,  including wound healing and decompression sickness,  but it is not specifically indicated for sepsis or cellulitis.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate treatment is to address the systemic infection and cellulitis first,  and then proceed with debridement of necrotic skin.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 35 -year-old man comes to the office because of 1 -week history of mid low back pain that radiates down his right leg.  The pain began after the patient lifted a heavy box onto his truck.  He rates his current pain as an 8  on a 10 -point scale.  He has been unable to find a comfortable position and has been sleeping in a recliner.  Medical history is unremarkable and he takes no medications.  He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 25  years,  and he drinks a six-pack of beer on Friday and Saturday nights.  BMI is 27  kg/m2  .  He appears uncomfortable and stands during the physical examination.  Vital signs are normal.  Straight-leg raise test is positive on the right,  with loss of right ankle reflex.  The remainder of the physical examination discloses no abnormalities.  Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient’s symptoms?  Choices: a) Displacement of the nucleus pulposus b) Hypertrophy of the facet joints c) Osteophyte formation d) Spondylolisthesis 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and symptoms.  The pain began after lifting a heavy object and radiates down the right leg,  suggesting a possible lumbar disc problem.  The patient's age and smoking history are also significant,  as they increase the risk of lumbar disc issues.
 Next,  I need to consider the physical examination findings.  The straight-leg raise test is positive on the right,  with loss of right ankle reflex,  which is suggestive of a lumbar disc herniation.
 Given these clues,  the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms is a) Displacement of the nucleus pulposis.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 35 -year-old man comes to the physician because of pain and swelling of his right arm where he scraped it on a tree branch 2  days ago.  His temperature is 38.3 °C (101 °F).  Examination of the right forearm shows edema around a fluctuant erythematous lesion at the site of trauma.  The area is extremely tender to palpation.  Which of the following is most likely the primary mechanism of the development of edema in this patient?  Choices: a) Disruption of vascular basement membranes b) Increased hydrostatic pressure c) Release of thromboxane d) Separation of endothelial junctions 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation of the patient.  The patient has pain,  swelling,  and a fluctuant erythematous lesion at the site of trauma,  which are all signs of an infection.  The tender nature of the area also indicates inflammation.
 Next,  I need to consider the mechanisms of edema formation.  Edema is the accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space,  which can be caused by various factors.
 a) Disruption of vascular basement membranes is not a common mechanism of edema formation in this context.
 b) Increased hydrostatic pressure can cause edema,  but it is not typically the primary mechanism in the context of an infection.
 c) Release of thromboxane is a mediator of inflammation,  which can cause increased permeability of blood vessels,  allowing fluid to leak into the interstitial space,  leading to edema.
 d) Separation of endothelial junctions can also cause increased permeability,  but it is not as directly related to the inflammatory process as the release of thromboxane.
 Therefore,  the most likely primary mechanism of edema development in this patient is the release of thromboxane.

"Input: A 22 -year-old woman comes to the physician in October for a follow-up examination.  She feels well.  She has a 2 -year history of type 1  diabetes mellitus controlled with insulin.  She had a normal Pap smear 3  months ago and saw her ophthalmologist 6  months ago.  Her 67 -year-old grandmother has breast cancer.  She is 168  cm (5  ft 6  in) tall and weighs 57  kg (125  lb); BMI is 20  kg/m2  .  Her hemoglobin A1 c is 6.2 %,  and fingerstick blood glucose concentration is 118  mg/dL.  Which of the following health maintenance recommendations is most appropriate at this time?  Choices: a) Dietary modification for weight loss b) Human papillomavirus testing c) Mammography d) Influenza virus vaccine 
 Output:
 First,  I need to assess the patient's current health status and risk factors.  She has type 1 diabetes mellitus well controlled with insulin,  a normal Pap smear,  and a normal ophthalmologic examination.  Her grandmother's breast cancer does not place her at immediate risk for breast cancer.  Her BMI is within the normal range.
 Next,  I need to consider the recommendations based on her current health status and risk factors.  Dietary modification for weight loss is not necessary since her BMI is within the normal range.  Human papillomavirus testing is not indicated since she had a normal Pap smear 3  months ago.  Mammography is not indicated for her age and family history.  The influenza virus vaccine is recommended annually for all adults with chronic conditions like diabetes.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate health maintenance recommendation at this time is {'sol': 'd'}"

Physical examination shows decreased range of motion in the affected hand.  The patient is upset that his hand has not fully healed,  and he files a malpractice suit against the physician.  Which of the following is the most likely precipitating factor in this patient's decision to file a malpractice suit?  Choices: a) The patient's perception that the physician is incompetent b) The patient's perception that the physician is uncaring c) The patient's socioeconomic status d) The physician's amount of experience in the medical field 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the information provided in the input.  The patient is 42  years old and has undergone repair of a Dupuytren contracture four months ago.  He has a decreased range of motion in the affected hand and is upset that his hand has not fully healed.  He files a malpractice suit against the physician.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the choices provided.  a) The patient's perception that the physician is incompetent, b) The patient's perception that the physician is uncaring, c) The patient's socioeconomic status, and d) The physician's amount of experience in the medical field.
 To determine the most likely precipitating factor, I need to consider which choice is most directly related to the patient's decision to file a malpractice suit.  The patient is upset that his hand has not fully healed, and he believes the physician is responsible. This indicates that the patient's perception of the physician's competence is likely the most significant factor.
 Therefore,  the most likely precipitating factor in this patient's decision to file a malpractice suit is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: During a study of renal glomeruli,  a healthy animal kidney is kept in a vascular bath preparation at a constant afferent arterial pressure of 100  mm Hg.  If the efferent arteriole is constricted with a vascular clamp,  which of the following Starling forces is most likely to change in the glomeruli?  Choices: a) Decreased filtration coefficient (Kf) b) Decreased hydrostatic pressure c) Decreased oncotic pressure d) Increased hydrostatic pressure 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the Starling equation,  which describes the forces that determine the filtration rate in the glomeruli.  The equation is: Filtration = (Kf * (Pas - Pes)) - (πoc * (Pes - Pcs)),  where Pas is the pressure in the afferent arteriole,  Pes is the pressure in the efferent arteriole,  Kf is the filtration coefficient,  πoc is the oncotic pressure,  and Pcs is the capillary pressure.

Next,  we need to consider the situation described in the question.  The afferent arterial pressure (Pas) is kept constant at 100 mm Hg,  and the efferent arteriole is constricted with a vascular clamp.  This constriction will lead to a decrease in the pressure in the efferent arteriole (Pes).

Now,  we need to determine which of the Starling forces is most likely to change due to this decrease in Pes.  Since the decrease in Pes is directly subtracted from the product of Kf and (Pas - Pes) in the equation,  a decrease in Pes will lead to an increase in the filtration rate due to the hydrostatic pressure component of the equation.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 30 -year-old woman,  gravida 2,  para 0,  aborta 1,  at 28  weeks' gestation comes to the office for a prenatal visit.  She has had one previous pregnancy resulting in a spontaneous abortion at 12  weeks' gestation.  Today,  her vital signs are within normal limits.  Physical examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 28 -week gestation.  Fetal ultrasonography shows a male fetus with no abnormalities.  Her blood group is O,  Rh-negative.  The father's blood group is B,  Rh-positive.  The physician recommends administration of Rho Choices: a) immune globulin to the patient.  This treatment is most likely to prevent which of the following in this mother?  b) Development of natural killer cells c) Development of polycythemia d) Formation of antibodies to RhD 
 Output:
 First, let's analyze the situation. The mother is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive. This means the baby has Rh-positive blood. During pregnancy, there is a risk of Rh incompatibility, where the mother's body may produce antibodies against the Rh-positive blood of the baby, which can cause hemolytic disease of the newborn if the mother carries a Rh-positive baby again.

The recommended treatment in this case is the administration of Rho(D) immune globulin to the mother. This treatment is most likely to prevent the formation of antibodies to RhD in the mother.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 46 -year-old man with Marfan syndrome,  aortic insufficiency,  and mitral regurgitation comes to the emergency department because he has had severe substernal chest pain for the past 3  hours.  He describes the pain as tearing in quality and radiating to the neck.  One week earlier he experienced similar but less severe chest pain and treated himself with aspirin.  Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause for his worsening symptoms?  Choices: a) Acute bacterial endocarditis b) Acute myocardial infarction c) Dissection of the aorta d) Esophageal reflux with spasm 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and symptoms.  He has Marfan syndrome,  aortic insufficiency,  and mitral regurgitation,  which are all risk factors for aortic dissection.  The chest pain is severe,  tearing in quality,  and radiates to the neck,  which are classic symptoms of aortic dissection.  One week earlier,  he experienced similar but less severe chest pain,  which could be a sign of an ongoing process leading to worsening symptoms.
 Next,  I need to consider the other choices.  Acute bacterial endocarditis is unlikely because the patient has no signs of infection,  such as fever or positive catheterization findings.  Acute myocardial infarction is less likely because the chest pain is not typical for an MI,  and there are no risk factors for an MI,  such as hypertension or diabetes.  Esophageal reflux with spasm is also less likely because the pain is not typical for gastroesophageal reflux disease and there is no history of acid reflux or heartburn.
 Based on the patient's history and symptoms,  the most likely underlying cause for his worsening symptoms is aortic dissection.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 47 -year-old man is admitted to the hospital through the emergency department because of the sudden onset of palpitations,  left-sided chest pain,  light-headedness,  and shortness of breath that began while he was watching television 2  hours ago.  Medical history is remarkable for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  The patient is 180  cm (5  ft 11  in) tall and weighs 82  kg (180  lb); BMI is 25  kg/m2  .  ECG obtained in the emergency department showed atrial fibrillation with narrow QRS complex.  Pulse was 146 /min.  Physical examination was remarkable for rapid heart rate.  The patient was given oxygen via nasal cannula and intravenous metoprolol 5  mg every 5  minutes for a total of 15  mg.  His pulse slowed to 90 /min.  Two hours after admission,  he is pain free but his pulse is now 160 /min.  Blood pressure is 122 /78  mm Hg.  In order to decrease the patient's pulse,  which of the following should be administered intravenously?  Choices: a) Digoxin b) Enalapril c) Lidocaine d) Metoprolol 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the cause of the rapid heart rate.  The patient has atrial fibrillation,  which is causing the rapid heart rate.
 Next,  I need to consider the options for treating atrial fibrillation.  Digoxin is a medication used to treat atrial fibrillation,  so it could be a potential option.

Neurologic examination shows weakness of the extensor and flexor muscles of the lower extremities.  Knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes are exaggerated.  Sensation to vibration and position is decreased in all extremities,  but the decrease is more prominent in the lower extremities than in the upper extremities.  This patient most likely has a deficiency of which of the following vitamins?  Choices: a) Vitamin B1  (thiamine) b) Vitamin B2  (riboflavin) c) Vitamin B6  (pyridoxine) d) Vitamin B12  (cyanocobalamin) 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the symptoms and the neurologic examination findings that are consistent with a vitamin deficiency.  The patient presents with diffuse weakness and tingling of the arms and legs,  which are symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.  The exaggerated knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes and decreased sensation to vibration and position in all extremities are also consistent with peripheral neuropathy.
 Next,  I need to consider which vitamins are known to cause peripheral neuropathy.  Vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency is associated with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome,  which primarily affects the brain and is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.  Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) deficiency can cause dermatitis,  xerosis,  and angular cheilitis,  but not peripheral neuropathy.  Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) deficiency can cause dermatitis,  xerosis,  and neuropsychiatric symptoms,  but not peripheral neuropathy.  Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) deficiency is associated with peripheral neuropathy,  which is consistent with the patient's symptoms and neurologic examination findings.

All patients enrolled in the study are informed that they would be treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  They are assigned to successive dose cohorts of 300  to 1000  mg/day of the drug.  Six to eight patients are assigned to each dose.  Treatment efficacy is determined based on the results of complete blood counts and bone marrow assessments conducted regularly throughout the study.  This study is best described as which of the following?  Choices: a) Case-control study b) Crossover study c) Open-labeled clinical trial d) Randomized clinical trial 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key features of the study design.  The study is conducted over 1  year and aims to assess the antileukemic activity of a new tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  Patients are informed that they will be treated with the drug and are assigned to successive dose cohorts.  The treatment efficacy is determined based on regular assessments.

Next,  I need to consider the study design types given as choices.  A case-control study compares patients with a specific disease to a control group without the disease.  A crossover study involves participants receiving different treatments in a sequential manner.  An open-labeled clinical trial allows participants to know they are receiving the study drug, but there is no random assignment of treatments.  A randomized clinical trial involves random assignment of participants to different treatment groups.

In this study,  patients are informed they will receive the drug,  but they are assigned to different dose cohorts,  which implies a form of randomization.  The treatment efficacy is determined based on the actual treatment received,  not based on a comparison group.

"Input: A 25 -year-old man comes to the emergency department because he developed chest pain and shortness of breath 1  hour ago,  shortly after snorting cocaine for the first time.  He rates the chest pain as a 7  on a 10 -point scale and notes that the pain is radiating down his left arm.  Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications or any other illicit drugs.  He is 178  cm (5  ft 10  in) tall and weighs 70  kg (154  lb); BMI is 22  kg/m2  .  The patient is diaphoretic.  Vital signs are temperature 37.5 °C (99.5 °F),  pulse 110 /min,  respirations 16 /min,  and blood pressure 200 /100  mm Hg.  Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95 %.  Pupils are equal,  round,  and reactive to light and accommodation.  Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion.  Auscultation of the heart discloses an audible S1  and S2.  There is no edema,  cyanosis,  or clubbing of the digits.  The patient is fully oriented.  He is treated with supplemental oxygen,  a 325 -mg aspirin tablet,  and intravenous nitroglycerin and lorazepam.  Despite therapy,  he continues to have chest pain and shortness of breath.  ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities.  Which of the following is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time?  Choices: a) Carvedilol b) Furosemide c) Metoprolol d) Phentolamine 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's presentation.  The patient is a young man with chest pain,  shortness of breath,  and hypertension,  all of which are suggestive of a myocardial infarction.  The fact that the chest pain is radiating down the left arm and there are no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities on the ECG also support this diagnosis.
 Next,  I need to consider the pharmacotherapy options.  Carvedilol is a beta-blocker that can help reduce myocardial oxygen demand and improve myocardial perfusion,  which is appropriate for a myocardial infarction.  Furosemide is an diuretic that can help manage fluid overload,  but it is not specific to myocardial infarction.  Metoprolol is another beta-blocker,  but it is less commonly used in the acute phase of myocardial infarction.  Phentolamine is an alpha-blocker that can help reduce peripheral vascular resistance,  but it is not typically used in the acute phase of myocardial infarction.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time is {'sol': 'a'}"

Results of the trial showed no overall benefit of the vaccine.  However,  post hoc analysis disclosed a small but statistically significant vaccine protection among African American subjects.  Which of the following is the most accurate rationale for questioning the validity of efficacy analysis of the HIV vaccine among the African American study subjects?  Choices: a) HIV infection is more prevalent among African American populations b) The study was not blinded c) There was a Type II error d) Vaccine response among African American subjects was not the primary outcome measure 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the information given about the study.  The study enrolled 4000  subjects,  with 1900  being women and 2100  being men.  There were different ethnic groups,  with 1000  African American subjects.  The trial showed no overall benefit of the vaccine,  but a small but statistically significant protection was found among African American subjects.

Next,  I need to evaluate the choices given to determine the most accurate rationale for questioning the validity of the efficacy analysis among African American subjects.

a) HIV infection is more prevalent among African American populations - This choice suggests that the higher prevalence of HIV in African American populations could affect the results.  However,  this does not necessarily question the validity of the efficacy analysis among the African American subjects.

b) The study was not blinded - This choice suggests that lack of blinding could affect the results.  However,  this does not specifically question the validity of the efficacy analysis among the African American subjects.

c) There was a Type II error - This choice suggests that the study may have failed to detect a true effect, which could question the validity of the efficacy analysis among the African American subjects.

d) Vaccine response among African American subjects was not the primary outcome measure - This choice suggests that the analysis may not have been designed to specifically look at the vaccine response among African American subjects,  which could question the validity of the efficacy analysis among the African American subjects.

Based on the evaluation,  the most accurate rationale for questioning the validity of the efficacy analysis of the HIV vaccine among the African American study subjects is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 33 -year-old male physician reports for a shift in the emergency department.  A nurse alerts you that he noticed a faint odor of alcohol near the physician.  When approached,  the physician appears tired and more disheveled than usual.  There is an odor of alcohol on his breath.  He is a skilled and talented physician with no known history of substance or alcohol use disorder.  He is married with three children,  and his wife is pregnant with twins.  The physician was recently hired and has had no actions on his license by any state medical board.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?  Choices: a) Ask the physician if he is sober,  and if he says yes,  allow him to complete his shift b) Explain to the physician that you suspect he is intoxicated and ask him to submit to a blood sample to check his blood alcohol concentration c) Relieve the physician of duty and alert the hospital's patient safety officer d) Tell the physician that you can cover the remainder of the shift alone,  so that he can sleep in his office 
 Output:
 First,  it is important to assess the situation and determine if the physician is actually intoxicated.  The physician appears tired and disheveled,  and there is an odor of alcohol on his breath.  However,  he has no known history of substance or alcohol use disorder,  and his recent actions have not been problematic.
 Next,  it is crucial to consider the potential consequences of the physician being intoxicated while on duty.  The physician is responsible for caring for patients in the emergency department,  and his ability to perform his duties could be compromised if he is intoxicated.
 Considering these factors,  the most appropriate next step is to explain to the physician that you suspect he is intoxicated and ask him to submit to a blood sample to check his blood alcohol concentration.  This will help to confirm or refute the suspicion and ensure patient safety.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 22 -year-old man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination.  He feels well.  He has had a painless left scrotal mass since childhood.  Examination shows a 6 -cm,  soft,  nontender left scrotal mass that transilluminates; there are no bowel sounds in the mass.  Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities.  Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?  Choices: a) Accumulation of scrotal adipose tissue b) Cryptorchidism of the left testis c) Dilation of the pampiniform plexus of veins around the testis d) Persistence of a patent processus vaginalis 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the characteristics of the mass.  It is a painless,  soft,  nontender mass that transilluminates.  Transillumination suggests that the mass is gas-filled and not solid.
 Next,  I need to consider the location of the mass.  It is in the scrotum,  which is where the testis is located.
 Finally,  I need to consider the absence of bowel sounds in the mass and the absence of abnormalities in the examination of the testis.  This suggests that the mass is not related to the testis or the bowel.
 Based on these characteristics,  the most likely cause of the mass is accumulation of scrotal adipose tissue (a).
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 3 -year-old boy with chronic granulomatous disease is brought to the physician because of a 3 -week history of fever and warm,  red lumps under both arms.  His temperature is 38 °C (100.4 °F).  Physical examination shows enlarged,  3 -cm,  erythematous axillary lymph nodes bilaterally.  On palpation,  the nodes are tender,  fluctuant,  and movable.  Examination of a fine-needle aspirate from one of the nodes shows gram-positive cocci in clusters.  Cultures of the aspirate grow yellow,  βhemolytic colonies that are catalase and coagulase positive.  A polymerase chain reaction test shows mecA-positive organisms.  Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?  Choices: a) Ciprofloxacin b) Penicillin G c) Rifampin d) Vancomycin 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the causative agent of the infection.  The patient has gram-positive cocci in clusters,  which indicates a staphylococcal infection.  The cultures are catalase and coagulase positive,  which further supports this diagnosis.  The polymerase chain reaction test shows mecA-positive organisms,  indicating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
 Next,  I need to consider the patient's condition.  The patient has chronic granulomatous disease,  which makes him more susceptible to infections,  including MRSA.
 Now,  I need to choose the most appropriate pharmacotherapy.  Among the choices,  ciprofloxacin (a) is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is effective against MRSA,  but it is not the first choice for patients with neutropenia or severe neutropenia,  due to the risk of CNS toxicity.
 Penicillin G (b) is not effective against methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus.
 Rifampin (c) is an antiretroviral drug and is not effective against Staphylococcus aureus.
 Vancomycin (d) is an antibiotic that is effective against methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus,  including MRSA,  and is considered the first-line therapy for MRSA infections in neutropenic patients.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 35 -year-old man with spina bifida is admitted to the hospital for a urologic procedure.  He has been functionally independent in activities of daily living and is employed doing inventory control in a local sporting goods store.  He has maintained continence through periodic self-catheterization.  The patient is paraplegic,  has recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stones,  and recent onset of incontinence secondary to detrusor and bladder neck dysfunction.  Vital signs are normal.  Physical examination shows a well-developed,  well-nourished man in no acute distress.  Aside from paraplegia,  lower extremity muscle atrophy,  and lower abdominal surgical scars,  the physical examination discloses no abnormalities.  He had an episode of anaphylaxis secondary to latex allergy during a previous operation for functional expansion of his bladder through a bowel anastomosis.  Which of the following is most important to consider in the care of this patient?  Choices: a) Administration of injectable medications with disposable syringes b) Preparation of food by outside contractors c) Type of cleaning agents used to sterilize bed linens d) Use of rubber urethral catheters 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's medical history and current condition.  The patient has spina bifida,  is paraplegic,  has recurrent kidney stones,  and has a latex allergy.  He is currently experiencing incontinence due to detrusor and bladder neck dysfunction.
 Next,  I need to identify the options that could pose a risk to the patient's health or well-being.  Option a) could be relevant if the patient needs injectable medications,  but it does not directly address the patient's specific needs.  Option b) is not directly related to the patient's medical condition or risk factors.  Option c) could be important for preventing infections,  but it does not directly address the patient's latex allergy.  Option d) is directly related to the patient's latex allergy and could pose a risk if rubber urethral catheters are used.
 Therefore,  the most important factor to consider in the care of this patient is the use of rubber urethral catheters due to his latex allergy.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 6 -month-old male Hispanic infant is brought to the office by his parents because of intermittent swelling of his right scrotum that is more pronounced when he cries.  The swelling has never been red or ""stuck. "" Vital signs are normal.  A right inguinal hernia is confirmed on physical examination.  In discussing repair of the hernia with the parents,  it is most appropriate to inform them of which of the following?  Choices: a) Herniorrhaphy can be postponed until age 2  years because many hernias close spontaneously b) Herniorrhaphy can be postponed until age 12  years because oligospermia does not develop before age 12  c) Herniorrhaphy should be scheduled at the earliest convenient time d) Herniorrhaphy should be scheduled as an emergency operation 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the age at which inguinal hernias in infants typically close spontaneously.  It is known that most inguinal hernias in infants close spontaneously by 18 months of age.
 Next,  I need to consider the potential long-term consequences of leaving the hernia untreated.  There is a risk of developing testicular atrophy or even infertility if the hernia is not repaired before the child reaches puberty.
 However,  there is no evidence that suggests hernias close spontaneously until age 2  years or that oligospermia develops only after age 12  years.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate course of action is to schedule the hernia repair at the earliest convenient time,  as it is not an emergency operation.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 67 -year-old woman comes to the physician because of dizziness for 6  weeks.  When she stands up suddenly,  she becomes light-headed and has to steady herself for approximately 1  to 2  minutes before she is able to walk.  She has hypertension and type 2  diabetes mellitus.  Current medications include glyburide,  a diuretic,  a β-adrenergic blocking agent,  and an angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.  Her pulse is 55 /min.  Her blood pressure is 110 /70  mm Hg in the right arm and 70 /50  mm Hg in the left arm while supine; her blood pressure is 70 /50  mm Hg in the right arm and 50 /30  mm Hg in the left arm immediately after standing.  Neurologic examination shows no focal findings.  An ECG shows sinus bradycardia with no evidence of ischemia.  Carotid duplex ultrasonography shows reverse flow in the left vertebral artery with no evidence of occlusion.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?  Choices: a) Cardiac stress scintigraphy b) Adjusting her medication regimen c) Warfarin therapy d) Transesophageal echocardiography 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the cause of the dizziness.  The patient has hypertension,  type 2  diabetes mellitus,  sinus bradycardia,  and reverse flow in the left vertebral artery.  The reverse flow in the left vertebral artery could be due to a patent foramen ovale (PFO),  which allows left-to-right shunting of blood,  leading to decreased blood pressure in the left arm when standing.
 Next,  I need to determine the most appropriate next step in management.  The options are:
 a) Cardiac stress scintigraphy: This is not the most appropriate next step because the ECG shows no evidence of ischemia.
 b) Adjusting her medication regimen: This could be a possible next step,  but it is not the most appropriate next step because the dizziness is likely due to the reverse flow in the left vertebral artery,  which may not be resolved by adjusting the medication regimen.
 c) Warfarin therapy: This is not the most appropriate next step because there is no evidence of thromboembolic disease.
 d) Transesophageal echocardiography: This is the most appropriate next step because it can directly visualize the cardiac structures and assess the presence of a PFO,  which could be the cause of the dizziness.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 17 -year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because she has not had a menstrual period for 6  months.  The patient is unconcerned about the lack of menses.  Menarche occurred at the age of 12  years,  and menses had occurred at regular 28 -day intervals until they became irregular 1  year ago.  She is a member of her high school gymnastics team.  She appears emaciated.  She is 163  cm (5  ft 4  in) tall and weighs 40  kg (88  lb); BMI is 15  kg/m2  .  Her pulse is 54 /min,  and blood pressure is 80 /50  mm Hg.  Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's amenorrhea?  Choices: a) Hyperthyroidism b) Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism c) Hypothyroidism d) Polycystic ovarian syndrome 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and physical examination.  She is a 17 -year-old girl with a history of regular menstrual periods that became irregular 1  year ago,  and now she has not had a period for 6  months.  She is a member of her high school gymnastics team and appears emaciated.  Her weight is 40  kg (88  lb),  and her BMI is 15  kg/m2 .  Her blood pressure is low,  at 80 /50  mm Hg.  Based on this information,  it is likely that the patient has a condition that is causing her to lose weight and have amenorrhea.
 Next,  I need to consider the possible causes of amenorrhea in a 17 -year-old girl.  Hyperthyroidism can cause irregular periods,  but it is unlikely to cause amenorrhea in a young woman.  Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism can cause amenorrhea,  but it is less common in young women.  Hypothyroidism can cause irregular periods and weight gain,  so it is less likely in this case.  Polycystic ovarian syndrome can cause irregular periods and amenorrhea,  especially in a young woman who is not concerned about her lack of menses.
 Therefore,  the most likely cause of this patient's amenorrhea is polycystic ovarian syndrome.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 2 -year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination.  He was delivered at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy.  His birth weight was 3500  g (7  lb 11  oz),  and Apgar scores were 8  and 10  at 1  and 5  minutes,  respectively.  At the age of 15  months,  physical examination showed no abnormalities,  but he was not yet talking.  Both of his parents had learning difficulties in school,  and his mother stopped attending after the 10 th grade.  He has a maternal uncle with cognitive disabilities.  He is at the 25 th percentile for height,  15 th percentile for weight,  and 90 th percentile for head circumference.  He appears irritable,  he resists making eye contact,  and he is flapping his hands.  Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?  Choices: a) Frameshift mutation b) Missense mutation c) Nonsense mutation d) Trinucleotide repeat expansion 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's developmental milestones and family history.  He is 15  months old but not yet talking,  which is concerning.  Both of his parents had learning difficulties,  and his maternal uncle has cognitive disabilities.  Additionally,  he shows signs of irritability,  resists making eye contact,  and has hand flapping,  which are all suggestive of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
 Next,  I need to consider the genetic causes of ASD.  Frameshift mutations,  missense mutations,  nonsense mutations,  and trinucleotide repeat expansion are all genetic mutations that can cause ASD.  However,  trinucleotide repeat expansion is the most common genetic cause of ASD.
 Therefore,  the most likely cause of this patient's condition is trinucleotide repeat expansion,  which corresponds to option d) Trinucleotide repeat expansion.

"Input: A 20 -year-old man has had frequent upper respiratory tract infections over the past 4  years.  He has daily purulent sputum and has noted decreased exercise tolerance over the past 2  years.  He and his wife have been unable to conceive because of his low sperm count.  Scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields.  An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation.  Spirometry shows a decreased FEV1 :FVC ratio.  Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?  Choices: a) Arterial blood gas analysis b) Examination of sputum for eosinophils c) Sweat chloride test d) Sputum cytology 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and findings presented.  The patient has frequent upper respiratory infections,  purulent sputum, decreased exercise tolerance, low sperm count, and lung abnormalities.  These symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
 To confirm the diagnosis of IPF,  I need to find evidence of fibrosing alveolitis,  which is a hallmark of the disease.  This can be done through a sweat chloride test,  which is a specific test for IPF.
 Therefore,  the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 37 -year-old woman with right lower extremity edema is evaluated because of the sudden onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain.  A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is made.  Which of the following signs,  if present on physical examination,  would be the most specific indicator of pulmonary arterial hypertension in this patient?  Choices: a) Increased jugular venous pressure b) P2  louder than A2  c) Peripheral edema d) Presence of an S3  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the question and identify the key information.  The patient is a 37 -year-old woman with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism,  and we are looking for a sign that would be the most specific indicator of pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Next,  I need to consider the choices given and evaluate their relevance to pulmonary arterial hypertension.  a) Increased jugular venous pressure is related to right heart strain,  not necessarily pulmonary arterial hypertension.  b) P2  louder than A2  can indicate aortic stenosis,  not pulmonary arterial hypertension.  c) Peripheral edema is a common sign of chronic pulmonary arterial hypertension,  but it is not specific to pulmonary arterial hypertension and can be seen in other conditions as well.  d) Presence of an S3  can indicate increased filling pressures,  which could be related to pulmonary arterial hypertension,  but it is not specific to pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Therefore,  the most specific indicator of pulmonary arterial hypertension in this patient would be peripheral edema (choice c).  The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 32 -year-old woman,  gravida 3,  para 2,  at 41  weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor.  Pregnancy has been complicated by mild asthma treated with inhaled bronchodilators.  At the beginning of the second stage of labor,  the cervix is 100 % effaced and 10  cm dilated; the vertex is at -1  station.  The fetal heart rate is reactive with no decelerations.  After 10  minutes of pushing,  there is a prolonged deceleration to 60 /min.  The patient has the acute onset of shortness of breath,  rapidly develops cyanosis,  and becomes unresponsive.  Her pulse and blood pressure cannot be detected.  Immediate resuscitation is started.  Five minutes later,  there is bleeding from the nose,  mouth,  and intravenous sites.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  Choices: a) Amniotic fluid embolism b) Intracerebral hemorrhage c) Myocardial infarction d) Status asmaticus 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and the context of the patient's condition.  The patient is in active labor,  and the deceleration of the fetal heart rate is prolonged to 60 /min.  Shortness of breath,  cyanosis,  unresponsiveness,  and the inability to detect pulse and blood pressure are all concerning for a serious complication.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the options given.  Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare but life-threatening condition that can occur during childbirth,  causing sudden onset of symptoms such as shortness of breath,  cyanosis,  and hemorrhage.  Intracerebral hemorrhage is a serious brain bleed that can cause similar symptoms,  but it is less likely in this context.  Myocardial infarction is a heart attack,  which is also unlikely in this context.  Status asthmaticus is a severe asthma attack that persists for hours,  which does not fit the sudden onset of symptoms.
 Based on the symptoms and the context,  the most likely diagnosis is amniotic fluid embolism,  as it fits the sudden onset of symptoms and the hemorrhage seen in the patient.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

He has a 15 -year career history of sandblasting old buildings.  He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for the past 30  years.  The patient is 168  cm (5  ft 6  in) tall and weighs 59  kg (130  lb); BMI is 21  kg/m2  .  Vital signs are temperature 36.8 °C (98.2 °F),  pulse 94 /min,  and blood pressure 150 /92  mm Hg.  Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 70 %.  On physical examination he is in moderately severe distress with pursed lips and cyanotic nail beds.  Chest has an increased anteroposterior diameter.  Auscultation of the chest discloses scattered wheezes and rhonchi over all lung fields.  Cardiac examination discloses muffled heart sounds and an S4.  Fingers are clubbed.  Chest x-ray shows hyperinflated lungs,  flattened diaphragm,  large,  irregular opacities in the upper lobes,  and eggshell calcifications of the hilar lymph nodes.  In addition to antibiotic therapy,  which of the following is the most appropriate intervention?  Choices: a) Azathioprine therapy b) Bronchoscopy c) Continuous humidified oxygen d) Nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)

"Input: A 32 -year-old woman,  gravida 2,  para 1,  at 8  weeks' gestation comes to the physician for her first prenatal visit.  She delivered her first child spontaneously at 34  weeks' gestation; pregnancy was complicated by iron deficiency anemia.  She has no other history of serious illness.  Her blood pressure is 100 /70  mm Hg.  Examination shows no abnormalities.  Ultrasonography shows a dichorionic-diamniotic twin intrauterine pregnancy consistent in size with an 8 -week gestation.  This patient is at increased risk for which of the following complications?  Choices: a) Abruptio placentae b) Fetal chromosome abnormality c) Hyperthyroidism d) Preterm labor and delivery 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and risk factors for each complication.
 Abruptio placentae is a complication of preeclampsia, which is more common in pregnancies with a gestational age of 20 weeks or more.  Since this patient is only 8 weeks pregnant,  she is not at increased risk for abruptio placentae.
 Fetal chromosome abnormality is a random event and not related to the patient's history or gestational age.  Therefore,  she is not at increased risk for fetal chromosome abnormality.
 Hyperthyroidism is more common in women with a history of thyroid disorders or taking certain medications.  Since the patient has no history of serious illness,  she is not at increased risk for hyperthyroidism.
 Preterm labor and delivery is a risk for women with a history of spontaneous preterm labor or preterm birth,  as seen in this patient.  Since she delivered her first child spontaneously at 34 weeks' gestation,  she is at increased risk for preterm labor and delivery.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 46 -year-old woman with active ankylosing spondylitis comes to the office for a follow-up examination.  The use of various conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been ineffective.  Sulfasalazine treatment also has not resulted in improvement.  The most appropriate next step in treatment is administration of a drug that inhibits which of the following?  Choices: a) Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4  b) Epidermal growth factor c) Interleukin-1  (IL-1 ) d) Tumor necrosis factor α 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's condition and the treatment that has been ineffective.  The patient has active ankylosing spondylitis,  a disease characterized by inflammation and joint damage.  The conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and sulfasalazine have been ineffective,  suggesting that the patient's condition is not adequately controlled by these traditional treatments.

Next,  I need to identify the most appropriate drug to target the specific inflammatory mediators in this case.  Ankylosing spondylitis is associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α),  a cytokine that plays a key role in the inflammatory response.  Inhibition of TNF-α has been shown to be effective in treating various inflammatory diseases,  including ankylosing spondylitis.

Therefore,  the most appropriate next step in treatment is to administer a drug that inhibits TNF-α.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 50 -year-old female presents to the office with the complaints of chronic achiness,  stiffness,  and fatigue.  Physical examination reveals multiple bilateral tender points in the trapezius,  gluteal,  and suboccipital muscle groups.  Radiograph findings and laboratory study results are normal.  The most likely diagnosis is Choices: a) ankylosing spondylitis b) fibromyalgia c) myofascial pain syndrome d) osteoarthritis 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's age and gender,  which are both risk factors for fibromyalgia.  The patient is 50 years old and female,  which are common demographics for fibromyalgia.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the clinical findings.  The patient has multiple tender points in specific muscle groups,  which is a hallmark of fibromyalgia.  Radiograph findings and laboratory study results are normal,  which means there are no other explanations for the patient's symptoms.
 Finally,  I need to compare the findings to the other diagnoses.  Ankylosing spondylitis typically presents with lower back pain and radiographic abnormalities,  which are not present in this case.  Myofascial pain syndrome typically presents with localized pain and referred pain,  which does not match the patient's symptoms.  Osteoarthritis typically presents with joint pain and swelling,  which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.
 Therefore,  the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: An 18 -year-old man is brought to the emergency department 10  minutes after he sustained a stab wound to his chest.  On arrival,  he is unresponsive to painful stimuli.  His pulse is 130 /min,  respirations are 8 /min and shallow,  and palpable systolic blood pressure is 60  mm Hg.  He is intubated and mechanically ventilated,  and infusion of 0.9 % saline is begun.  After 5  minutes,  his pulse is 130 /min,  and blood pressure is 70 /40  mm Hg.  Examination shows a 2 -cm wound at the left sixth intercostal space at the midclavicular line.  There is jugular venous distention.  Breath sounds are normal.  The trachea is at the midline.  Heart sounds are not audible.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?  Choices: a) Chest x-ray b) Echocardiography c) Bronchoscopy d) Pericardiocentesis 
 Output:
 First,  I need to assess the patient's airway,  breathing,  and circulation (ABCs).  The patient is unresponsive to painful stimuli,  has shallow and rapid respirations,  and has a low blood pressure.  These are signs of a life-threatening situation.
 The most appropriate next step in management is to stabilize the patient's circulation by increasing his blood pressure.  This can be done by administering fluid resuscitation.

"Input: A 55 -year-old male presents to the emergency department with a 2 -day history of severe epigastric pain and vomiting.  Past medical history is negative for any similar episodes.  He does not take any medications.  He smokes cigarettes,  has a 40  pack-year history,  and consumes more than 8  cans of beer per day.  Abdominal examination reveals epigastric tenderness.  Laboratory studies reveal a serum amylase level of 467  U/L (reference range: 28 -100  U/L) and a γ-glutamyltransferase level of 212  U/L (reference range: < 55  U/L).  Referred pain in this patient is transmitted to the spinal cord by which of the following nerves?  Choices: a) anterior rami of T1 -T5  b) anterior rami of T6 -T10  c) anterior rami of T11 -T12  d) posterior rami of T1 -T5  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the location of the pain and the patient's history.  The patient presents with severe epigastric pain and vomiting,  which is consistent with acute pancreatitis.  The elevated serum amylase level and γ-glutamyltransferase level support this diagnosis.
 Next,  I need to consider the distribution of the spinal nerves.  The anterior rami of T1-T5 innervate the upper abdomen,  the anterior rami of T6-T10 innervate the lower abdomen and pelvis,  the anterior rami of T11-T12 innervate the lumbar region,  and the posterior rams of T1-T5 innervate the thoracic region.
 Given the location of the pain in the epigastric region,  the nerve that transmits the referred pain to the spinal cord is the anterior rami of T1-T5.

"Input: A 31 -year-old woman with type 2  diabetes mellitus comes to the physician because of an oozing,  foul-smelling wound on her foot for 2  days.  Physical examination shows a 4 -cm,  necrotizing wound with a purplish black discoloration over the heel.  Crepitant bullae producing profuse amounts of serous drainage are seen.  A Gram stain of a tissue biopsy specimen shows gram-positive rods.  The causal organism most likely produces which of the following virulence factors?  Choices: a) Fimbriae b) Pneumolysin c) Polysaccharide capsule d) α-Toxin 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the causal organism based on the Gram stain result.  Gram-positive rods are typically associated with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.  However,  the clinical presentation and physical examination findings suggest a different organism.  The necrotizing wound, purplish black discoloration, crepitant bullae, and profuse serous drainage are characteristic of a Gram-positive bacterium called Staphylococcus aureus.
 Next,  I need to consider the virulence factors produced by Staphylococcus aureus.  Fimbriae are associated with Gram-negative bacteria, not Staphylococcus aureus.  Pneumolysin is produced by Streptococcus pneumoniae.  Polysaccharide capsule is not a virulence factor unique to Staphylococcus aureus.  α-Toxin is a virulence factor produced by Clostridioides difficile, not Staphylococcus aureus.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 23 -year-old woman with bone marrow failure is treated with a large dose of rabbit antithymocyte globulin.  Ten days later,  she develops fever,  lymphadenopathy,  arthralgias,  and erythema on her hands and feet.  Which of the following is the most likely cause of these symptoms?  Choices: a) Cytokine secretion by natural killer cells b) Eosinophil degranulation c) Immune complex deposition in tissues d) Polyclonal T-lymphocyte activation 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms described: fever,  lymphadenopathy,  arthralgias,  and erythema on hands and feet.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the possible causes based on these symptoms.  Fever and lymphadenopathy suggest an inflammatory response,  while arthralgias and erythema suggest vascular involvement.
 Now,  I can eliminate options that do not fit the symptoms:
 a) Cytokine secretion by natural killer cells - This could cause fever and lymphadenopathy,  but not the specific vascular involvement seen in the symptoms.
 b) Eosinophil degranulation - This could cause vascular involvement,  but not the specific inflammatory response seen in the symptoms.
 c) Immune complex deposition in tissues - This could cause both vascular involvement and an inflammatory response,  which fits the symptoms.
 d) Polyclonal T-lymphocyte activation - This could cause an inflammatory response,  but not the specific vascular involvement seen in the symptoms.

Therefore,  the most likely cause of these symptoms is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 68 -year-old man is in the hospital because he requires mechanical ventilation for an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  On the second day after admission he developed a pneumothorax on the right side that required tube thoracostomy.  An air leak is noted for the next 24  hours,  which now has stopped.  However,  the patient has become restless and combative.  Breath sounds are diminished in the right side of the chest and the patient now has tachycardia.  Blood pressure is 130 /80  mm Hg.  After ordering a STAT portable x-ray of the chest,  which of the following is the most appropriate step?  Choices: a) Administer β-blocking medications b) Administer alprazolam c) Remove the patient from the ventilator and ventilate him with a bag-valve mask d) Reposition the chest tube 
 Output:
 First,  I need to assess the situation and determine the cause of the patient's restlessness and tachycardia.  The most likely cause is a tension pneumothorax,  which is a life-threatening condition.
 Next,  I need to stabilize the patient's airway and breathing before addressing other issues.  Removing the patient from the ventilator and ventilating him with a bag-valve mask is not appropriate,  as it could lead to further respiratory compromise.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate step is to reposition the chest tube to ensure that the air leak has stopped and to prevent further respiratory compromise.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 45 -year-old woman with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) comes to the physician because of a 3 -week history of progressive shortness of breath and nonproductive cough.  Her temperature is 36.9 °C (98.4 °F),  pulse is 82 /min,  respirations are 20 /min,  and blood pressure is 136 /85  mm Hg.  Crackles are heard in both lower lung fields.  Pulmonary function tests show total lung capacity is 80 % of predicted,  and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide,  corrected for alveolar volume,  is 65 % of predicted.  Histologic examination of a lung biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings?  Choices: a) Diffuse interstitial fibrosis b) Intra-alveolar exudates c) Multiple thromboemboli d) Necrotizing vasculitis 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation of the patient.  She has systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) and presents with progressive shortness of breath,  nonproductive cough,  and crackles in the lower lung fields.  Pulmonary function tests show reduced total lung capacity and decreased diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide.

Next,  I need to evaluate the choices based on the clinical presentation and pulmonary function tests.  Diffuse interstitial fibrosis can cause reduced lung capacity and decreased diffusing capacity,  which is consistent with the patient's findings.  Intra-alveolar exudates would typically be seen in acute respiratory infections and would not be consistent with the patient's systemic sclerosis.  Multiple thromboemboli would typically present with acute onset of shortness of breath and would not be consistent with the patient's chronic presentation.  Necrotizing vasculitis would typically present with Raynaud's phenomenon and would not be consistent with the patient's pulmonary symptoms.

Therefore,  the most likely histologic finding in a lung biopsy specimen would be diffuse interstitial fibrosis.  So,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: An epidemic involving 10  individuals of all ages occurs in a migrant worker camp.  None of the patients has had any form of immunization.  Most cases present with fever,  chills,  tachypnea,  sore throat,  swollen glands,  and severe malaise.  One patient dies from respiratory complications,  and another dies from myocardial involvement.  A gram-positive rod is isolated from the respiratory tracts of 7  of the patients.  The most likely cause of the outbreak is Choices: a) Bordetella pertussis b) Corynebacterium diphtheriae c) Epstein-Barr virus d) Haemophilus influenzae 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation of the patients,  which includes fever,  chills,  tachypnea,  sore throat,  swollen glands,  and severe malaise.  These symptoms are consistent with a bacterial infection.
 Next,  I need to consider the gram-positive rod isolated from the respiratory tracts of 7  of the patients.  This suggests a bacterium that produces a gram-positive cell wall.
 Among the choices,  Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a gram-positive bacterium that can cause a severe respiratory infection with symptoms similar to those described.  It can also lead to severe complications,  such as respiratory failure and myocardial involvement.
 Therefore,  the most likely cause of the outbreak is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 29 -year-old male presents to the office with the complaints of a pounding heart,  poor sleep,  and a generalized feeling of restlessness.  He relocated 2  months ago to take a promotion and has found himself unable to concentrate on his new duties.  He worries about his ability to adapt to his increase in responsibility at work and states that he has called in sick 3  days within the past 2  weeks.  The most likely diagnosis is Choices: a) adjustment disorder with anxious mood b) generalized anxiety disorder c) major depressive disorder,  single episode,  moderate d) obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the age and context of the patient.  The patient is 29  years old,  which is within the young adult age range.  The context is a relocation for a promotion,  which is a significant life change.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the symptoms presented.  The patient is experiencing a pounding heart,  poor sleep,  and a generalized feeling of restlessness.  These symptoms are consistent with anxiety and stress.
 Then,  I need to consider the duration and severity of the symptoms.  The symptoms have been present for 2  months and have led to the patient calling in sick 3  days within the past 2  weeks.  This indicates a significant impact on the patient's life.
 Finally,  I need to compare the symptoms and context to the diagnostic criteria for each choice.  Adjustment disorder with anxious mood is a mental disorder that occurs within three months of a significant life change and is characterized by emotional or behavioral symptoms that significantly interfere with personal,  family,  work, or school functioning.  The patient's symptoms and context fit this diagnosis.
 Therefore,  the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A new blood test to detect prostate cancer is evaluated in 300  male volunteers.  A needle biopsy of the prostate gland is done on all men with serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations greater than 5  ng/mL (N<4 ).  One hundred men undergo biopsy procedures; 90  are found to have prostate cancer,  and five are found to have chronic prostatitis.  Which of the following is necessary to calculate the sensitivity of this test?  Choices: a) Incidence of chronic prostatitis in the general population b) Number of men with test results greater than 5  ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen c) Prevalence of chronic prostatitis in the general population d) Prostate biopsies of men with test results equal to or below 5  ng/mL 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what sensitivity is.  Sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positive rate).  In this case,  we are looking for the sensitivity of the blood test to detect prostate cancer.
 To calculate sensitivity,  I need to know the number of true positives (men correctly identified with prostate cancer) and the total number of actual cases of prostate cancer (true positives + false negatives).
 In the given information,  we know that 90  men are found to have prostate cancer and five are found to have chronic prostatitis.  So,  the total number of actual cases of prostate cancer is 90  + 5  = 95.
 Now,  I need to find the number of true positives,  which is the same as the number of men found to have prostate cancer by the biopsy.  In this case,  it is 90.
 To calculate sensitivity,  I divide the number of true positives by the total number of actual cases of prostate cancer: 90  ÷ 95  = 0.947.
 Therefore,  the sensitivity of the test is 94.7%.
 The necessary information to calculate the sensitivity is the number of men with test results greater than 5  ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen (choice b).  This is because it represents the false negatives,  which are needed to calculate the true positive rate.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 55 -year-old man who is a business executive is admitted to the hospital for evaluation of abdominal pain.  He is polite to the physician but berates the nurses and other staff.  The patient's wife and two of his three adult children arrive for a visit.  The patient says with disgust that the missing child is and always has been worthless.  Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's behavior?  Choices: a) Projection b) Projective identification c) Reaction formation d) Splitting 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's behavior and the emotions he is expressing.  He is polite to the physician but berates the nurses and other staff,  showing a preference for the physician over the other staff.  He also expresses negative feelings about his missing child,  using words like 'worthless.'
 Next,  I need to consider the psychological terms given as choices and their definitions.  Projection is when a person attributes their own feelings,  beliefs,  or attitudes to others.  Projective identification is when a person transfers their own feelings,  beliefs,  or attitudes to another person.  Reaction formation is when a person expresses the opposite of their true feelings in order to avoid dealing with them.  Splitting is when a person categorizes people or things into good or bad,  with no in-between.
 Comparing the patient's behavior to the definitions,  I can see that he is expressing negative feelings about his child and projecting those feelings onto the nurses and other staff.  This suggests that the patient is using splitting to categorize his child as 'worthless' and to separate him from the positive feelings he has for the physician.
 Therefore,  the most likely explanation for this patient's behavior is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A previously healthy 37 -year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3 -month history of episodes of severe anxiety,  shortness of breath,  palpitations,  and numbness in her hands and feet.  Her vital signs are within normal limits.  Physical examination shows no abnormalities.  Thyroid function studies and an ECG show no abnormalities.  Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?  Choices: a) Lithium carbonate b) Methylphenidate c) Olanzapine d) Paroxetine 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and the diagnostic findings.  The patient presents with severe anxiety,  shortness of breath,  palpitations,  and numbness in her hands and feet,  with no abnormalities found on thyroid function studies and ECG.  These symptoms suggest a possible anxiety disorder,  possibly generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder.
 Next,  I need to consider the pharmacotherapy options.  Lithium carbonate is typically used for bipolar disorder,  not for anxiety disorders.  Methylphenidate is used for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.  Olanzapine is an antipsychotic medication,  not typically used for anxiety disorders.  Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI),  which is commonly used for the treatment of anxiety disorders.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: An investigator is studying the incidence of the common cold among medical students at various time points during the school year.  Results show an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections among these students during finals week.  It is hypothesized that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system,  making the students more susceptible to infection.  Which of the following laboratory findings in these students during examination week is most likely to support this hypothesis?  Choices: a) Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration b) Decreased macrophage activity c) Increased basophil count d) Increased lymphocyte count 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the hypothesis that stress of studying for exams adversely affects the immune system,  making students more susceptible to infection.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the laboratory findings in relation to the immune system.  Decreased cortisol concentration is not likely to support the hypothesis,  as cortisol is a stress hormone that can increase during stress.
 Decreased macrophage activity is also not likely to support the hypothesis,  as macrophages are important immune cells that help fight infections.
 Increased basophil count is not likely to support the hypothesis,  as basophils are involved in allergic reactions and not typically associated with increased susceptibility to infections.
 Increased lymphocyte count is likely to support the hypothesis,  as lymphocytes are a key component of the immune system and an increase in their count would indicate a stronger immune response.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 30 -year-old nulliparous female presents to the office with the complaint of mood changes.  She says that for the past several months she has been anxious,  hyperactive,  and unable to sleep 3  to 4  days prior to the onset of menses.  She further reports that on the day her menses begins she becomes acutely depressed,  anorectic,  irritable,  and lethargic.  She has no psychiatric history.  Physical examination findings are normal.  She and her husband have been trying to conceive for over 2  years.  History reveals a tuboplasty approximately 1  year ago to correct a closed fallopian tube.  The most likely diagnosis is Choices: a) adjustment disorder with depressed mood b) bipolar I disorder,  mixed c) cyclothymic personality d) generalized anxiety disorder 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's symptoms and their onset.  The patient reports mood changes,  anxiety,  hyperactivity,  and sleep disturbances in the days leading up to menstruation,  and depression,  anorexia,  irritability,  and lethargy at the onset of menstruation.  These symptoms suggest a hormonal influence on mood.
 Next,  I need to consider the patient's history.  She has a history of a tuboplasty,  which could potentially affect her menstrual cycle and hormone levels.
 Finally,  I need to consider the differential diagnoses.  Adjustment disorder with depressed mood could be a possibility,  but the symptoms are not related to a specific stressor.  Bipolar I disorder,  mixed could be a possibility,  but the patient does not have a prior history of mood episodes.  Cyclothymic personality is less likely,  as the patient does not have a consistent history of mood swings.  Generalized anxiety disorder could be a possibility,  but the patient's symptoms are more severe and include mood changes and sleep disturbances.
 Based on the patient's symptoms,  history,  and differential diagnoses,  the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 19 -year-old college student comes to the physician because of vaginal irritation and pain with urination for 5  days.  Two weeks ago,  she had streptococcal pharyngitis treated with amoxicillin.  She has been sexually active with two partners over the past year; she uses condoms for contraception.  Her last menstrual period was 1  week ago.  Her temperature is 37.2 °C (99 °F),  and blood pressure is 90 /60  mm Hg.  Pelvic examination shows erythema of the vulva and vagina and a thick white vaginal discharge.  The pH of the discharge is 4.  Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?  Choices: a) Bacterial vaginosis b) Candidiasis c) Chlamydia trachomatis infection d) Escherichia coli infection 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and the patient's history.  The patient has vaginal irritation,  pain with urination,  and a thick white vaginal discharge.  The pH of the discharge is 4,  which is within the normal range for bacterial vaginosis (3.5-4.5).  However,  the patient has a history of recent streptococcal pharyngitis treated with amoxicillin,  which could have led to a reaction or side effect.
 Next,  I need to consider the potential causes of the symptoms.  Bacterial vaginosis is a possibility,  but the symptoms are not very specific for this condition.  Candidiasis could also be a cause,  but the pH of the discharge is within the normal range for candidiasis (3.0-4.5).  Chlamydia trachomatis infection is a sexually transmitted infection that could cause these symptoms,  but the patient's history of using condoms for contraception makes this less likely.  Escherichia coli infection is another possibility,  especially since the patient has had recent antibiotic use,  which could have disrupted the normal flora of the vagina.
 To determine the most likely cause,  I need to consider the patient's history and the specificity of the symptoms.  The patient's recent antibiotic use and the normal pH of the discharge make Escherichia coli infection the most likely cause of these findings.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A sexually active 23 -year-old man with multiple sex partners has dysuria and a yellow urethral exudate.  Gram stain of the exudate shows numerous neutrophils,  many that contain intracellular gram-negative diplococci.  He has had three similar episodes of urethritis over the past 2  years.  Which of the following properties of the infecting organism best explains the reinfection?  Choices: a) Antigenic variation b) Catalase c) Inhibition of B-lymphocyte function d) Inhibition of T-lymphocyte function 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the infecting organism.  The presence of neutrophils containing intracellular gram-negative diplococci suggests Neisseria gonorrhoeae,  a common cause of urethritis.
 Next,  I need to consider the properties of the organism that could lead to reinfection.  Antigenic variation allows the organism to evade the host's immune response,  making it easier for the organism to reinfect the host.
 Therefore,  the best explanation for the reinfection is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 54 -year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of severe jaw pain since undergoing a painful dental procedure 1  day ago.  The patient was prescribed codeine after the procedure and instructed to take the medication every 4  hours,  but she has continued pain despite adherence to this analgesic regimen.  Other members of her family also have experienced poor pain control with codeine.  Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this therapeutic failure?  Choices: a) Decreased absorption of codeine b) Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine c) Deficiency of κ receptors d) Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and family history of poor pain control with codeine.  This suggests that the patient may have a genetic predisposition to poor codeine metabolism.
 Next,  I need to consider the options provided.  Option a) Decreased absorption of codeine,  could be a possible explanation,  but it is less likely because the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen.
 Option b) Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine,  is a strong candidate because it could explain the patient's poor pain control due to genetic factors.
 Option c) Deficiency of κ receptors,  could be a possible explanation,  but it is less likely because the patient has severe jaw pain,  which suggests that the opioid receptors are functioning to some extent.
 Option d) Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine,  is less likely because it would not explain the patient's family history of poor pain control with codeine.

Therefore,  the most likely explanation for this therapeutic failure is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A healthy 4 -year-old girl is brought for a well-child examination.  A grade 2 /6  systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper left sternal border.  S2  is widely split and does not vary with respiration.  A soft mid-diastolic murmur is heard along the lower left sternal border.  Examination shows no other abnormalities.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  Choices: a) Aortic stenosis b) Atrial septal defect c) Coarctation of the aorta d) Mitral valve prolapse 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation and the findings on physical examination.  A grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border suggests aortic stenosis,  as the aortic valve is the most likely source of such a murmur.  Additionally,  the S2  splitting and lack of variation with respiration do not support atrial septal defect.
 Next,  the soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border is less suggestive of aortic stenosis and more consistent with aortic insufficiency,  which is not mentioned as an option.
 Finally,  the absence of other abnormalities supports the diagnosis of aortic stenosis.
 Therefore,  the most likely diagnosis is aortic stenosis,  which corresponds to {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 75 -year-old woman comes to the office because she has band-like,  burning pain in her right upper abdomen extending from the epigastrium around to the midline of the back.  Physical examination discloses no abdominal tenderness to palpation.  Findings on ultrasonography of the gallbladder are normal.  Serum amylase concentration is within the reference range.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  Choices: a) Acalculous cholecystitis b) Chronic relapsing pancreatitis c) Diverticulitis of the cecum d) Herpes zoster 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and physical examination findings.  The patient presents with band-like,  burning pain in the right upper abdomen,  which extends from the epigastrium around to the midline of the back.  Physical examination discloses no abdominal tenderness to palpation.  This suggests that the pain is not due to inflammation of the gallbladder or inflammation of the pancreas,  as these conditions typically cause tenderness in the abdomen.

Next,  I need to consider the imaging findings.  Ultrasonography of the gallbladder is normal,  which further supports the idea that the pain is not due to inflammation of the gallbladder.  Additionally,  the serum amylase concentration is within the reference range,  which suggests that there is no acute pancreatitis.

Finally,  I need to consider the remaining options.  Diverticulitis of the cecum typically causes sudden onset of pain,  fever,  and tenderness in the lower right abdomen.  Herpes zoster can cause band-like pain,  but it is usually associated with a rash and is not typically located in the upper abdomen.

Based on the information provided,  achecalculous cholecystitis is the most likely diagnosis,  as it can cause band-like pain in the upper abdomen without tenderness and is not associated with inflammation of the gallbladder or acute pancreatitis.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 36 -year-old man comes to the office because of headaches that began 2  weeks ago.  The headaches are moderately severe,  are present when he awakens in the morning,  and are relieved with over-the-counter analgesics.  He has no prior history of headaches.  He tells you he was promoted to an upper-level managerial position in his accounting firm about 8  months ago,  which necessitated relocating.  Physical examination now discloses no abnormalities except for blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?  Choices: a) Begin a trial of a β-blocking medication b) Order CT scan of the head c) Order EEG d) Refer him for consultation with a neurologist 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and symptoms.  The headaches started 2  weeks ago,  are moderately severe,  and are relieved by over-the-counter analgesics.  He has no prior history of headaches.  His recent stressor is the promotion to a managerial position and relocation.  The physical examination reveals blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally,  which could indicate increased intracranial pressure.

Next,  I need to determine the most appropriate next step in managing the patient's condition.  The options are:

a) Begin a trial of a β-blocking medication: This could be appropriate if the patient has migraines or tension headaches,  but the blurring of the optic disc margins suggests a more serious condition that may require further evaluation.

b) Order CT scan of the head: This is a reasonable next step to determine if there is any structural abnormality in the head that could be causing the increased intracranial pressure.

c) Order EEG: This test is typically used to evaluate for epilepsy,  and the patient's symptoms do not suggest epilepsy.

d) Refer him for consultation with a neurologist: This could be appropriate,  but it is not the first step,  as a CT scan may provide more immediate information about the cause of the increased intracranial pressure.

Considering the information available,  the most appropriate next step is to order a CT scan of the head to determine if there is any structural abnormality causing the increased intracranial pressure.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 15 -year-old girl comes to the physician because of a 3 -month history of acne.  Breast and pubic hair development began at the age of 12  years.  Menarche occurred at the age of 14  years.  Physical examination shows scattered open and closed comedones over the cheeks and forehead.  Breast and pubic hair development are Tanner stage 5.  Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's acne?  Choices: a) Increased estrogen stimulation of the sebaceous glands b) Increased responsiveness of the sebaceous glands to follicle-stimulating hormone c) Increased sympathetic stimulation to the sebaceous glands d) Stimulation of the sebaceous glands by androgens 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's age and the timing of the development of breast and pubic hair.  The patient is 15  years old and has breast and pubic hair development that began at the age of 12 .  This suggests that the patient is in the early stages of puberty.
 Next,  I need to consider the physical examination findings.  The patient has scattered open and closed comedones over the cheeks and forehead,  which is consistent with acne.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  The most likely underlying cause of acne in this patient is related to the patient's pubertal development and the presence of androgens.  Androgens are male sex hormones that are present in both males and females,  but they are more abundant in males.  During puberty,  the levels of androgens increase,  which can stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil,  leading to the formation of acne.
 Therefore,  the most likely underlying cause of this patient's acne is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 19 -year-old Asian female college student comes to the university health center because of a 1 -week history of nasal stuffiness,  occasional clear rhinorrhea,  and a mild sore throat.  Two days ago,  she began to feel hot,  but she has not taken her temperature.  Medical history is unremarkable and her only medication is an oral contraceptive.  She has no history of allergies.  She does not smoke cigarettes.  BMI is 22  kg/m2  .  Vital signs are temperature 38.1 °C (100.6 °F),  pulse 88 /min,  respirations 16 /min,  and blood pressure 116 /74  mm Hg.  Physical examination discloses tenderness over the left maxillary sinus without purulent drainage.  There is clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane,  enlarged tonsils bilaterally,  and pain with tapping of the left upper incisors.  Left frontal sinus does not transilluminate.  Cardiopulmonary examination discloses no abnormalities.  Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's sinusitis?  Choices: a) Eustachian tube dysfunction b) Mucosal edema c) Nasal polyps d) Oral contraceptive use 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.  The patient has nasal stuffiness,  clear rhinorrhea,  sore throat,  and fever.  Physical examination shows tenderness over the left maxillary sinus,  clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane,  enlarged tonsils bilaterally,  and pain with tapping of the left upper incisors.  The left frontal sinus does not transilluminate.  These findings suggest a bacterial infection of the sinuses.
 Next,  I need to consider the possible underlying mechanisms of sinusitis.  Eustachian tube dysfunction can lead to middle ear infection,  but it is not the most likely cause in this case,  as the patient has clear fluid behind the tympanic membrane,  which indicates a more localized infection.  Mucosal edema and nasal polyps are more common in allergic rhinitis,  but the patient has no history of allergies.  Oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increased risk of bacterial sinusitis,  due to its effect on the endothelium and vascular permeability.
 Therefore,  the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's sinusitis is d) Oral contraceptive use.

"Input: A randomized controlled trial is conducted to assess the effectiveness of a new combination-drug antihypertensive therapy (Drug X) compared with a standard antihypertensive single-drug therapy.  Study participants include 140  women (70 %) and 60  men (30 %) ages 30  to 60  years,  with baseline blood pressure measurements of 150 /95  mm Hg or higher.  The investigators defined antihypertensive therapy as effective if the treatment resulted in a blood pressure measurement below 140 /90  mm Hg.  When designing the study,  the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1 %; they set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10 %.  Which of the following is the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study?  Choices: a) 1 % b) 10 % c) 40 % d) 90 % 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of statistical power.  Statistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false,  in other words,  the ability to detect an effect if there is one.  In this case,  the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1 %,  which means the significance level (alpha) is 1 %.  They also set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10 %,  which means the beta (1-power) is 10 %.
 To find the power,  I can rearrange the formula: power = 1 - beta.
 So,  the power in this study is 1 - 10 % = 90 %.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

The patient has a history of anterior myocardial infarction,  shortness of breath with mild exertion,  smoking,  and current medications including labetalol and daily aspirin.  Physical examination shows jugular venous pulsations,  crackles at both lung bases,  an S3  gallop,  and ankle swelling.

Second,  I need to identify the most likely diagnosis based on these findings.  The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF).  CHF is a common complication of myocardial infarction and is often associated with left ventricular dysfunction.

Third,  I need to evaluate the choices given and determine which finding is most likely in a patient with CHF.  a) Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is not typical in CHF,  as pulmonary edema is common in CHF and would increase pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.  b) Impaired contractility of the left ventricle is consistent with the patient's history of myocardial infarction and is a common finding in CHF.  c) Prolapse of the mitral valve is a possible finding in CHF,  but it is not the most likely based on the information provided.  d) Thrombosis of the superior vena cava is less common in CHF and is not mentioned as a likely finding based on the information provided.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 47 -year-old woman comes to the physician because of persistent nonproductive cough for 6  weeks.  She has not had fever or weight loss.  She has hypertension treated with enalapril for the past 3  months.  She does not smoke.  There is no history of lung disease.  She weighs 54  kg (120  lb) and is 163  cm (64  in) tall.  Her temperature is 37 °C (98.6 °F),  blood pressure is 130 /80  mm Hg,  pulse is 70 /min,  and respirations are 12 /min.  Examination and an x-ray of the chest show no abnormalities.  Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of this patient's cough?  Choices: a) Decreased plasma renin activity b) Decreased serum angiotensin II concentrations c) Increased serum angiotensin I concentrations d) Increased serum bradykinin concentrations 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and symptoms.  The patient is a 47 -year-old woman with a persistent nonproductive cough for 6  weeks,  no fever or weight loss,  hypertension treated with enalapril,  and no history of lung disease.  Examination and chest x-ray show no abnormalities.
 Enalapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used to treat hypertension.  It works by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II,  a potent vasoconstrictor.
 Next,  I need to consider the possible mechanisms for the patient's cough based on the given choices.  a) Decreased plasma renin activity is a result of enalapril,  but it is not directly related to the cough.  b) Decreased serum angiotensin II concentrations is the direct effect of enalapril,  but it is not a cause of cough.  c) Increased serum angiotensin I concentrations is not a direct effect of enalapril and is not a cause of cough.  d) Increased serum bradykinin concentrations is a secondary effect of enalapril,  as it leads to the release of bradykinin,  a substance that can cause cough.
 Therefore,  the most likely mechanism of this patient's cough is increased serum bradykinin concentrations.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 6 -year-old boy is brought to the emergency department 2  hours after injuring his arm when he fell out of a tree.  His mother says that he is extremely active and likes to climb.  During the past year,  he fractured his right tibia after falling off a trampoline and sustained a concussion after falling off his bicycle.  She says that his teachers reprimand him frequently for running wildly in the classroom,  talking excessively,  and getting out of his seat; he often forgets to turn in his homework.  His parents are currently divorcing.  His father has a history of illicit drug use.  The patient is at the 50 th percentile for height and weight.  His pulse is 80 /min,  and blood pressure is 100 /80  mm Hg.  Physical examination shows a dislocated left shoulder,  healing abrasions over the elbows,  and ecchymoses in various stages of healing over the knees.  Mental status examination shows a neutral affect.  He says that he likes to run and climb trees.  Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?  Choices: a) Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder b) Conduct disorder c) Learning disorder d) Seizure disorder 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and physical examination findings.  The patient has a history of frequent falls and injuries,  as well as a history of his father's illicit drug use.  His behavior at school includes running wildly, talking excessively,  and getting out of his seat,  which are consistent with symptoms of a behavioral disorder.  His physical examination findings show a dislocated left shoulder,  healing abrasions over the elbows,  and ecchymoses in various stages of healing over the knees,  which suggest a history of falls.  The mental status examination shows a neutral affect,  but the patient admits to liking to run and climb trees,  which are consistent with his history of falls and injuries.

Based on these findings,  the most likely explanation for the patient's behavior and history of falls is a behavioral disorder.  Out of the given choices,  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder are the most relevant.  ADHD is characterized by inattention,  impulsivity,  and hyperactivity,  while conduct disorder is characterized by a repetitive pattern of behavior that violates social norms or basic rights of others.  The patient's behavior at school,  such as running wildly and talking excessively,  is more consistent with the symptoms of ADHD.

Therefore,  the most likely explanation for these findings is attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.  The output is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 49 -year-old man,  who is recovering in the hospital 2  days after uncomplicated left femoral-popliteal bypass grafting for claudication,  has now developed increasing pain in his left foot.  Until now,  the patient's postoperative course had been unremarkable and he has been treated with low-dose morphine for pain control.  Medical history is remarkable for type 2  diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin and diet.  Vital signs now are temperature 36.8 °C (98.2 °F),  pulse 80 /min and regular,  respirations 20 /min,  and blood pressure 150 /92  mm Hg.  The surgical incision appears clean and well approximated without abnormal erythema or swelling.  The left lower extremity and foot appear pale.  Palpation of the left lower extremity discloses a strong femoral pulse,  a weak popliteal pulse,  and a cool,  pulseless foot.  Which of the following is the most appropriate management?  Choices: a) Bedside compartment pressure measurements b) Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity c) Intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy d) Intraoperative angiography 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the potential cause of the patient's symptoms.  The patient has developed increasing pain in his left foot after a left femoral-popliteal bypass grafting,  and the foot is cool,  pulseless,  and pale,  which are signs of ischemia.
 Next,  I need to determine the appropriate management for this condition.  The options are bedside compartment pressure measurements,  doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity,  intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy,  and intraoperative angiography.
 Considering the situation,  the most appropriate management is to first use Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity to assess the blood flow in the bypass graft and identify any thrombosis or other issues causing the ischemia.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 9 -year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive weakness and a purple-red discoloration over his cheeks and upper eyelids over the past 8  weeks.  His symptoms began shortly after a camping trip,  and he now is unable to climb stairs,  walk long distances,  comb his hair,  or dress himself.  His mother says that she was careful to apply his sunscreen on the trip and can recall no tick bites or exposure to poisonous plants.  His only medication is a topical corticosteroid for several dry,  scaly patches of the skin.  He appears weak and lethargic.  He is at the 75 th percentile for height and 25 th percentile for weight; he has had no change in his weight since his last examination 9  months ago.  His temperature is 37.7 °C (99.8 °F),  blood pressure is 110 /68  mm Hg,  pulse is 105 /min,  and respirations are 28 /min.  Examination of the skin shows a purple-red discoloration over the cheeks and eyelids,  periorbital edema,  erythematous plaques and scales over the elbows and knees,  and flat-topped red papules over all knuckles.  There is generalized weakness and atrophy of the proximal muscles.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  Choices: a) Dermatomyositis b) Duchenne's muscular dystrophy c) Eczema d) Lyme disease 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and physical examination findings.  The purple-red discoloration over the cheeks and upper eyelids is a key feature.  The progressive weakness and muscle atrophy are also important.  The absence of tick bites or exposure to poisonous plants and the use of topical corticosteroid are relevant.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the diagnostic options.  Dermatomyositis is characterized by the triad of periorbital rash, muscle weakness, and skin changes.  Duchenne's muscular dystrophy is a progressive muscle disease but does not typically present with the periorbital rash.  Eczema is a skin condition but does not cause muscle weakness or the specific skin changes described.  Lyme disease is caused by a tick bite and presents with a bull's-eye rash, but the patient denies tick bites.
 Based on the symptoms and physical examination findings,  the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A sexually active 20 -year-old woman has had fever,  chills,  malaise,  and pain of the vulva for 2  days.  Examination shows a vulvar pustule that has ulcerated and formed multiple satellite lesions.  Nodes are palpated in the inguinal and femoral areas.  A smear of fluid from the lesions establishes the diagnosis.  Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?  Choices: a) Chlamydia trachomatis b) Haemophilus ducreyi c) Neisseria gonorrhoeae d) Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation and the findings on examination.  The patient has a sexually transmitted disease with symptoms of fever,  chills,  malaise,  and pain of the vulva,  along with a vulvar pustule that has ulcerated and formed multiple satellite lesions.  Nodes are palpated in the inguinal and femoral areas.
 Next,  I need to consider the diagnostic method used,  which is a smear of fluid from the lesions.  This is a common method for diagnosing chancroid,  a sexually transmitted disease caused by Haemophilus ducreyi.
 Therefore,  the most likely causal organism is Haemophilus ducreyi,  which corresponds to choice b).

"Input: A 64 -year-old man with non-Hodgkin lymphoma comes to the physician because of a 3 -week history of progressive numbness in his hands and feet and weakness in his legs when he stands.  He received his third course of chemotherapy 4  weeks ago.  Physical examination shows areflexia.  Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these adverse effects?  Choices: a) Doxorubicin b) Fluorouracil c) Methotrexate d) Vincristine 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and the timing of the symptoms.  The patient is experiencing progressive numbness in his hands and feet and weakness in his legs,  which is consistent with peripheral neuropathy.  The symptoms started 4  weeks after the third course of chemotherapy,  which suggests that the chemotherapy drug is the cause.
 Next,  I need to consider the side effects of each chemotherapy drug.  Doxorubicin is known to cause cardiotoxicity and skin rash,  but not peripheral neuropathy.  Fluorouracil is known to cause diarrhea,  but not peripheral neuropathy.  Methotrexate is known to cause bone marrow suppression and hepatotoxicity,  but not peripheral neuropathy.  Vincristine is known to cause peripheral neuropathy and skin rash,  and it has a half-life of about 12  hours,  which is short enough to cause symptoms soon after administration.
 Based on the side effects of each drug and the timing of the symptoms,  the most likely cause of the patient's adverse effects is Vincristine.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 52 -year-old man comes to the physician with his wife because of a 1 -year history of excessive daytime sleepiness.  He does not think the symptoms are problematic,  but his wife is concerned because he sometimes falls asleep on the sofa early in the evening when guests are present.  He also once fell asleep while driving at night and drove off the road,  narrowly avoiding injury.  His wife says that he has always snored loudly,  and over the past year,  he has had episodes of choking or gasping for breath while sleeping.  He is 178  cm (5  ft 10  in) tall and weighs 105  kg (231  lb); BMI is 33  kg/m2  .  His pulse is 76 /min,  respirations are 14 /min,  and blood pressure is 150 /76  mm Hg.  Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities.  Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?  Choices: a) 24 -Hour ambulatory ECG monitoring b) Multiple sleep latency test c) Polysomnography d) CT scan of the head 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the most likely diagnosis based on the symptoms.  The patient has a history of excessive daytime sleepiness,  loud snoring,  and episodes of choking or gasping for breath while sleeping.  These symptoms are consistent with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
 Next,  I need to determine which test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis of OSA.  Among the choices,  polysomnography is the gold standard for diagnosing OSA,  as it provides detailed information about sleep architecture,  airway obstruction,  and respiratory events.
 Therefore,  the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 47 -year-old man is brought to the emergency department 2  hours after the sudden onset of shortness of breath,  severe chest pain,  and sweating.  He has no history of similar symptoms.  He has hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide.  He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30  years.  His pulse is 110 /min,  respirations are 24 /min,  and blood pressure is 110 /50  mm Hg.  A grade 3 /6,  diastolic blowing murmur is heard over the left sternal border and radiates to the right sternal border.  Femoral pulses are decreased bilaterally.  An ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  Choices: a) Acute myocardial infarction b) Aortic dissection c) Esophageal rupture d) Mitral valve prolapse 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and physical findings.  The patient presents with sudden onset of shortness of breath,  severe chest pain,  and sweating,  which are classic signs of a cardiovascular emergency.  The grade 3/6 diastolic blowing murmur over the left sternal border,  radiating to the right sternal border,  and decreased femoral pulses bilaterally suggest aortic pathology.  The ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy,  which can be related to hypertension or other causes.

Next,  I need to consider the risk factors.  The patient is a 47 -year-old man with a history of smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for 30  years,  which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.  He has hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide,  which is a common medication for hypertension.

Finally,  I need to evaluate the options.  a) Acute myocardial infarction is a possibility,  but the ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy rather than ST-segment elevation or depression,  which are more typical of an acute myocardial infarction.  b) Aortic dissection is a strong consideration due to the aortic-related symptoms and physical findings.  c) Esophageal rupture is less likely,  as the symptoms and physical findings do not align well with this diagnosis.  d) Mitral valve prolapse is less likely,  as the symptoms and physical findings do not suggest mitral valve pathology.

Based on the symptoms,  physical findings,  and risk factors,  the most likely diagnosis is aortic dissection.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

"Input: A 26 -year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of an 8 -hour history of severe back and abdominal pain and mild but persistent vaginal bleeding.  Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows a 2 -cm ectopic pregnancy in the ampulla.  The ampulla has ruptured into the surrounding tissue.  Fluid from this rupture will most likely be found in which of the following locations?  Choices: a) Lesser peritoneal cavity b) Mesometrium c) Pouch of Douglas d) Uterine cavity 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the anatomy of the fallopian tube.  The ampulla is a part of the fallopian tube where fertilization typically occurs.  If an ectopic pregnancy occurs in the ampulla,  it can rupture and spill into the surrounding tissue.
 Next,  I need to consider the possible locations where the ruptured fluid can be found.  The lesser peritoneal cavity is the potential space where the spillage could occur,  as it is the abdominal cavity.  The mesometrium is the outer fibrous layer of the uterus,  which is not a likely location for the spillage.  The pouch of Douglas is a pelvic space located between the uterus and the rectouterine cul-de-sac,  which is also a potential location for the spillage.  The uterine cavity is where a normal pregnancy develops,  and it is not a likely location for the spillage from an ectopic pregnancy in the ampulla.
 To determine the most likely location,  I consider the proximity of the ampulla to the potential spaces.  The ampulla is located in the pelvic cavity,  close to the pouch of Douglas.  Therefore,  the fluid from the ruptured ampulla is most likely to be found in the pouch of Douglas.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.  The patient has a 2 -month history of fatigue,  generalized aching and weakness of the proximal muscles of all four extremities,  and cracking of the skin of both hands.  The weakness has progressed,  and the patient now has difficulty combing her hair.  She also has achy joints in her hands that respond partially to ibuprofen.  The laboratory results show elevated creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase concentrations.

Next,  I need to evaluate each of the choices based on the patient's presentation.  Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, but the patient's symptoms are more specific to muscle weakness and skin changes.  Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that causes muscle weakness, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a muscle disease rather than a neuromuscular junction disorder.  Polymyositis is an inflammatory muscle disease that can cause muscle weakness, skin changes, and elevated muscle enzyme levels, which fits the patient's presentation well.  Scleroderma is a connective tissue disorder that can cause skin changes, but the patient's symptoms are not consistent with the typical manifestations of scleroderma.

Therefore,  the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 16 -year-old male is brought to the emergency department with sudden-onset swelling of the right knee.  He denies any trauma.  Past medical history reveals cystic fibrosis.  Examination of the knee reveals fluctuance on palpation of the joint but no increased warmth; mild restriction in range of motion due to the swelling is also noted.  Numerous bruises are noted in various stages of resolution.  Further history reveals easy bruising and bleeding from the gums over the past month.  The most likely explanation for these findings is Choices: a) acquired factor VIII deficiency b) diffuse intravascular coagulation secondary to infection c) hypocomplementemia d) malabsorption of vitamins A,  D,  E,  and K 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's age,  which is 16  years old,  and his medical history,  which includes cystic fibrosis.  Cystic fibrosis is known to cause pancreatic insufficiency,  which can lead to malabsorption of vitamins A,  D,  E,  and K.  This can result in easy bruising and bleeding from the gums,  as well as joint swelling due to the accumulation of these vitamins in the body.
 Next,  I need to consider the physical examination findings,  such as fluctuance on palpation of the joint and mild restriction in range of motion due to swelling.  These findings are consistent with the accumulation of vitamins in the joint.
 Finally,  I need to consider the history of easy bruising and bleeding from the gums over the past month,  which is also consistent with malabsorption of vitamins A,  D,  E,  and K.

"Input: A 65 -year-old man who is quadriplegic as a result of multiple sclerosis is hospitalized for treatment of left lower lobe pneumonia.  His temperature is 38.1 °C (100.5 °F),  pulse is 95 /min,  respirations are 12 /min,  and blood pressure is 120 /80  mm Hg.  He appears malnourished.  Rhonchi are heard at the left lower lobe of the lung on auscultation.  Examination of the heart,  lymph nodes,  abdomen,  and extremities shows no abnormalities.  There is a 1 -cm area of erythema over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration.  Neurologic examination shows quadriparesis.  Test of the stool for occult blood is negative.  Which of the following is the most effective intervention for this patient's skin lesion?  Choices: a) Frequent turning b) Use of wet to dry dressings c) Whirlpool therapy d) Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the type of skin lesion.  The description of a 1 -cm area of erythema over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration suggests a pressure ulcer.
 Next,  I need to determine the most effective intervention for pressure ulcers.  There are several interventions,  but the most effective one for pressure ulcers is to reduce pressure on the affected area.
 Among the choices,  frequent turning (a) and use of wet to dry dressings (b) are both methods to reduce pressure on the affected area.  Whirlpool therapy (c) is not typically used for pressure ulcers.  Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (d) is not the most effective intervention for pressure ulcers,  as antibiotics are not typically used for pressure ulcers.
 Therefore,  the most effective interventions for this patient's skin lesion are {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 25 -year-old woman who is 19  weeks pregnant comes to the office for a prenatal examination.  Her father had classic hemophilia.  A karyotype obtained from an amniotic fluid sample of the patient shows that the fetus is XY.  Which of the following should you tell the patient regarding her infant?  Choices: a) The infant will neither have hemophilia nor be a carrier b) The infant has a 50 % risk for hemophilia c) The infant has a 50 % risk for being a carrier d) The infant has a 75 % risk for hemophilia 
 Output:
 First,  we need to consider the inheritance of hemophilia.  Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder,  meaning that males can be born with hemophilia if their mother is a carrier,  but females can only be affected if they inherit two copies of the mutated X chromosome,  one from each parent.
 Since the woman is 19  weeks pregnant,  she is still early in her pregnancy,  and the amniotic fluid sample provides genetic information about the fetus.  The karyotype shows that the fetus is XY,  meaning it is male.
 The woman's father had classic hemophilia,  which means he had the genotype X'Y (where X' represents the mutated X chromosome).  Since he is the woman's father,  she must have inherited the mutated X chromosome from him,  giving her the genotype XX'.
 Now,  we need to consider the possible genotypes of the fetus.  Since the fetus is male,  it can only inherit an X or a Y chromosome from the mother.  The mother has the genotype XX',  so there is a 50 % chance that the fetus will inherit the mutated X chromosome (XX') and be a carrier,  and a 50 % chance that the fetus will inherit a normal X chromosome (XY) and neither have hemophilia nor be a carrier.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 20 -year-old female presents to the emergency department with a 2 -day history of nausea and vomiting.  She says that today she noticed a slight amount of blood in her vomit.

Which of the following is the most appropriate initial test to order?  Choices: a) abdominal flat plate radiography b) amylase level c) complete blood count d) urine pregnancy test 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms presented by the patient.  The patient has a 2 -day history of nausea and vomiting,  and today she noticed a slight amount of blood in her vomit.  These symptoms are suggestive of gastrointestinal bleeding.
 Next,  I need to consider the possible causes of gastrointestinal bleeding.  Common causes include peptic ulcer disease,  gallstones,  and gastroenteritis.
 Now,  I need to consider the most appropriate initial test to order.  The most appropriate initial test to order is an amylase level,  as it can help differentiate between gastroenteritis (high amylase) and peptic ulcer disease (low amylase).
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 60 -year-old man had a total thyroidectomy and excision of enlarged left jugular lymph nodes for follicular carcinoma.  The operation was uncomplicated.  He is receiving intravenous 5 % dextrose and 0.45 % saline with potassium.  Twelve hours after the operation he develops circumoral numbness and paresthesias in his fingertips,  and he becomes very anxious.  Vital signs are temperature 37.6 °C (99.7 °F),  pulse 90 /min,  respirations 16 /min,  and blood pressure 140 /90  mm Hg.  Physical examination discloses a dry neck dressing and no stridor.  Extremities are warm,  with brisk capillary refill time.  Additional physical examination is most likely to show which of the following?  Choices: a) Babinski sign present bilaterally b) Chvostek sign c) Deviation of the tongue to the left side d) A drooping left shoulder 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and the operation.  The patient developed numbness,  paresthesias,  and anxiety 12  hours after the total thyroidectomy.  These symptoms suggest a potential issue with the surgical procedure or the medications used.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  a) Babinski sign present bilaterally is a sign of a neurological problem,  but it is not specific to thyroid surgery or the presented symptoms.  b) Chvostek sign is a sign of hypocalcemia,  which can occur after thyroidectomy due to the removal of the parathyroid glands.  c) Deviation of the tongue to the left side could indicate a problem with the left side of the brain,  but it is not specific to thyroid surgery or the presented symptoms.  d) A drooping left shoulder could be a sign of weakness on the left side,  which could be related to hypocalcemia or other postoperative complications.
 Therefore,  the most likely finding in the additional physical examination is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: In a cohort study of elderly women,  the relative risk ratio for hip fractures among those who exercise regularly is 1.2  (95 % confidence interval of 1.1  to 1.8 ).  Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion about the effect of regular exercise on the risk for hip fracture?  Choices: a) Statistically nonsignificant increase in risk b) Statistically nonsignificant overall decrease in risk c) Statistically significant overall decrease in risk d) Statistically significant overall increase in risk 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the relative risk ratio and its confidence interval.  The relative risk ratio is 1.2,  which means that regular exercisers have a 20% higher risk of hip fractures compared to non-exercisers.
 Next,  I need to consider the 95% confidence interval,  which is 1.1 to 1.8.  This interval includes values greater than 1,  indicating that the risk is higher for regular exercisers.
 Since the confidence interval does not include 1,  it means that the effect is statistically significant.

"Input: A 33 -year-old man undergoes a radical thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer.  During the operation,  moderate hemorrhaging requires ligation of several vessels in the left side of the neck.  Postoperatively,  serum studies show a calcium concentration of 7.5  mg/dL,  albumin concentration of 4  g/dL,  and parathyroid hormone concentration of 200  pg/mL.  Damage to which of the following vessels caused the findings in this patient?  Choices: a) Branch of the costocervical trunk b) Branch of the external carotid artery c) Branch of the thyrocervical trunk d) Tributary of the internal jugular vein 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the vessel that was likely damaged during the operation.  The patient experienced moderate hemorrhaging,  which suggests damage to a blood vessel.  The options given are: a) Branch of the costocervical trunk b) Branch of the external carotid artery c) Branch of the thyrocervical trunk d) Tributary of the internal jugular vein.

Next,  I need to consider the clinical findings.  The patient's serum studies show a low calcium concentration (7.5  mg/dL),  which is suggestive of hypocalcemia.  Hypocalcemia can be caused by damage to the thyroid gland,  parathyroid glands,  or blood vessels.  The parathyroid hormone concentration is within the normal range (200  pg/mL),  which suggests that the parathyroid glands were not significantly damaged.

The most likely cause of the hypocalcemia in this patient is damage to a blood vessel that supplies the thyroid gland.  The thyrocervical trunk is one of the main blood vessels that supply the thyroid gland,  so damage to a branch of the thyrocervical trunk could cause the observed hemorrhaging and hypocalcemia.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 44 -year-old woman with a 10 -year history of arthritis comes to the office because she has had increasing pain and stiffness in her hands,  wrists,  and knees during the past several months.  She also has had increasing fatigue for the past month,  along with a weight loss of 1.8  to 2.2  kg (4  to 5  lb).  She has seen numerous physicians for her arthritis in the past and has tried various medications and devices,  including copper bracelets from Mexico given to her by friends.  Review of her medical records confirms that the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is correct.  She says,  ""I had several drop attacks during the past 3  months. "" She characterizes these attacks as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes.  During one of these episodes,  she became incontinent.  She currently takes aspirin approximately four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally.  Physical examination shows facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints,  bilaterally.  There is moderate ulnar deviation of the fingers.  The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities.  Which of the following is the most likely cause of her ""drop attacks? "" Choices: a) Adrenal insufficiency b) Anxiety c) Atlanto-axial instability d) Cardiac arrhythmia 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and physical examination findings.  The patient has a long history of arthritis,  with increasing pain and stiffness in her hands,  wrists,  and knees.  She also has fatigue and weight loss.  The physical examination shows swollen and painful joints,  ulnar deviation of the fingers,  and facial plethora,  which are suggestive of systemic disease.  The diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is confirmed.
 The patient's ""drop attacks"" are described as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes,  and one episode resulted in incontinence.  These symptoms are more suggestive of a neurological cause.
 Next,  I need to consider the possible causes of neurological symptoms in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.  Adrenal insufficiency can cause weakness and fatigue,  but it is less likely to cause loss of feeling in the legs and incontinence.  Anxiety can cause symptoms like these,  but it is not typically associated with swollen joints or ulnar deviation.  Atlanto-axial instability can cause weakness and loss of feeling in the limbs,  but it is not typically associated with rheumatoid arthritis.  Cardiac arrhythmia can cause weakness and loss of feeling in the limbs,  and it can also cause incontinence,  so it is a possible cause.
 Finally,  I need to choose the most likely cause based on the available information.  While all the choices are possible,  cardiac arrhythmia is the most likely cause of the patient's ""drop attacks"" given the combination of symptoms and the patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

She reports that she has always been an active person and does not see how her life will be of value anymore.  She has no family and most of her friends are sick or deceased.  On mental status examination,  she is alert and cooperative.  She accurately describes her medical history and understands the consequences of refusing insulin.  There is no evidence of depression.  She dismisses any attempts by the physician to change her mind,  saying that the physician is too young to understand her situation.  She says,  ""I know I will die,  and this is what I want. "" Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?  Choices: a) Discharge the patient after she has signed an ""against medical advice"" form b) Seek a court order to appoint a legal guardian c) Offer insulin but allow the patient to refuse it d) Admit to the psychiatric unit 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's autonomy and the principle of non-maleficence.  The patient is an 87 -year-old woman with a terminal illness who has a clear understanding of her medical condition and the consequences of her actions.  She has expressed her desire to refuse insulin and die.
 Next,  I need to consider the patient's mental status and capacity to make a decision.  On examination,  she is alert and cooperative,  accurately describes her medical history, and understands the consequences of refusing insulin.  There is no evidence of depression or other mental health issues that would impair her decision-making capacity.
 Based on these considerations,  the most appropriate next step in management is to respect the patient's autonomy and allow her to refuse insulin.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: An 8 -year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother because of a 3 -day history of fever,  sore throat,  and itchy eyes.  He just returned from a weeklong summer camp that included hiking trips and swimming lessons in the camp-owned swimming pool.  He has no history of major medical illness and receives no medications.  He appears tired.  His temperature is 39.4 °C (102.9 °F); other vital signs are within normal limits.  Physical examination shows conjunctival injection and discharge and oropharyngeal erythema.  The public health department reports an outbreak of similar symptoms among the other campers and camp volunteers.  Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?  Choices: a) Adenovirus b) Cytomegalovirus c) Epstein-Barr virus d) Influenza virus 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and exposure history of the patient.  The patient has a 3 -day history of fever,  sore throat,  itchy eyes, and conjunctival injection and discharge.  These symptoms are consistent with viral infections.
 Next,  I need to consider the exposure history.  The patient recently returned from a weeklong summer camp that included activities in the camp-owned swimming pool.  This exposure increases the likelihood of a waterborne or respiratory virus causing the illness.
 Finally,  I need to consider the reported outbreak among other campers and camp volunteers.  This suggests a common source of infection,  such as a virus that was transmitted through the swimming pool or other shared spaces.
 Based on these factors,  the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms is Adenovirus (a).  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 37 -year-old man comes to the emergency department because he has felt nauseated and light-headed for the past hour.  Medical history is significant for esophageal varices secondary to alcohol-related cirrhosis and ascites treated with spironolactone.  He drinks eight to ten alcoholic beverages daily.  While you are obtaining additional history,  the patient vomits a large volume of bright red blood and becomes difficult to arouse.  Vital signs are temperature 36.0 °C (96.8 °F),  pulse 110 /min,  respirations 12 /min,  and blood pressure 90 /50  mm Hg.  Following initiation of intravenous fluids,  which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management?  Choices: a) Arrange for transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunting b) Begin intravenous vasopressin therapy c) Do endotracheal intubation d) Do upper endoscopy 
 Output:
 First,  I need to assess the situation and determine the immediate life-threatening issue.  The patient has vomited a large volume of bright red blood,  which indicates bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract,  likely due to esophageal varices.  The patient is also experiencing hypotension and is difficult to arouse,  indicating a significant hemodynamic instability.

Second,  I need to consider the options available for management.  a) Transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunting is a surgical procedure that may be considered for long-term management,  but it is not an immediate option.  b) Intravenous vasopressin therapy can be used to reduce portal pressure and control bleeding from esophageal varices,  and it is an immediate option.  c) Endotracheal intubation may be necessary if the patient is experiencing respiratory distress,  but it is not an immediate option for managing the bleeding.  d) Upper endoscopy can be used to control bleeding and visualize the esophageal varices,  but it is not an immediate option.

Third,  I need to choose the option that best addresses the immediate life-threatening issue.  In this case,  the most appropriate immediate management is to control the bleeding and stabilize the patient's hemodynamics.  Option b) Begin intravenous vasopressin therapy is the most appropriate immediate management.

Choices: a) Increased intake of vitamin D b) A special exercise program c) Surgical correction d) No treatment is needed at this time 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the age and presentation of the child.  The child is 2  years old and has mild bowlegs (10 -degree genu varum).
 Next,  I need to evaluate the severity of the bowlegs.  Mild bowlegs are common in toddlers and usually resolve on their own as the child grows.
 Now,  I need to consider the potential causes of bowlegs.  In this case,  the child was weaned at 6  months of age and began to walk at 10  months of age,  which is within the normal developmental range.
 To determine the most appropriate management,  I need to weigh the potential benefits and risks of each option.  Increased intake of vitamin D may be helpful in some cases,  but it is not the most appropriate management for mild bowlegs in a 2 -year-old.  A special exercise program may help improve muscle tone and balance,  but it is not necessary for mild bowlegs.  Surgical correction is typically reserved for more severe cases and is not recommended for mild bowlegs in a 2 -year-old.

Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the medical student regarding this patient's invitation?  Choices: a) He can date her because he was a medical student,  not a physician,  when he contributed to her care b) He can date her because she is no longer his patient c) He can date her,  but only after at least 1  year has passed since he treated her d) He cannot date her because she was once his psychiatric patient 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the principles of medical ethics,  specifically the principle of patient-doctor confidentiality and the principle of avoiding conflicts of interest.
 Next,  I need to consider the specific situation presented,  where the medical student was a medical student,  not a physician,  when he contributed to the patient's care during her hospitalization for major depressive disorder.
 Finally,  I need to evaluate the options given and determine which one is most consistent with the principles of medical ethics.

 Option a) suggests that the medical student can date the patient because he was a medical student,  not a physician,  when he contributed to her care.  This option is consistent with the principle of avoiding conflicts of interest,  as the medical student is not in a position of power or authority over the patient.
 Option b) suggests that the medical student can date the patient because she is no longer his patient.  This option is not consistent with the principle of patient-doctor confidentiality,  as the medical student had access to the patient's medical records during her hospitalization.
 Option c) suggests that the medical student can date the patient,  but only after at least 1  year has passed since he treated her.  This option is not consistent with the principle of avoiding conflicts of interest,  as the medical student may still have a professional interest in the patient's well-being.
 Option d) suggests that the medical student cannot date the patient because she was once his psychiatric patient.  This option is not consistent with the principle of avoiding conflicts of interest,  as the medical student is not in a position of power or authority over the patient.

Leukocyte count is 12,000 /mm3  ,  and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is 5.0  μU/mL.  An ECG shows sinus tachycardia.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  Choices: a) Acute stress disorder b) Agoraphobia c) Generalized anxiety disorder d) Hypothyroidism 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and symptoms.  She has a 2 -week history of increased anxiety,  abdominal discomfort,  irritability,  and difficulty concentrating,  which could be consistent with anxiety disorders.  She was robbed at knifepoint 3  weeks ago,  which could have triggered a traumatic event.  Her physical examination shows dry skin and hair,  which could suggest hypothyroidism.  Her leukocyte count is elevated,  and her serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is increased,  which supports the diagnosis of hypothyroidism.  However,  the key symptoms and history are the anxiety and traumatic event.

Next,  I need to consider the differential diagnoses.  Acute stress disorder would be a possible diagnosis,  considering the traumatic event 3  weeks ago.  Agoraphobia is a fear of being in places or situations from which escape might be difficult,  which is not directly related to the patient's symptoms.  Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive worry and tension,  which could be consistent with the patient's symptoms.  Hypothyroidism is a medical condition,  but it does not explain the anxiety and traumatic event.

Therefore,  the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 29 -year-old Hispanic woman,  gravida 3,  para 3,  comes to the office because of recurrent low back pain during the past year.

Medical history is remarkable for gestational diabetes mellitus during her pregnancies.  She takes no medications except for an oral contraceptive.  She walks 3  miles daily for exercise and works as a sales representative for a computer software company.  She is 165  cm (5  ft 5  in) tall and weighs 100  kg (220  lb); BMI is 37  kg/m2  .  Vital signs are normal,  and physical examination discloses no abnormalities.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?  Choices: a) Administer an epidural injection of methylprednisolone b) Order MRI of the lumbosacral spine c) Order x-rays of the lumbosacral spine d) Recommend beginning a weight loss program 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's symptoms and history.  The pain is recurrent and is relieved by rest and analgesics.  The patient has a history of gestational diabetes mellitus and is currently overweight with a BMI of 37 kg/m2.  This suggests that the pain may be related to obesity and possibly diabetic neuropathy.
 Next,  I need to consider the available diagnostic options.  An epidural injection of methylprednisolone is a treatment option,  but it does not provide diagnostic information.  An MRI of the lumbosacral spine can provide detailed images of the spine,  but it is expensive and may not be necessary initially.  An x-ray of the lumbosacral spine can provide some information about the bones of the spine,  but it is not as detailed as an MRI.  A weight loss program is important for the patient's overall health,  but it is not a diagnostic option.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate next step is to {'sol': 'c'}"

"" She requests a laxative to help with her constipation.  She is 158  cm (5  ft 2  in) tall and weighs 43  kg (95  lb); BMI is 18  kg/m2  .  Pulse is 65 /min.  Specific additional history should be obtained regarding which of the following?  Choices: a) Color,  caliber,  and frequency of bowel movements b) Exposure to sexually transmitted diseases c) Family history of irritable bowel syndrome d) Menstrual history 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's age,  height,  and weight to determine if there is a potential issue with her growth.  The patient's BMI is 18  kg/m2,  which is below the normal range.  This could indicate a potential growth issue.
 Next,  I need to consider the patient's symptoms and history.  The patient is experiencing abdominal pain and constipation,  which could be related to a growth issue or other underlying conditions.
 The patient is 15 years old,  so it is important to consider her menstrual history,  as this could be related to her growth and symptoms.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 37 -year-old man with type 1  diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital because of inadequate control of his glucose concentrations for the past 2  months.  Despite his poor control,  he demands that he be discharged.  He reports that he has had a 3 -month history of fatigue,  irritability,  and feelings of hopelessness.  He says that he has been noncompliant with his diabetic regimen,  adding,  ""Sometimes I forget. "" He has been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them but admits that he is lonely.  He did not get out of bed for 2  days,  which prompted his wife to call an ambulance and have him admitted to the hospital.  Prior to admission to the hospital,  his only medication was insulin,  although he often missed doses.  He does not drink alcohol.  He is 168  cm (5  ft 6  in) tall and weighs 100  kg (220  lb); BMI is 36  kg/m2  .  His temperature is 37 °C (98.6 °F),  pulse is 68 /min,  respirations are 18 /min,  and blood pressure is 150 /85  mm Hg.  Physical examination shows no abnormalities.  On mental status examination,  he is tired and has a restricted affect.  There is no evidence of suicidal ideation.  Cognition is intact.  His fasting serum glucose concentration is 120  mg/dL.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?  Choices: a) Adhere to the patient's wishes and discuss home-care options b) Adhere to the patient's wishes on the condition that he agree to home nursing care c) Schedule neuropsychological testing d) Seek a court order to appoint a legal guardian 
 Output:
 First,  I need to assess the patient's current condition and determine the most appropriate next step in management.  The patient has type 1 diabetes mellitus with inadequate control of his glucose concentrations,  and he is experiencing symptoms of depression and loneliness.  His fasting serum glucose concentration is 120  mg/dL,  which is above the target range of 70-130  mg/dL.  He is also overweight with a BMI of 36  kg/m2 .
 The most appropriate next step in management is to ensure that the patient's diabetes is well-controlled and that his mental health needs are addressed.  Option a) suggests adhering to the patient's wishes and discussing home-care options, but this is not appropriate given his current condition and the potential for serious complications from poorly controlled diabetes.  Option b) suggests adhering to the patient's wishes on the condition that he agree to home nursing care,  which may be a better option,  but it does not address his mental health needs.  Option c) suggests scheduling neuropsychological testing,  which may be useful to assess his cognitive function and mental state,  but it does not address his diabetes management or his need for mental health support.  Option d) suggests seeking a court order to appoint a legal guardian,  which is an extreme measure and may not be necessary at this point.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate next step in management is to ensure that the patient's diabetes is well-controlled and that his mental health needs are addressed.  This may involve hospitalization,  additional mental health support,  and home-care options with the patient's participation.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 7 -month-old infant,  who was recently discharged from the hospital following an episode of enteritis and dehydration,  has persistent watery diarrhea.  His mother feeds him cow-milk formula and a variety of strained fruits and vegetables.  On physical examination,  his temperature is 37.4 °C (99.3 °F),  his mucous membranes are dry,  and his abdomen is slightly distended.  No other abnormalities are seen.  The problem is most likely related to which of the following?  Choices: a) Fructose intolerance b) Transient lactase deficiency c) Magnesium deficiency d) Regional enteritis 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation of the infant.  He has persistent watery diarrhea,  which is a common symptom of enteritis.  His temperature is slightly elevated,  but not high enough to suggest an infection.  His mucous membranes are dry,  indicating dehydration.  His abdomen is slightly distended,  which could be due to fluid loss or gas accumulation.
 Next,  I need to consider the dietary factors.  His mother feeds him cow-milk formula,  which is a common cause of diarrhea in infants.  Additionally,  he is being given strained fruits and vegetables,  which could also contribute to diarrhea.
 Finally,  I need to consider the possible causes of the diarrhea.  Fructose intolerance is a rare condition that can cause diarrhea,  but it is not common in infants.  Transient lactase deficiency is a common cause of diarrhea in infants,  especially when cow's milk is introduced into their diet.  Magnesium deficiency can cause diarrhea,  but it is not a common cause in infants.  Regional enteritis is a condition that can cause persistent diarrhea,  but it is not common in infants.
 Based on the clinical presentation and dietary factors,  the most likely cause of the infant's persistent watery diarrhea is transient lactase deficiency.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 25 -year-old gravida 3  para 2  female is admitted to the hospital at 39  weeks' gestation in active labor.  She had been having regular contractions every 4  minutes,  but is now having only a few intermittent,  weak contractions.  She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6  hours.  Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor.  The fetal head is engaged,  the membranes are intact,  the fetal heart tones are normal,  and the cervix is 100 % effaced and 7  cm dilated.  The most appropriate management is to Choices: a) administer an epidural anesthetic b) administer tocolytic therapy c) apply cervical topical corticosteroids d) augment the labor with oxytocin 
 Output:
 First,  I need to assess the current state of the patient's labor.  The patient is 39  weeks' gestation,  in active labor,  with the cervix 100  % effaced and 7  cm dilated.  This indicates that the patient is close to full term and close to delivering the baby.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the contractions.  The contractions have become less frequent and weak,  and the patient has received medication for pain twice in the past 6  hours.  This suggests that the labor is slowing down and may need assistance to progress.
 Finally,  I need to consider the examination findings.  There is no reason for obstructed labor,  the fetal head is engaged,  the membranes are intact,  and the fetal heart tones are normal.
 Based on these considerations,  the most appropriate management is to augment the labor with oxytocin ({'sol': 'd'})"
"Input: A 15 -year-old girl comes to the emergency department because,  she says,  ""something has been sticking out of my bottom since I had a bowel movement this morning. "" She has not had previous episodes,  although for more than 1  year she has had occasional difficulty passing stools.  She is not in pain but is afraid to move her bowels for fear that the problem will worsen.  She tells you that she moved away from home more than a year ago and that her parents contribute nothing to her support.  She has a 6 -month-old child and lives with a 28 -year-old female cousin.  She has never been married and does not work or attend school.  She has no other symptoms.  In order to follow the correct procedure for treating a minor,  which of the following is the most appropriate step prior to evaluating this patient's rectal problem?  Choices: a) Accept the girl's consent as sufficient b) Obtain a court order permitting evaluation c) Obtain the written consent of at least two licensed physicians d) Obtain written consent from at least one of her parents 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the legal age of consent for a minor in this context.  Since the girl is 15 years old,  she is below the legal age of consent in many jurisdictions.
 Next,  I need to consider the legal requirements for treating minors in the emergency department.  In many jurisdictions,  written consent from a parent or legal guardian is required before treating a minor.
 However,  the girl has stated that her parents contribute nothing to her support and she has been living independently for more than a year.  This suggests that she may not have a legal guardian present or available.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate step prior to evaluating the patient's rectal problem is to obtain written consent from at least one of her parents.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 37 -year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 45  minutes after she was found unconscious on her apartment floor.  Her coworkers became concerned when she did not arrive for work.  On arrival,  she is unable to provide a history.  Her pulse is 96 /min,  respirations are 12 /min,  and blood pressure is 124 /58  mm Hg.  Examination shows erythema,  warmth,  and induration of the upper back,  buttocks,  and posterior thighs.  Her serum creatine kinase activity is 10,300  U/L.  Urine toxicology screening is positive for opiates and cocaine.  Urine dipstick is strongly positive for blood.  Microscopic examination of the urine shows pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes.  This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions over the next 24  hours?  Choices: a) Acute respiratory distress syndrome b) Acute tubular necrosis c) Cerebral edema d) Cerebral hemorrhage 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the patient's presenting symptoms and laboratory findings.  The patient is unconscious,  has a history of opiates and cocaine use,  and has elevated serum creatine kinase activity and positive urine toxicology screening.  The microscopic examination of the urine shows pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes,  which are suggestive of renal injury.
 Next,  I need to consider the potential causes of renal injury in this patient.  Opioid and cocaine use can lead to acute tubular necrosis,  a condition characterized by renal failure and the presence of casts and red blood cells in the urine.
 Finally,  I need to determine which of the listed conditions is most likely to occur in the next 24  hours.  Acute respiratory distress syndrome is more commonly associated with pneumonia or severe asthma,  cerebral edema and cerebral hemorrhage are more commonly associated with head trauma or hypertension,  and acute tubular necrosis is more commonly associated with renal failure due to nephrotoxic drugs.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 34 -year-old white woman comes to the emergency department because of a persistent dull headache for the past 3  days.  She has been taking acetaminophen without relief.  She says,  ""I haven't slept in 3  days and I am having trouble focusing at work. "" There is no history of trauma and she takes no medications.  She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 14  years but does not drink alcoholic beverages.  Vital signs are temperature 37.5 °C (99.5 °F),  pulse 86 /min,  respirations 19 /min,  and blood pressure 182 /100  mm Hg.  Examination of the head shows no abnormalities.  Pupils are equal,  round,  and reactive to light; there is mild photophobia.  Funduscopic examination is normal.  A serous effusion is noted on examination of the left tympanic membrane.  Neck is stiff with painful flexion; when the patient's neck is flexed forward,  she reports and electric shock sensation.  Mild expiratory wheezes are heard on auscultation of the chest.  A midsystolic click is heard best at the left sternal border; there are no murmurs or gallops.  Abdominal examination shows striae,  but is otherwise noncontributory.  Examination of the lower extremities shows varicosities bilaterally and 1 + edema; muscle strength is 4 /5.  Neurologic examination shows no other abnormalities.  Which of the following physical findings is most indicative of the need for immediate further evaluation?  Choices: a) Abdominal striae b) Expiratory wheezes c) Midsystolic click d) Neck stiffness 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the physical findings that are most concerning and potentially indicative of a serious underlying condition.  Among the options,  a) abdominal striae,  b) expiratory wheezes,  c) midsystolic click,  and d) neck stiffness,  the most concerning finding is d) neck stiffness.  Neck stiffness can be a sign of meningitis,  which requires immediate further evaluation.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 14 -year-old girl is brought to the physician after her mother learned that she began having sexual intercourse with various partners 1  month ago.  She does not use condoms or other contraception.  The mother is concerned about her behavior.  The patient's parents separated 3  months ago.  She had been an honor student and excelled in sports and leadership positions at school before the separation.  Since the separation,  however,  she has become sullen,  defiant,  and rebellious.  She has begun smoking cigarettes,  disobeying her curfew,  and being truant from school.  This patient is most likely using which of the following defense mechanisms?  Choices: a) Acting out b) Displacement c) Projection d) Reaction formation 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the defense mechanisms and their definitions.  Acting out is engaging in risky or rebellious behavior.  Displacement is redirecting emotions from one person to another.  Projection is attributing one's own feelings,  thoughts,  or behaviors to someone else.  Reaction formation is displaying the opposite of one's true feelings or desires.
 Next,  I need to analyze the patient's behavior.  She began having sexual intercourse,  smoking cigarettes,  disobeying her curfew,  and being truant from school.  These behaviors are consistent with acting out and reaction formation.
 However,  the question asks for the most likely defense mechanism.  The patient's behavior is more consistent with reaction formation,  as she is displaying the opposite of her true feelings or desires.  Her true feelings may be sadness,  anger,  or rejection due to her parents' separation,  and she is engaging in risky and rebellious behavior as a result.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A previously healthy 27 -year-old man comes to the physician 4  weeks after noticing three nontender lesions on his penis.  He says they have not changed in size.  He is sexually active with multiple male and female partners and uses condoms inconsistently.  He takes no medications.  He drinks two to five beers on social occasions.  He occasionally smokes marijuana.  His temperature is 36.9 °C (98.4 °F).  There is no lymphadenopathy.  Examination shows three sessile,  flesh-colored lesions on the shaft of the penis that are 10  mm in diameter.  On application of a dilute solution of acetic acid,  the lesions turn white.  The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?  Choices: a) Oral acyclovir therapy b) Oral doxycycline therapy c) Intramuscular penicillin therapy d) Cryotherapy 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the lesions and their characteristics.  The lesions are sessile,  flesh-colored,  10  mm in diameter,  and turn white on application of acetic acid.  These are consistent with herpes simplex virus (HSV) lesions.
 Next,  I need to consider the appropriate management for HSV lesions.  Oral acyclovir therapy is commonly used for the treatment of HSV lesions.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate next step in management is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 59 -year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 4 -day history of nausea,  vomiting,  and diarrhea.  He also has been confused and agitated during this period.  He has a history of mild hypertension.  His current medication is a diuretic.  His temperature is 37 °C (98.6 °F),  pulse is 108 /min,  respirations are 26 /min,  and blood pressure is 70 /47  mm Hg.  Physical examination shows delayed capillary refill of the lips and nail beds and cool extremities.  His oxyhemoglobin saturation in a central vein is 60 % (N=70 –75 ).  These findings are most consistent with which of the following types of shock?  Choices: a) Cardiogenic b) Distributive c) Hypovolemic d) Obstructive 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation and physical examination findings.  The patient has a history of nausea,  vomiting,  and diarrhea,  which can lead to significant fluid loss.  Additionally,  the patient has delayed capillary refill and cool extremities,  which are signs of decreased blood flow to the skin.  The low oxyhemoglobin saturation in a central vein further supports the possibility of hypovolemia.

Next,  I need to consider the possible causes of shock.  Cardiogenic shock is caused by a decrease in cardiac output,  which is not supported by the patient's findings.  Distributive shock is caused by a redistribution of blood flow,  which is not supported by the patient's findings.  Hypovolemic shock is caused by a decrease in blood volume,  which is supported by the patient's history of vomiting and diarrhea,  as well as the physical examination findings.  Obstructive shock is caused by a blockage in the vascular system,  which is not supported by the patient's findings.

Therefore,  the most consistent diagnosis is hypovolemic shock.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 13 -month-old child is brought to the emergency department because of urticaria,  swelling of the lips,  and difficulty breathing immediately after eating an egg.  A potential risk for hypersensitivity reaction is posed by vaccination against which of the following illnesses?  Choices: a) Hepatitis b) Influenza c) Pertussis d) Poliomyelitis 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the symptoms described,  which are urticaria,  swelling of the lips,  and difficulty breathing.  These symptoms are consistent with an allergic reaction.
 Next,  I need to consider which of the vaccines can cause an allergic reaction.  All vaccines can cause an allergic reaction,  but some vaccines are more commonly associated with allergic reactions.
 Among the choices,  Hepatitis and Influenza vaccines are live-attenuated vaccines,  which can cause more severe reactions.  Pertussis and Poliomyelitis vaccines are not live-attenuated vaccines,  so they are less likely to cause severe allergic reactions.
 Therefore,  the potential risk for hypersensitivity reaction posed by vaccination is more likely to be from the Hepatitis or Influenza vaccine.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 27 -year-old man is admitted to the hospital 45  minutes after being involved in a motor vehicle collision.  Physical examination shows a sluggish response to stimuli.  Neurologic examination shows no other abnormalities.  A skull x-ray shows a linear,  nondepressed basal skull fracture.  Two weeks later,  the patient develops polyuria and polydipsia.  Laboratory studies show a serum glucose concentration within the reference range,  increased serum osmolality,  and decreased urine osmolality.  Following the administration of desmopressin,  urine osmolality increases.  The beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to activation of which of the following?  Choices: a) Adenylyl cyclase b) Ca2 + channels c) Janus kinase d) Serine kinase 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the clinical scenario.  The patient was involved in a motor vehicle collision,  showed signs of a possible brain injury,  and later developed polyuria and polydipsia,  along with increased serum osmolality and decreased urine osmolality.  Desmopressin,  a drug used to treat diabetes insipidus,  was administered and showed a beneficial effect in increasing urine osmolality.

Next,  I need to identify the mechanism of action of desmopressin.  Desmopressin is a synthetic form of vasopressin,  and its mechanism involves the activation of the vasopressin receptor,  specifically the V2  receptor,  on the surface of the collecting ducts in the kidneys.  This activation leads to the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase,  resulting in an increase in intracellular cAMP levels.  The increased cAMP levels cause the ducts to become more permeable to water,  thereby increasing the reabsorption of water and the concentration of urine osmolality.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 35 -year-old female develops nausea and vomiting after she underwent a cholecystectomy for protracted ileus.  Her body mass index was 23  kg/m2  before surgery,  and,  except for the cholecystitis,  she was in good health.  The patient remains unable to eat 6  days after surgery.  Which of the following forms of nutritional support is most appropriate for this patient?  Choices: a) central hyperalimentation b) feeding through a nasogastric feeding tube c) oral fat-free modular diet d) peripheral hyperalimentation 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's age,  surgical history,  and current condition.  The patient is 35 years old,  has undergone cholecystectomy,  and is unable to eat for 6 days.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the options for nutritional support.  a) Central hyperalimentation involves feeding through a central line,  which may not be necessary for this patient.  b) A nasogastric feeding tube can provide nutrition directly to the stomach,  but it may not be the most appropriate option for a patient who is unable to eat for an extended period.  c) An oral fat-free modular diet can be a good option for providing nutrition,  but it may not be sufficient for a patient unable to eat for 6 days.  d) Peripheral hyperalimentation involves feeding through a peripheral line,  which can be a good option for providing nutrition without the need for a central line.
 Considering the patient's condition,  the most appropriate form of nutritional support is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 27 -year-old nurse comes to the emergency department because of nervousness,  dizziness,  palpitations,  and excess perspiration for the past 3  hours.  She has had similar episodes over the past 6  months.  The symptoms improve following ingestion of orange juice or soft drinks.  She says that she has had a great deal of stress.  She has been drinking two alcoholic beverages daily for the past month; before this time,  she seldom drank alcohol.  Examination shows no abnormalities.  Her serum glucose concentration is 30  mg/dL.  Intravenous glucose is administered,  and the patient's symptoms improve.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?  Choices: a) Measurement of serum proinsulin and insulin antibodies b) Measurement of serum cortisol and ACTH concentrations c) Measurement of serum growth hormone and plasma somatomedin-C concentrations d) Measurement of serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the possible causes of the patient's symptoms.  The fact that the symptoms improve following ingestion of orange juice or soft drinks suggests that the patient may have low blood sugar levels.  The fact that she has been drinking two alcoholic beverages daily for the month before this suggests that she may have developed insulin resistance or hypoglycemia due to alcohol consumption.
 The most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be to confirm the presence of low blood sugar levels and to determine if there is a problem with insulin production or resistance.  Therefore,  the most appropriate next step is to measure serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 54 -year-old woman comes to the office because she has had intermittent shooting pain over her right cheek and jaw during the past 3  weeks.

Medical history is remarkable for tension headaches,  obesity,  and gastric bypass surgery.  She is 165  cm (5  ft 5  in) tall and weighs 62  kg (137  lb); BMI is 23  kg/m2  .  Vital signs are normal.  The patient cannot tolerate touch over the right side of the face.  There is no facial weakness or loss of sensation.  The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities.  CT scan of the head with and without contrast shows no abnormalities.  Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time?  Choices: a) Carbamazepine b) Lamotrigine c) Levetiracetam d) Topiramate 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the diagnosis.  The patient has intermittent shooting pain over her right cheek and jaw,  often triggered by cold air,  chewing,  tactile stimulation,  and brushing her teeth.  There is no trauma to the face or head,  and the physical examination shows no abnormalities.  The CT scan of the head is also normal.  Based on these findings,  the diagnosis is likely trigeminal neuralgia.
 Next,  I need to consider the pharmacotherapy for trigeminal neuralgia.  The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for trigeminal neuralgia is carbamazepine.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 12 -year-old boy with sickle cell disease and type 1  diabetes mellitus is brought to the office by his mother for an initial visit.  The family recently moved to the area.  Type 1  diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in the patient 6  years ago.  Since that time,  he has been treated with insulin and dietary management.  His insulin regimen has not changed during the past year; however,  his mother says he has been only marginally compliant with his insulin and dietary regimens.  His diabetic diary shows home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations ranging from 140 –200  mg/dL during the past 3  months.  He admits to checking his glucose concentrations infrequently.  Measurement of hemoglobin A1 c obtained last week was 5.4 %.  The patient's vital signs are temperature 36.8 °C (98.2 °F),  pulse 72 /min,  respirations 24 /min,  and blood pressure 110 /64  mm Hg.  Physical examination shows no abnormalities.  Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the discrepancy between the patient's home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations and his hemoglobin A1 c?  Choices: a) His daily glucose control is better than recorded b) His glucometer is reading falsely high and should be replaced c) His hemoglobin A1 c is likely a result of laboratory error and should be repeated d) His sickle cell disease is affecting his hemoglobin A1 c 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the relationship between short-term and long-term blood glucose control.  Hemoglobin A1 c is a marker of average blood glucose control over the past 2-3  months,  while fingerstick blood glucose measurements are more reflective of short-term control.  If the patient is marginally compliant with his insulin and dietary regimens,  it is possible that his short-term blood glucose control is not as good as his long-term control.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the given choices.  Choice a) suggests that his daily glucose control is better than recorded,  which is unlikely given his poor compliance and the range of his blood glucose concentrations.  Choice b) suggests that his glucometer is reading falsely high,  which is also unlikely given the consistency of his readings.  Choice c) suggests that his hemoglobin A1 c is a result of laboratory error,  which is less likely than choice b),  but still not the most likely explanation.  Choice d) suggests that his sickle cell disease is affecting his hemoglobin A1 c,  which is a possible explanation,  but less likely than the patient's poor compliance with his treatment.
 Therefore,  the most likely explanation for the discrepancy between the patient's home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations and his hemoglobin A1 c is his poor compliance with his insulin and dietary regimens.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 68 -year-old female has a history of breast cancer that has recurred twice in the past 5  years.  She has undergone both radiation and chemotherapy for metastatic carcinoma to the bone.  She presents to the office today to ask for help in dealing with midthoracic back pain to enable her to use less analgesic agents.  The most appropriate osteopathic manipulative technique to treat this patient's spine is Choices: a) high velocity,  low amplitude b) indirect myofascial release c) isotonic exercise therapy d) mid velocity,  mid amplitude 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's age and medical history.  The patient is 68 years old,  which is an older adult,  and has a history of breast cancer and metastatic carcinoma to the bone.  These factors suggest that the patient is at increased risk for osteoporosis and other age-related conditions.
 Next,  I need to consider the patient's current symptoms and goals.  The patient is experiencing midthoracic back pain and wants to use less analgesic agents.  This suggests that the patient is seeking a non-pharmacological treatment option.
 Finally,  I need to evaluate the available osteopathic manipulative techniques based on the patient's needs and risk factors.  High velocity, low amplitude (HVLLA) technique is generally not recommended for older adults or patients with a history of cancer due to the risk of complications.  Indirect myofascial release and isotonic exercise therapy may be appropriate for pain management but may not address the specific needs of the patient's spine.  Mid velocity, mid amplitude (MVMA) technique is a safer option for older adults and patients with a history of cancer, and is specifically designed to address spinal issues.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate osteopathic manipulative technique for this patient is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 55 -year-old woman with small cell carcinoma of the lung is admitted to the hospital to undergo chemotherapy.  Six days after treatment is started,  she develops a temperature of 38 °C (100.4 °F).  Physical examination shows no other abnormalities.  Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 100 /mm3  (5 % segmented neutrophils and 95 % lymphocytes).  Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to increase this patient's leukocyte count?  Choices: a) Darbepoetin b) Dexamethasone c) Filgrastim d) Interferon alfa 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the cause of the low leukocyte count.  In this case,  the low leukocyte count is likely due to chemotherapy,  which is known to cause neutropenia.
 Next,  I need to find a medication that can increase the leukocyte count specifically in this situation.  The most appropriate medication for this purpose is one that targets neutrophil production,  since segmented neutrophils are low due to chemotherapy.
 Among the choices,  filgrastim is a medication that stimulates the production of neutrophils and is commonly used to treat neutropenia caused by chemotherapy.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to increase this patient's leukocyte count is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 14 -year-old girl has had nausea,  intermittent diarrhea,  and a 2.2 -kg (5 -lb) weight loss over the past 4  weeks.  Examination shows a migrating serpiginous pruritic perianal rash.  Her leukocyte count is 8000 /mm3  with 20 % eosinophils.  Which of the following tests is most likely to yield an accurate diagnosis?  Choices: a) Blood smear b) Bone marrow biopsy c) KOH preparation d) Microscopic examination of the stool 
 Output:
 First,  the symptoms and examination findings suggest a potential diagnosis of Crohn's disease,  given the migrating serpiginous pruritic perianal rash and the eosinophilic leukocyte count.
 Next,  I need to consider which test is most likely to yield an accurate diagnosis for Crohn's disease.  Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease,  and the most definitive test for diagnosing it is a bone marrow biopsy,  as it can provide evidence of the presence of eosinophils and other inflammatory cells.
 Therefore,  the most likely test to yield an accurate diagnosis is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 37 -year-old Anglo-American man is admitted to the hospital for treatment for cocaine dependency.  He says he has tried repeatedly to abstain from cocaine use but lives in a part of town where there are heavy drug sales.  He did not like his hospital outpatient group but liked his single session at Cocaine Anonymous.  Vital signs are temperature 37.0 °C (98.6 °F),  pulse 70 /min,  respirations 16 /min,  and blood pressure 125 /85  mm Hg.  Physical examination shows a thin man with good muscle strength and no focal neurologic deficits.  The patient is using insurance coverage through his wife but does not wish for his diagnosis to be disclosed to anyone.  He is on probation after a conviction for aggravated robbery 3  years ago.  There is also a warrant for his arrest for assault and battery.  After listening to his requests and weighing your obligations,  you should disclose this patient's diagnosis only to which of the following?  Choices: a) His Cocaine Anonymous sponsor b) His probation officer c) His wife d) Insurance company 
 Output:
 First,  we need to consider the patient's wishes and the legal obligations.  The patient does not wish for his diagnosis to be disclosed to anyone,  except for his Cocaine Anonymous sponsor.
 Next,  we need to consider the legal obligations.  The patient has a warrant for his arrest for assault and battery,  and he is on probation after a conviction for aggravated robbery.  His probation officer is responsible for monitoring him and reporting to the court.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 14 -year-old boy is brought to the physician for a physical examination prior to participating in sports.  He appears reluctant to remove his shirt for the examination,  and says that he is embarrassed because he has grown breasts during the past year.  He is at the 50 th percentile for height and weight.  Physical examination shows bilateral 1.5 -cm fibroglandular masses located beneath the nipple-areolar complex and normal penis and testes.  Pubic hair development is Tanner stage 3.  Serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones,  estrogens,  and testosterone are within the reference ranges.  Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's breast enlargement?  Choices: a) Estradiol-secreting Leydig cell tumor b) Peutz-Jeghers syndrome c) Seminiferous tubule dysgenesis (Klinefelter syndrome) d) Normal development 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's age and the presence of breast enlargement.  The patient is 14 years old,  which is a typical age for pubertal development.  Breast enlargement during puberty is common and usually resolves on its own.
 Next,  I need to consider the physical examination findings.  The presence of bilateral fibroglandular masses beneath the nipple-areolar complex and normal testes and penis suggest that the enlargement is related to pubertal changes.
 Finally,  I need to consider the laboratory results.  The normal concentrations of gonadotropic hormones,  estrogens,  and testosterone support the idea that the patient's breast enlargement is related to normal pubertal development.
 Therefore,  the most likely cause of this patient's breast enlargement is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 37 -year-old man comes to the physician because of nonradiating low back pain for 3  days.  The pain began after he worked in his yard.  He has not had any change in bowel movements or urination.  He had one similar episode 3  years ago that resolved spontaneously.  Vital signs are within normal limits.  Examination of the back shows bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm.  Range of motion is limited by pain.  Straight-leg raising is negative.  In addition to analgesia,  which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?  Choices: a) Bed rest b) Regular activity c) X-rays of the spine d) MRI of the spine 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and physical examination.  The pain is nonradiating and has a known history of spontaneous resolution.  The range of motion is limited by pain,  but straight-leg raising is negative,  which suggests a soft tissue etiology rather than a structural issue.  Given these findings,  it is unlikely that an imaging study like X-rays or MRI would provide additional information that would change the management.  Bed rest and regular activity are both potential management strategies,  but the most appropriate next step is likely to be bed rest,  as it can help reduce pain and inflammation while allowing the soft tissue injury to heal.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 29 -year-old woman comes to the emergency department because she has had increasingly severe lower abdominal pain and nausea for the past 2  days.  She is sexually active and does not use any contraception.  Her last menstrual period ended 6  days ago.  Temperature is 38.3 °C (101.0 °F).  Physical examination discloses abdominal tenderness in the lower quadrants bilaterally with rebound and guarding.  Pelvic examination discloses leukorrhea at the cervical os and tenderness of the uterus to palpation.  The adnexal areas are tender but no masses are palpable.  Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnostic study?  Choices: a) Cervical culture b) Culdocentesis c) Laparoscopy d) Serum β-hCG concentration 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and physical examination findings.  The patient has lower abdominal pain,  nausea,  and a sexually transmitted infection.  The physical examination shows tenderness in the lower quadrants,  rebound and guarding,  leukorrhea at the cervical os,  and tenderness of the uterus to palpation.  The adnexal areas are tender but no masses are palpable.

Second,  I need to identify the possible diagnoses based on the patient's presentation.  The most likely diagnoses are pelvic inflammatory disease (PID),  salpingitis,  and possibly ectopic pregnancy.

Third,  I need to determine the most appropriate diagnostic study for the suspected conditions.  Cervical culture is used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis and other infections,  which is not the most relevant in this case.  Culdocentesis is a diagnostic test for PID and can help identify the presence of pus in the cul-de-sac.  Laparoscopy can provide direct visualization of the pelvic organs and can help diagnose PID,  salpingitis,  and ectopic pregnancy.  Serum β-hCG concentration is used to detect elevated levels of human chorionic gonadotropin,  which is indicative of a pregnancy,  either normal or ectopic.

Based on the available choices and the suspected conditions,  the most appropriate diagnostic study is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 57 -year-old woman comes to the office for a preoperative evaluation 2  weeks before undergoing scheduled laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Medical history is otherwise unremarkable and the patient takes no medications.  Family history is significant for stable angina in her father and rheumatoid arthritis in her mother.  The patient has a 102 -year-old grandmother who resides in a nursing care facility and has Parkinson disease.  The patient does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcoholic beverages.  During the interview,  her face is expressionless.  She has a flexed posture and is unable to open her mouth wide.  She is 173  cm (5  ft 8  in) tall and weighs 81  kg (179  lb); BMI is 27  kg/m2  .  Vital signs are normal.  Physical examination discloses thickening and hardening of the skin over the dorsum of the hands and forearms,  as well as mild kyphosis.  Strength testing shows no abnormalities; muscle tension is normal.  Passive and active range of motion of the upper extremities is full.  Gait is slow and deliberate.  The remainder of the physical examination discloses no abnormalities.  Prior to surgery,  further evaluation is indicated for which of the following conditions in this patient?  Choices: a) Parkinson disease b) Progressive supranuclear palsy c) Sarcopenia d) Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the condition that requires further evaluation in the patient.  The patient has thickening and hardening of the skin over the dorsum of the hands and forearms,  which is suggestive of a connective tissue disorder.  This is consistent with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma).
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 40 -year-old man comes to the office for a preemployment physical examination.  The patient has been generally healthy.  Medical history is unremarkable and he takes no routine medications.  Vital signs are normal.  Physical examination shows a palpable nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland.  Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is within the reference range.  Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland confirms a solid,  1 -cm nodule.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?  Choices: a) CT scan of the neck b) Fine-needle aspiration of the nodule c) Radionuclide thyroid scan d) Thyroidectomy 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the characteristics of the nodule and the patient's history.  The nodule is solid and 1  cm in size,  and the serum TSH concentration is within the reference range.  This suggests that the nodule is likely benign.
 Next,  I need to determine the most appropriate next step in evaluation.  Since the nodule is small and likely benign,  a CT scan of the neck or a radionuclide thyroid scan may not be necessary.  A fine-needle aspiration of the nodule can provide a definitive diagnosis,  but it is not always necessary for small,  benign nodules.
 The most appropriate next step in evaluation is to perform a fine-needle aspiration of the nodule.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 2 -month-old female is brought to the office for her first routine health maintenance examination and for her immunization update.  In order to determine whether or not any contraindications exist for diphtheria,  tetanus,  pertussis (DtaP) immunization,  the parents should be questioned regarding Choices: a) allergy to eggs b) Apgar scores at birth c) gestational age at birth d) previous seizures 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the potential contraindications for diphtheria,  tetanus,  pertussis (DtaP) immunization.  The main contraindications are allergy to eggs,  previous seizures,  and certain medical conditions.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  Allergy to eggs is a potential contraindication,  as the DtaP vaccine contains trace amounts of egg protein.
 Apgar scores at birth and gestational age at birth are not contraindications for the DtaP vaccine.
 Previous seizures are another contraindication for the DtaP vaccine.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A male neonate,  who was born at 36  weeks' gestation 2  hours ago in the labor and delivery unit of the hospital,  now shows signs of respiratory difficulty.  The mother,  an 18 -year-old primigravid woman,  smoked one pack of cigarettes daily throughout her pregnancy.  She received prenatal care during most of the pregnancy.  One episode of chlamydial cervicitis was detected during the last trimester and treated with azithromycin.  The neonate was born via cesarean delivery due to fetal heart rate decelerations.  The amniotic fluid was stained with light particulate meconium.  Apgar scores were 9  and 9  at 1  and 5  minutes,  respectively.  The patient is 50  cm (20  in; 50 th percentile) long and weighs 3005  g (6  lb 10  oz; 50 th percentile); head circumference is 35  cm (14  in; 50 th percentile).  The infant's vital signs now are temperature 36.6 °C (97.8 °F),  pulse 150 /min,  and respirations 70 /min.  Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95 %.  Physical examination discloses mild subcostal and intercostal retractions.  Chest x-ray shows prominent pulmonary vascular markings and fluid in the intralobar fissures.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  Choices: a) Group B streptococcal sepsis b) Meconium aspiration syndrome c) Respiratory distress syndrome d) Transient tachypnea of newborn 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and findings presented.  The neonate shows signs of respiratory difficulty,  with subcostal and intercostal retractions,  and a chest x-ray showing fluid in the intralobar fissures.  These findings are consistent with respiratory distress.
 Next,  I need to consider the risk factors for the presented conditions.  The mother smoked during pregnancy,  which increases the risk of respiratory problems in the neonate.  The amniotic fluid was stained with light particulate meconium,  which is a risk factor for meconium aspiration syndrome.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the options.  Group B streptococcal sepsis would be indicated by fever,  generalized skin erythema,  and other signs of systemic infection,  which are not present in this case.  Respiratory distress syndrome would be indicated by hypoxia,  and the neonate has an oxygen saturation of 95 % on room air,  which is not low enough to suggest this diagnosis.  Transient tachypnea of the newborn would be indicated by tachypnea without other signs of respiratory distress,  which is not the case here.
 Therefore,  the most likely diagnosis is meconium aspiration syndrome,  so the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A study is conducted to assess the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of type 2  diabetes mellitus.  A total of 1000  patients with type 2  diabetes mellitus are enrolled.  Patients are randomly assigned to receive the new drug or standard treatment.  The alpha and beta values for calculating probability are 0.05  and 0.20,  respectively.  Results show that the new drug is significantly better than standard treatment.  If this study had been performed in a population of only 500  patients,  which of the following would have been most likely to increase?  Choices: a) Chance of a type I error b) Chance of a type II error c) Power of the study d) Sensitivity of the study 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concepts of type I and type II errors.  Type I error is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true,  while type II error is the probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.  The power of the study is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.

Next,  I need to consider the effect of sample size on these concepts.  A larger sample size generally reduces the chance of a type I error (since it makes the test more sensitive to small differences) and increases the power of the study (since it makes the test more likely to detect true effects).  A smaller sample size,  on the other hand,  increases the chance of a type II error (since it makes the test less sensitive to small differences).

In this case,  the study is performed on a smaller population of 500  patients.  This would most likely increase the chance of a type II error,  since the sample size is smaller.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 78 -year-old male presents to the office with the complaint of severe neck pain.  He rates the pain as a 7  on a scale of 0  to 10  scale.  He denies any trauma but reports that he had been doing a lot of painting over the past week.  He denies any radicular pain or numbness.  Cervical range of motion is moderately limited in all fields.  He is treated with articulatory springing technique.  Four hours later the physician receives a call from the local emergency department,  where the patient presented confused,  nauseated,  and vertiginous.  The physician may be found liable if Choices: a) the motion barrier was articulated more than 3  times b) the motion barrier was met with a vectored force from the direction of ease c) the neck was treated in simultaneous hyperrotation and extension d) the patient was previously treated for osteoarthritis of the cervical spine 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the situation described. The patient is a 78-year-old male with severe neck pain, and he was treated with the articulatory springing technique. After the treatment, the patient presented to the emergency department with symptoms of confusion, nausea, and vertiginous.

Now, let's analyze each choice to see which one could lead to the patient's symptoms:

a) If the motion barrier was articulated more than 3 times, it could potentially cause irritation or damage to the surrounding structures, leading to the patient's symptoms.

b) The motion barrier being met with a vectored force from the direction of ease might not directly cause the patient's symptoms, as the ease of motion direction does not inherently lead to negative outcomes.

c) Treating the neck in simultaneous hyperrotation and extension could potentially overload the structures around the neck, leading to the patient's symptoms.

d) The patient's previous treatment for osteoarthritis of the cervical spine might not directly cause the patient's symptoms, as it is a separate condition and not directly related to the treatment provided.

Based on the analysis, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is the treatment technique used, specifically the way the motion barrier was handled. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A physician is conducting a retrospective review of a trial involving the use of Drug X in patients with a specific disease.  It is known that Drug X is associated with an increased probability of cancer in patients who use the drug.  A total of 600  individuals with a specific disease were included in the trial.  Of the participants,  200  individuals received Drug X and 400  individuals did not receive it.  One hundred individuals who received Drug X died of a particular type of cancer and 100  individuals who did not receive the drug died of the same type of cancer.  Based on these data,  which of the following is the relative risk of death from this type of cancer in individuals who take Drug X as compared with individuals who do not take Drug X?  Choices: a) Individuals who take Drug X have an equal risk of dying from this type of cancer b) Individuals who take Drug X have four times the risk of dying from this type of cancer c) Individuals who take Drug X have three times the risk of dying from this type of cancer d) Individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer 
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the number of individuals who died from cancer in each group.  In the group that received Drug X,  100  individuals died of cancer.  In the group that did not receive Drug X,  100  individuals died of cancer.
 Next,  I need to calculate the probability of dying from cancer in each group.  The probability of dying from cancer in the group that received Drug X is 100  ÷ 200  = 0.5.  The probability of dying from cancer in the group that did not receive Drug X is 100  ÷ 400  = 0.25.
 To find the relative risk,  I divide the probability of dying from cancer in the group that received Drug X by the probability of dying from cancer in the group that did not receive Drug X: 0.5 ÷ 0.25 = 2.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 27 -year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3 -year history of chronic diarrhea and intermittent,  crampy,  lower abdominal pain.  The pain is usually relieved with defecation and does not occur at night or interfere with sleep.  She says she is frustrated by her symptoms and has stopped traveling because of her frequent,  urgent need to use the bathroom.  She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications.  Her temperature is 37 °C (98.6 °F),  pulse is 70 /min,  respirations are 14 /min,  and blood pressure is 120 /80  mm Hg.  The lower abdomen is mildly tender to palpation; there is no rebound tenderness or guarding.  The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.  Results of laboratory studies are within the reference ranges.  Test of the stool for occult blood is negative.  Antigliadin antibodies are not present.  Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?  Choices: a) Nefazodone b) Nortriptyline c) Phenelzine d) Sertraline 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and the laboratory results.  The patient has chronic diarrhea and crampy,  lower abdominal pain,  but no history of serious illness and normal laboratory results.  Antigliadin antibodies are not present,  which rules out celiac disease.  The negative occult blood test suggests that there is no bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract.  Based on this information,  the most likely diagnosis is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
 Next,  I need to consider the pharmacotherapy for IBS.  The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for IBS is a) Nefazodone,  which is a serotonin antagonist that can help to reduce diarrhea and cramping.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of acupuncture in children with chronic headaches.  Sixty children with chronic headaches are recruited for the study.  In addition to their usual therapy,  all children are treated with acupuncture three times a week for 2  months.  Which of the following best describes this study design?  Choices: a) Case-control b) Case series c) Crossover d) Cross-sectional 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key features of the study design.  The study recruits 60  children with chronic headaches and treats them with acupuncture three times a week for 2  months.
 Next,  I need to consider the different study designs and their characteristics.  A case-control study compares patients with a specific condition to a control group without the condition.  A case series is a collection of individual case reports.  A crossover study involves participants receiving different treatments in a randomized order.  A cross-sectional study collects data from a sample of individuals at a single point in time.
 Now,  I need to match the study design to the appropriate characteristic.  The study in question is treating all children with acupuncture and does not compare them to a control group,  so it is not a case-control study.  The study is not just a collection of individual case reports,  but rather a group of children receiving treatment,  so it is not a case series.  The study does not involve different treatments being given in a randomized order,  so it is not a crossover study.  Finally,  the study collects data from a sample of individuals at a single point in time,  and then follows them for 2  months,  so it is a cross-sectional study.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 17 -year-old girl is brought to the emergency department 15  minutes after being stung by a bee.  She has mild lightheadedness but no difficulty swallowing.  Her temperature is 37.1 °C (98.8 °F),  pulse is 100 /min,  respirations are 30 /min,  and blood pressure is 115 /70  mm Hg.  Physical examination shows no urticaria.  Bilateral wheezing is heard on auscultation of the chest.  Which of the following types of drugs is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?  Choices: a) α1 -Adrenergic agonist b) α2 -Adrenergic agonist c) α1 -Adrenergic antagonist d) β2 -Adrenergic agonist 
 Output:
 First,  we need to identify the patient's condition.  The patient presents with mild lightheadedness,  bilateral wheezing on auscultation of the chest,  and no urticaria,  which are typical signs of an acute allergic reaction to a bee sting.
 Next,  we need to consider the appropriate pharmacotherapy for this type of reaction.  Anaphylactic reactions caused by bee stings are mediated by histamine release from mast cells,  which leads to bronchoconstriction and other symptoms.
 To counteract these effects,  we need a drug that can relax the bronchial smooth muscle and increase the ventilation.  β2 -Adrenergic agonists are the most appropriate choice for this purpose,  as they stimulate the β2 -adrenergic receptors on the bronchial smooth muscle cells,  resulting in bronchodilation.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Five years after being shot in the right thigh,  a 21 -year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a buzzing sensation adjacent to the scar.  At the time of the initial wound,  he was discharged after 6  hours of observation with no fractures or soft-tissue swelling.  A loud murmur is heard on auscultation; there is a thrill.  He has dilated varicose veins with incompetent valves in the lower leg.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  Choices: a) Arterial spasm b) Arteriovenous fistula c) Deep venous thrombosis d) Occlusion of the superficial femoral artery 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and physical findings.  The patient has a buzzing sensation adjacent to the scar,  a loud murmur on auscultation,  and a thrill.  These findings suggest the presence of a shunt or abnormal flow between the arteries and veins.
 Next,  I need to consider the patient's history and physical examination.  The patient has dilated varicose veins with incompetent valves in the lower leg,  which can lead to venous reflux and the formation of a shunt.
 Finally,  I need to evaluate the options.  a) Arterial spasm is unlikely because it would not cause a buzzing sensation or abnormal flow between the arteries and veins.  b) Arteriovenous fistula is a possible diagnosis,  as it can cause a shunt between the arteries and veins.  c) Deep venous thrombosis is unlikely because it would not cause a buzzing sensation or abnormal flow between the arteries and veins.  d) Occlusion of the superficial femoral artery is unlikely because it would not cause a buzzing sensation or abnormal flow between the arteries and veins.
 Therefore,  the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A previously healthy 40 -year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of constant substernal chest pain for 12  hours that is exacerbated by coughing and inspiration.  The pain is relieved with sitting up and leaning forward.  There is no family history of heart disease.  His temperature is 38 °C (100.4 °F),  pulse is 120 /min,  and blood pressure is 110 /60  mm Hg.  The lungs are clear to auscultation.  Cardiac examination shows distant heart sounds.  An ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads.  An x-ray of the chest shows normal findings.  The most likely cause of his condition is injury to which of the following tissues?  Choices: a) Aortic intima b) Esophageal sphincter c) Myocardium d) Pericardium 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and physical examination findings.  The patient has constant substernal chest pain that is exacerbated by coughing and inspiration,  and relieved with sitting up and leaning forward.  This suggests that the pain is related to the chest wall.
 Next,  I need to consider the ECG findings.  Diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads is suggestive of myocardial ischemia or infarction.
 However,  the x-ray of the chest shows normal findings,  which means there is no evidence of pulmonary congestion or other lung pathology.  This rules out some of the other causes of chest pain,  such as pulmonary embolism or pneumonia.
 Finally,  I need to consider the physical examination finding of distant heart sounds,  which suggests that the heart is enlarged.
 Based on these findings,  the most likely cause of the patient's condition is injury to the pericardium,  as it is the only option that is consistent with the chest pain,  ECG findings,  and physical examination findings.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 24 -year-old man comes to the office because of a 2 -day history of a red,  itchy rash on his buttocks and legs.  Four days ago,  he returned from a cruise to the Caribbean,  during which he swam in the ship’s pool and used the hot tub.  He appears well.  His vital signs are within normal limits.  Physical examination shows the findings in the photograph.  The infectious agent causing these findings most likely began to proliferate in which of the following locations?  Choices: a) Apocrine gland b) Dermis c) Eccrine gland d) Hair follicle 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and the patient's history.  The patient has a red,  itchy rash on his buttocks and legs,  and he recently returned from a cruise where he swam in the ship's pool and used the hot tub.  This suggests a possible skin infection or allergic reaction.
 Next,  I need to consider the infectious agents that could cause such symptoms.  One common cause of skin infections, especially in warm and moist environments like swimming pools and hot tubs, is Staphylococcus aureus.  This bacterium can thrive in warm,  moist environments and can cause a variety of skin infections, including folliculitis and impetigo.
 Now,  I need to determine where the bacterium most likely began to proliferate.  Staphylococcus aureus can infect various sites on the skin, including apocrine glands, eccrine glands, dermis, and hair follicles.  However,  given the patient's history of swimming and using the hot tub, it is most likely that the bacterium began to proliferate in the hair follicles,  as this is a common site of infection for Staphylococcus aureus in such environments.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 15 -year-old male presents to the office with the complaint of painless swelling in the left testicle that has varied in size over the past several months.  There is no history of trauma.  The lesion transilluminates well,  and no inguinal nodes are palpable.  Findings from a testicular scan are normal.  The most appropriate management includes Choices: a) injection with a sclerosing agent b) needle aspiration c) needle biopsy d) surgical repair 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation and imaging findings.  The patient presents with painless swelling in the left testicle,  with no history of trauma,  and the lesion transilluminates well,  indicating it is not a solid mass.  The testicular scan is normal,  which further supports this assessment.
 Next,  I need to consider the differential diagnosis.  Given the painless nature of the swelling and the normal testicular scan,  the most likely diagnosis is hydrocele.
 Now,  I need to consider the appropriate management.  For hydrocele,  the most appropriate management is typically needle aspiration to relieve the pressure and resolve the swelling.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 10 -month-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 4 -day history of fever and cough.  His illness began with lowgrade fever and copious,  clear nasal discharge.  Two days ago he developed a moist,  nonproductive cough and rapid breathing.  He has received all scheduled childhood immunizations.  He attends a large day-care center and has three schoolaged siblings.  His temperature is 38 °C (100.4 °F),  pulse is 101 /min,  respirations are 38 /min,  and blood pressure is 85 /60  mm Hg.  Physical examination shows nasal flaring and rhinorrhea.  Chest examination shows intercostal retractions along with bilateral,  diffuse wheezes and expiratory rhonchi.  The infectious agent of this patient's condition most likely has which of the following properties?  Choices: a) DNA genome b) Double-stranded nucleic acid genome c) Mature virion lacking viral polymerase d) Mediation of cell entry via a fusion protein 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the infectious agent causing the patient's symptoms.  The symptoms include fever,  nasal discharge,  moist cough,  rapid breathing,  and wheezes,  which are consistent with respiratory viral infections.
 Next,  I need to consider the properties of the most common respiratory viruses.  The most common respiratory viruses have RNA genomes,  not DNA genomes,  so option a) is incorrect.  They also have single-stranded nucleic acid genomes,  not double-stranded,  so option b) is incorrect.  Some respiratory viruses,  such as influenza,  have mature virions lacking viral polymerase,  so option c) is a possible property.  Finally,  some respiratory viruses,  such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus,  mediate cell entry via a fusion protein,  so option d) is also a possible property.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 29 -year-old woman is prescribed carbamazepine for trigeminal neuralgia.  She has a strong family history of osteoporosis.  As a result,  the physician also advises her to increase her intake of vitamin D.  The most likely reason for this recommendation is that carbamazepine may affect which of the following pharmacokinetic processes?  Choices: a) Absorption b) Distribution c) Excretion d) Metabolism 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand that vitamin D is important for bone health and can help prevent osteoporosis.  The physician is advising the woman to increase her intake of vitamin D,  which suggests that there is a concern about the interaction between carbamazepine and vitamin D.
 Next,  we need to consider the pharmacokinetic processes and which one is most likely to be affected by carbamazepine.  Carbamazepine is a drug that is known to inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, which is responsible for the metabolism of many drugs.
 Therefore,  the most likely reason for the recommendation to increase vitamin D intake is that carbamazepen may affect the pharmacokinetic process of metabolism.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 57 -year-old man receives radiation therapy for a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.  Despite therapy,  the tumor progressively increases in size,  and he dies 6  months later.  His tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53  gene (TP53 ),  leading to an inactive gene product.  Based on this finding,  the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely to be related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in which of the following phases of the cell cycle?  Choices: a) G0  b) G1  c) G2  d) M 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the role of the p53  gene in the cell cycle.  The p53  gene is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a crucial role in preventing the progression of cells with DNA damage into the next phase of the cell cycle.  It acts as a checkpoint to ensure that damaged cells do not divide and potentially become cancerous.

Next,  I need to identify which phase of the cell cycle is most likely to be affected by a defective p53  gene.  The cell cycle consists of four main phases: G0, G1, S, G2, and M.  G0  is the resting phase,  where cells are not actively dividing.  G1  is the first growth phase,  where cells grow and prepare for DNA replication.  S  is the synthesis phase,  where DNA replication occurs.  G2  is the second growth phase,  where cells continue to grow and prepare for mitosis.  M  is the mitosis phase,  where the cell divides.

The p53  gene is most directly involved in cell cycle arrest during the G1  phase,  as it can inhibit the progression of cells with damaged DNA into the S  phase.  This is because the G1  phase is the first phase where cells are evaluated for DNA damage and the decision is made whether to proceed to the S  phase or to halt the cell cycle and repair the damage.

Therefore,  the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely to be related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in the G1  phase of the cell cycle.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: An 87 -year-old woman is brought to the physician by her son because of progressive memory loss over the past 2  years.  Her son says that she repeats herself frequently and has been forgetting to take her routine medications.  She takes hydrochlorothiazide for mild systolic hypertension and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.  She had vulvar cancer 10  years ago treated with wide excision.  Her blood pressure is 138 /78  mm Hg.  Physical examination is within normal limits for her age.  Mini-Mental State Examination score is 23 /30.  Laboratory studies,  including serum vitamin B12  (cyanocobalamin),  thyroxine (T4 ),  and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations,  are within normal limits.  A CT scan of the head shows mild volume loss.  Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?  Choices: a) β-Adrenergic agonist b) Cholinesterase inhibitor c) Dopamine agonist d) Prednisone 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.  The Mini-Mental State Examination score of 23/30 indicates mild cognitive impairment.  The progressive memory loss,  repetition of statements,  and forgetfulness are consistent with Alzheimer's disease.  The patient's history of vulvar cancer 10  years ago and the mild volume loss seen on the CT scan of the head also support this diagnosis.
 Next,  I need to consider the appropriate pharmacotherapy for Alzheimer's disease.  The choices given are a) β-Adrenergic agonist,  b) Cholinesterase inhibitor,  c) Dopamine agonist,  and d) Prednisone.
 Cholinesterase inhibitors are the first-line pharmacotherapy for Alzheimer's disease,  as they help to slow the progression of the disease by inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine,  a neurotransmitter important for memory and cognitive function.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A male stillborn is delivered at 32  weeks' gestation to a 30 -year-old woman.  The pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios.  Examination of the stillborn shows the absence of a urethral opening.  Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this stillborn?  Choices: a) Congenital diaphragmatic hernia b) Intralobar sequestration c) Pulmonary hypoplasia d) Situs inversus 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the key findings in this case: stillbirth at 32  weeks' gestation,  oligohydramnios,  and absence of a urethral opening.
 Oligohydramnios is a condition where there is an insufficient amount of amniotic fluid.  This can lead to complications such as fetal distress,  mechanical constraints,  and malformations.
 The absence of a urethral opening is a significant finding,  suggesting that the fetus may have been affected by a urogenital defect.
 Among the given choices,  congenital diaphragmatic hernia (a) is the most likely finding,  as it is a common cause of oligohydramnios and can result in urogenital defects.  Intralobar sequestration (b) is related to bowel obstruction and is not directly related to oligohydramnios or urogenital defects.  Pulmonary hypoplasia (c) is related to underdevelopment of the lungs and is not directly related to the findings in this case.  Situs inversus (d) is a condition where the organs are inverted,  but it is not directly related to the findings in this case.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A couple comes for preconceptional genetic counseling because they both have a family history of α-thalassemia.  The woman has a minimally decreased hemoglobin concentration.  Genetic studies show a single gene deletion.  The man has microcytic anemia and a two-gene deletion.  If the two-gene deletion is in trans (one deletion on the maternal gene and one deletion on the paternal gene),  which of the following percentages of their offspring will have a two-gene deletion?  Choices: a) 0 % b) 25 % c) 50 % d) 75 % 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the genetic background of the couple.  The woman has a single gene deletion,  which means she has one normal gene and one deleted gene.  The man has a two-gene deletion,  meaning he has two deleted genes.
 If the two-gene deletion is in trans,  it means that the couple's children will inherit one deleted gene from the mother and one deleted gene from the father.
 The possible genotypes for the children are:
 - Normal gene from mother and deleted gene from father (50 % chance)
 - Deleted gene from mother and normal gene from father (50 % chance)
 - Deleted gene from mother and deleted gene from father (0 % chance, as this would result in a three-gene deletion)
 Therefore,  50 % of their offspring will have a two-gene deletion.

Choices: a) Recommend drinking 8  oz of cranberry juice daily b) Oral amoxicillin therapy c) Oral metronidazole therapy d) Intravenous cefazolin therapy 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the diagnosis based on the symptoms and test results.  The patient has a positive urine dipstick for leukocyte esterase and urinalysis shows WBCs and gram-negative rods,  which are suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI).
 Next,  I need to consider the management options.  The patient is pregnant,  so treatment should be focused on avoiding or minimizing the use of antibiotics that could potentially harm the fetus.
 The most appropriate next step in management is to choose an antibiotic that is safe for use in pregnancy.  The choices provided are:
 a) Cranberry juice is not an antibiotic and does not address the underlying infection.
 b) Oral amoxicillin therapy is an option,  but amoxicillin is not recommended for use in pregnancy due to the risk of Clostridium difficile infection.
 c) Oral metronidazole therapy is an option,  and metronidazole is considered safe for use in pregnancy for UTIs.
 d) Intravenous cefazolin therapy is an option,  but cefazolin is not recommended for use in pregnancy.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate next step in management is to choose the option that is safe for use in pregnancy and addresses the underlying infection.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 5 -year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents for evaluation of recurrent injuries.  Her parents say that she started walking at the age of 14  months and since then has always seemed clumsier and had more injuries than other children.  She has had increasingly frequent chest pain with exertion since starting a soccer program 3  months ago.  She usually has pain or swelling of her knees or ankles after practice.  She has been wearing glasses for 2  years.  Her 16 -year-old brother has required two operations for a severe rotator cuff injury he sustained while taking a shower,  and she has a maternal cousin who died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 26  years.  Today,  the patient walks with a limp.  She is at the 99 th percentile for height and 50 th percentile for weight.  A midsystolic click is heard at the apex.  The left ankle is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain.  The joints of the upper and lower extremities are hypermobile,  including 25  degrees of genu recurvatum,  thumbs that may be extended to touch the forearms,  and flexibility at the waist,  with palms easily touching the floor with straight knees.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?  Choices: a) Skeletal survey b) Echocardiography c) Bone scan d) MRI of the shoulder 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation and family history.  The girl has recurrent injuries,  especially to the knees and ankles,  and has a limp.  She has hypermobility of the joints,  including genu recurvatum,  and a midsystolic click at the apex suggests aortic valve dysfunction.  Her family history includes aortic aneurysm and rotator cuff injuries.  These features are suggestive of Marfan syndrome.

Next,  I need to determine the most appropriate diagnostic test for Marfan syndrome.  Skeletal survey is a key diagnostic tool for Marfan syndrome,  as it can reveal the characteristic features of the skeletal system,  such as genu recurvatum and joint hypermobility.

Therefore,  the most appropriate next step in diagnosis is a skeletal survey.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

Physical examination reveals vague generalized abdominal pain on palpation.  Culture on hektoen enteric agar is positive.  The most likely etiologic agent causing the diarrhea is Choices: a) Clostridium difficile b) Entamoeba histolytica c) Giardia lamblia d) Salmonella typhi 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and clinical presentation.  The patient is a 22 -year-old male with a 5 -day history of diarrhea after completing a course of antibiotics.  The physical examination reveals vague generalized abdominal pain on palpation.
 Next,  I need to consider the culture results.  The culture on hektoen enteric agar is positive.
 Now,  I need to consider the possible etiologic agents.  Clostridium difficile is a common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  Entamoeba histolytica is typically associated with bloody diarrhea and is more common in tropical regions.  Giardia lamblia is usually associated with waterborne transmission.  Salmonella typhi is a cause of typhoid fever, which is not typically associated with antibiotic use.
 Based on the patient's history, clinical presentation, and culture results, the most likely etiologic agent causing the diarrhea is Clostridium difficile.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 15 -year-old male is brought to the office with a 2 -day history of painful swelling over the sacral prominence that began after a fall during a high school wrestling match.  The patient has a low-grade fever.  Examination reveals an erythematous,  fluctuant,  elevated mass with 3  midline pores.  Rectal examination reveals no induration or pain.  The most likely diagnosis is Choices: a) anocutaneous fistula b) coccygodynia c) hidradenitis suppurativa d) pilonidal abscess 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's age,  symptoms,  and physical examination findings.  The patient is 15 years old,  which is consistent with the typical age of onset for hidradenitis suppurativa.  The patient has a painful swelling over the sacral prominence that began after a fall,  which is consistent with a pilonidal abscess.  The patient has a low-grade fever,  which is consistent with the presence of an infection.  The physical examination reveals an erythematous,  fluctuant,  elevated mass with 3 midline pores,  which is consistent with hidradenitis suppurativa.  Rectal examination reveals no induration or pain,  which is consistent with a pilonidal abscess.

Therefore,  the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: You are visiting an 86 -year-old woman in her home at the request of the patient's daughter because of worsening shortness of breath at rest for the past 2  days.  The patient is confined to her home because of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with cor pulmonale.  She was discharged 1  week ago from the hospital following 3  weeks of treatment for pneumonia that required intubation; her hospital stay was complicated by sepsis.  She had a prolonged weaning program from intubation.  Prior to discharge,  the patient and her daughter met with you to review the patient's advance directive.  During the discussion,  the patient said,  ""I'd rather die than be intubated again. "" At that time,  both the patient and her daughter signed an addendum to that effect on the patient's advance directive.  Today,  the patient is dyspneic and is unable to complete a sentence.  Vital signs are temperature 37.8 °C (100.0 °F),  pulse 88 /min,  respirations 35 /min,  and blood pressure 100 /70  mm Hg.  Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 84 % while the patient is breathing 4  L of oxygen.  You ask the patient if she wishes to return to the hospital.  She says,  ""No,  I want to die at home. "" Her daughter takes you aside and says,  ""My mother doesn't know what she's saying.  I insist that she be admitted to the hospital. "" After further discussion with the daughter regarding support available at home,  which of the following is the most appropriate step?  Choices: a) Admit the patient to the hospital b) Arrange for consultation with a home hospice team c) Consult with the hospital ethics committee d) Order a home continuous positive airway pressure machine and instruct the daughter in its use 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's wishes as expressed in her advance directive.  She explicitly stated that she would rather die than be intubated again.  This is a clear directive that should be respected.
 Next,  I need to assess the patient's condition.  She is experiencing worsening shortness of breath,  has a low oxygen saturation despite supplemental oxygen,  and has a history of recent intubation and sepsis.  These factors suggest that she may be experiencing acute decompensation of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with cor pulmonale.
 Now,  I need to consider the daughter's wishes and the support available at home.  The daughter wants the patient admitted to the hospital,  but the patient has expressed her desire to die at home.  The daughter's request may be based on a desire to prolong life at any cost,  which may not be in the patient's best interest.
 To address the daughter's concerns,  I should arrange for consultation with a home hospice team.  This will provide the daughter with information about the support and palliative care options available at home,  allowing her to make an informed decision about her mother's care.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate step is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 37 -year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1 -day history of throbbing facial pain.  She describes the pain as 7  out of 10  in intensity.

"Input: A 42 -year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 10  minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was a restrained passenger.  On arrival,  she has shortness of breath and abdominal pain.  Her pulse is 135 /min,  respirations are 30 /min,  and blood pressure is 80 /40  mm Hg.  Breath sounds are decreased at the left lung base.  An x-ray of the chest shows opacification of the left lower lung field with loss of the diaphragmatic shadow.  Placement of a chest tube yields a small amount of air followed by greenish fluid.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?  Choices: a) CT scan of the abdomen b) CT scan of the chest c) Thoracoscopy d) Laparotomy 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms and the findings on the x-ray.  The patient has shortness of breath,  abdominal pain,  and decreased breath sounds at the left lung base,  along with opacification of the left lower lung field and the presence of air and greenish fluid when a chest tube is placed.  These findings suggest a pneumothorax and possibly a traumatic lung injury.
 Next,  I need to decide on the most appropriate next step in management.  A CT scan of the chest can help confirm the presence of a pneumothorax and provide more information about the extent of the lung injury.  A CT scan of the abdomen may not be as helpful in this case,  as the primary concern is related to the chest.  Thoracoscopy and laparotomy are both invasive procedures and may not be necessary initially,  especially since the patient's primary issue is related to the chest.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate next step in management is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 19 -year-old woman who is a regular patient comes to the office for her annual physical examination and cervical cytology.  She tells you that she has not had a menstrual period for the past 6  months.  She is a college student who is in good health,  has not had any medical illnesses or surgery,  and has never been pregnant.  She is currently sexually active and uses barrier contraception.  She reports that during the past year her menses had become very irregular prior to complete cessation 6  months ago.  She also notes that she has gained about 9  kg (20  lb) in the past 6  months and has had an increasing problem with acne and a troublesome growth of hair on her thighs and abdomen.  She has been somewhat depressed about this,  and her grades have declined.  She reports that one of her sisters also had this problem prior to getting married.  Physical examination shows a mildly obese young woman who has scattered facial acne,  mild male pattern hair growth on the abdomen,  and an essentially normal pelvic examination except for slight enlargement of the uterus and both ovaries.  This patient's history is most consistent with which of the following?  Choices: a) Androgen-producing ovarian tumor b) Cushing syndrome c) Hypothyroidism d) Polycystic ovarian syndrome 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and physical examination findings.  The patient has not had a menstrual period for 6  months,  has gained weight,  has acne,  and has increased hair growth,  all of which are suggestive of hormonal imbalances.
 Next,  I need to consider the differential diagnoses.  Androgen-producing ovarian tumors,  Cushing syndrome,  hypothyroidism,  and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) are all possibilities.
 However,  the patient is a regular patient with no history of thyroid disorders,  so hypothyroidism is less likely.
 Cushing syndrome typically presents with a round face,  buffalo hump,  and thinning hair,  which does not match the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.
 Androgen-producing ovarian tumors are rare and would typically present with more severe symptoms.
 Therefore,  the patient's history is most consistent with polycystic ovarian syndrome,  which is characterized by irregular menstrual periods,  hormonal imbalances,  and the symptoms described.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 44 -year-old female presents to the office for evaluation of a lump on her neck that she noted 1  week ago.  She denies any tenderness,  fever,  weight loss,  or fatigue.  Physical examination reveals a 2 -cm freely movable mass in the lower left lobe of the thyroid.  In addition to thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine levels,  the most appropriate initial method to investigate this lesion is Choices: a) a nuclear thyroid scan b) an iodine131 \xa0 scan c) fine-needle aspiration d) ultrasonography of the thyroid gland 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the characteristics of the lesion.  It is a freely movable mass in the lower left lobe of the thyroid,  and the patient is a 44 -year-old female.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the available diagnostic methods.  A nuclear thyroid scan and an iodine131 scan are both imaging techniques that can show the function of the thyroid gland,  but they are not the first choice for a freely movable mass that may be a cyst or a benign lesion.  Fine-needle aspiration and ultrasonography of the thyroid gland are both imaging techniques,  but fine-needle aspiration is a more direct method to obtain a tissue sample for pathological examination,  which can provide definitive information about the nature of the lesion.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate initial method to investigate this lesion is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 22 -year-old woman comes to the office because of a 3 -day history of cold symptoms and a 1 -week history of progressive fatigue.  Six weeks ago,  she received a kidney transplant from a living,  related donor.  Immediately after the operation,  she received monoclonal anti-CD3  therapy.  Current medications are azathioprine,  cyclosporine,  and prednisone.  Her temperature is 39 °C (102.2 °F).  Physical examination shows a well-healed surgical scar.  Serum studies show that her urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations have tripled.  A diagnosis of allograft rejection is suspected.  In addition,  this patient's clinical presentation is best explained by an infection with which of the following agents?  Choices: a) Adenovirus b) BK virus c) Epstein-Barr virus d) Herpes simplex virus 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and clinical presentation.  She has a kidney transplant,  and her immune system is suppressed to prevent rejection.  Her symptoms include cold symptoms and fatigue,  which are nonspecific but could indicate an infection.  Her elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations suggest impaired kidney function,  which could be due to allograft rejection or infection.

Next,  I need to evaluate the choices for the infectious agent.  Adenovirus is a common cause of respiratory infections,  but it is not specific to kidney transplant patients.  BK virus is a common virus in kidney transplant patients,  but it typically presents with hematuria and does not cause the nonspecific symptoms seen in this patient.  Epstein-Barr virus is a common cause of infectious mononucleosis,  which can cause fatigue,  but it is not specific to kidney transplant patients.  Herpes simplex virus is a common cause of oral and genital herpes,  which can cause cold symptoms and fatigue,  and it is known to infect patients with suppressed immune systems.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 53 -year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6 -month history of intermittent blood in his stool.  He has had no pain with defecation.  Physical examination shows a 1 -cm,  visible anal mass located below the dentate line.  A biopsy of the mass is scheduled.  If the mass if found to be malignant,  it is most appropriate to evaluate which of the following lymph nodes for possible metastasis?  Choices: a) Internal iliac b) Popliteal c) Sacral d) Superficial inguinal 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the location of the mass.  The mass is located below the dentate line,  which means it is in the rectum.
 Next,  I need to consider the lymphatic drainage of the rectum.  The rectum drains into several lymph nodes,  including the internal iliac,  popliteal,  sacral,  and superficial inguinal nodes.
 However,  the most appropriate lymph nodes to evaluate for metastasis from the rectum are the internal iliac nodes.  This is because the rectum is adjacent to the internal ilesocecal valve,  and the internal iliac nodes are the primary drainage nodes for the colon,  which is the adjacent organ.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A study is being conducted to assess mesothelioma in shipyard workers.  A large shipyard firm has provided the asbestos exposure records of all employees during the past 50  years.  The health insurer for the workers has provided claims data that documents all chest x-rays and diagnoses of mesothelioma among current workers and retirees.  The study enrolled shipyard workers who were diagnosed with mesothelioma and shipyard workers who were not diagnosed with mesothelioma.  All subjects in the study had to have chest xrays.  Which of the following is the best rationale for selecting a comparison group that had chest x-rays?  Choices: a) Address confounding b) Demonstrate causality c) Minimize ascertainment bias d) Reduce recall bias 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the purpose of selecting a comparison group that had chest x-rays.  The goal is to ensure that the comparison group is comparable to the mesothelioma group in terms of exposure to asbestos and other risk factors.
 Next,  I need to consider the options provided and how they relate to the selection of a comparison group with chest x-rays.
 a) Confounding refers to variables that affect both the exposure and the outcome, potentially leading to misleading results.  Selecting a comparison group with chest x-rays helps control for confounding by ensuring that both groups have similar exposure histories.
 b) Demonstrating causality requires showing that the exposure (asbestos) causes the outcome (mesothelioma).  Selecting a comparison group with chest x-rays does not directly demonstrate causality, but it helps in controlling for confounding and ascertainment bias.
 c) Ascertainment bias occurs when the process of selecting the comparison group is not random and may lead to biased results.  Selecting a comparison group with chest x-rays helps minimize ascertainment bias by ensuring that both groups have similar exposure histories.
 d) Recall bias occurs when participants' memory of past events affects the accuracy of their responses.  Selecting a comparison group with chest x-rays does not directly address recall bias.

Based on the analysis, the best rationale for selecting a comparison group that had chest x-rays is to address confounding and minimize ascertainment bias. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'ac'}"
"Input: A 34 -year-old woman comes to the office because of a 3 - to 4 -week history of swelling of her legs and a 9 -kg (20 -lb) weight gain.  Medical history is significant for sickle cell trait and mild anemia.  She has been taking 800  mg of ibuprofen three times daily for Achilles tendinitis diagnosed 1  month ago.  She has smoked five cigarettes daily for the past 15  years,  and she drinks one to five beers on weekends.  She experimented with cocaine briefly 16  years ago,  but she has never used intravenous drugs.  She has been in a monogamous sexual relationship for the past 12  years.  Today,  vital signs are temperature 37.2 °C (99.0 °F),  pulse 88 /min,  respirations 16 /min,  and blood pressure 145 /95  mm Hg.  Physical examination discloses periorbital edema but no jugular venous distention.  Lungs are clear to auscultation.  Cardiac examination discloses an S1  and S2  without murmurs or gallops.  Abdominal examination discloses bulging flanks and shifting dullness to percussion.  Examination of the lower extremities shows pitting edema from the mid thigh to the ankles bilaterally.  Results of which of the following studies are most likely to be abnormal in this patient?  Choices: a) HIV antibody study b) Serum B-type natriuretic peptide concentration c) Toxicology screening of the urine d) Urine protein concentration 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation of the patient.  She has swelling of her legs,  periorbular edema,  and a history of weight gain.  These symptoms suggest the possibility of heart failure.
 Next,  I need to consider the most likely causes of heart failure in this patient.  The most common cause of heart failure is ischemic heart disease,  but the patient has no history of smoking or hypertension,  which are risk factors for ischemic heart disease.  The next most common cause of heart failure is valvular heart disease,  but the patient has no history of rheumatic fever or other risk factors for valvular heart disease.  The least common cause of heart failure is diastolic heart disease,  but the patient has no history of diabetes or other risk factors for diastolic heart disease.  The most likely cause of heart failure in this patient is non-ischemic heart failure,  which can be caused by a variety of factors,  including hypertension,  diabetes,  obesity,  and alcohol abuse.
 Now,  I need to consider which of the listed studies are most likely to be abnormal in a patient with non-ischemic heart failure.  a) HIV antibody study is unlikely to be abnormal in a patient with no history of intravenous drug use or other risk factors for HIV infection.  b) Serum B-type natriuretic peptide concentration is likely to be abnormal in a patient with heart failure,  as it is a biomarker for heart failure.  c) Toxicology screening of the urine is unlikely to be abnormal in a patient with no history of cocaine abuse or other illicit drug use.  d) Urine protein concentration is likely to be abnormal in a patient with heart failure,  as it can indicate fluid overload and proteinuria.
 Therefore,  the most likely abnormal studies are b) Serum B-type natriuretic peptide concentration and d) Urine protein concentration.

He reports no change in bowel habits and has not had recent fever,  chills,  or rectal drainage.  He says he and his partner engage in anal-receptive intercourse.  His most recent CD4 + T-lymphocyte count 2  months ago was 350 /mm3  ; HIV viral load at that time was undetectable.  He currently is being treated with antiretroviral therapy.  He has had no opportunistic infections.  Medical history is also significant for syphilis and genital herpes treated with penicillin and acyclovir,  respectively.  He does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcoholic beverages.  Vital signs are normal.  Physical examination shows small bilateral inguinal lymph nodes,  but respiratory,  cardiac,  and abdominal examinations disclose no abnormalities.  There are several tender fleshy lesions around the perianal area.  Rectal examination produces tenderness,  but there is no rectal discharge.  Test of the stool for occult blood is trace positive.  Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time?  Choices: a) Acyclovir b) Imiquimod c) Levofloxacin d) Metronidazole 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and history.  The patient presents with anal pain,  blood on toilet tissue,  and tender fleshy lesions around the perianal area.  These symptoms are consistent with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection,  a common cause of anal warts and related symptoms.  Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections,  not HPV.  Imiquimod is an immune response modifier used to treat skin conditions,  not HPV.  Levofloxacin is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections,  not viral infections like HPV.  Metronidazole is an antibiotic used to treat protozoan infections,  not viral infections like HPV.  Therefore,  the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time is not among the choices provided.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'None of the above'}"
"Input: A 71 -year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her daughter for evaluation of her mental status.  The daughter says,  ""I visited Mom today for the first time in 6  months; her memory has worsened,  her bills are unpaid,  and her house is unusually messy. "" The patient says,  ""I'm perfectly healthy. "" Medical history is significant for hypertension diagnosed more than 25  years ago,  and two small strokes occurring 3  years and 7  months ago.  The daughter gives you three empty medicine bottles from her mother's home: metoprolol,  hydrochlorothiazide,  and aspirin.  The patient is 165  cm (5  ft 5  in) tall and weighs 59  kg (130  lb); BMI is 22  kg/m2  .  Vital signs are temperature 36.4 °C (97.6 °F),  pulse 76 /min,  respirations 16 /min,  and blood pressure 196 /112  mm Hg.  Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 93 %.  Muscle strength in her left hand is 1 /5.  Strength in the right extremities is 4 /5.  The patient is oriented only to self; she does not know the day of the week or today's date.  She recalls 0  of 3  words at 5  minutes,  and she is unable to name 2  objects,  correctly draw interlocking pentagons,  or count backwards by serial sevens.  Complete blood count,  renal function studies,  liver function studies,  and urinalysis are all within the reference ranges.  ECG shows no abnormalities.  Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms?  Choices: a) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis b) Cortical basal ganglionic degeneration c) Neurosyphilis d) Vascular dementia 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's medical history and symptoms.  The patient has a history of hypertension and two small strokes,  which suggests a vascular cause for her symptoms.  The daughter mentioned that the patient's memory has worsened,  and the patient herself is unaware of her cognitive decline,  which is consistent with a dementia diagnosis.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the other options.  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive motor neuron disease that primarily affects movement,  and the patient's symptoms do not align with this diagnosis.  Cortical basal ganglionic degeneration is a rare disorder that affects movement and cognition,  but the patient's symptoms are not specific enough to support this diagnosis.  Neurosyphilis is a rare condition caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum,  and the patient's symptoms do not align with this diagnosis.
 Therefore,  the most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms is d) Vascular dementia.

"Input: A 17 -year-old girl has never had a menstrual period.  Physical examination shows a normal female body habitus,  normal breast development,  and normal appearing external genitalia.  She has no axillary or pubic hair.  The patient refuses to have a pelvic or rectal examination.  Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the clinical presentation?  Choices: a) Androgen insensitivity b) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia c) Ectodermal dysplasia d) A psychiatric disorder 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation.  The patient is 17  years old and has never had a menstrual period,  which indicates that she is not ovulating.  She has normal female body habitus,  normal breast development,  and normal appearing external genitalia,  but no axillary or pubic hair.
 Next,  I can eliminate some of the choices.  Ectodermal dysplasia is a genetic disorder that affects the development of the hair, teeth, and nails,  but it does not cause the absence of menstrual periods.  A psychiatric disorder is not a medical explanation for the absence of menstrual periods.
 Now,  I need to consider the remaining choices.  Androgen insensitivity is a condition where a person with XY chromosomes is unable to respond to androgens,  leading to a lack of typical male or female sexual characteristics.  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a group of inherited genetic disorders that affect the adrenal glands,  leading to an imbalance in sex hormones.
 The most likely explanation for the clinical presentation is androgen insensitivity,  as it explains the absence of menstrual periods,  normal female external genitalia,  and lack of secondary sexual characteristics.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 68 -year-old female presents to the emergency department with a 3 -day history of worsening fever and headache.  Today the patient is nauseated and less responsive.

The most likely etiologic organism is Choices: a) Clostridium perfringens b) Haemophilus influenzae c) rhinovirus d) Streptococcus pneumoniae 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation and the results of the lumbar puncture.  The patient is a 68 -year-old female with a 3 -day history of worsening fever, headache, and today she is nauseated and less responsive.  The lumbar puncture reveals a protein level of 89 mg/dL, which is outside the reference range, and pleocytosis.

Next,  I need to consider the etiologic organisms listed.  Clostridium perfringens is a gram-positive bacterium that can cause gas gangrene and is not typically associated with meningitis in this age group.  Haemophilus influenzae is a gram-negative bacterium that can cause meningitis, but it is less common in older adults.  Rhinovirus is a virus that can cause respiratory infections, but it is not typically associated with meningitis.  Streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram-positive bacterium that can cause meningitis, especially in older adults, and is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia.

Considering the clinical presentation and the results of the lumbar puncture,  the most likely etiologic organism is Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

 First,  I need to identify the viscera involved in this patient's condition.  The patient presents with symptoms of diarrhea and constipation,  which are related to the gastrointestinal system.
 Next,  I need to determine where the sympathetic innervation for the gastrointestinal system originates.  The sympathetic innervation for the gastrointestinal system is derived from the T7 to L2 spinal nerve roots.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 33 -year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2 -day history of mild nausea,  increased urinary urgency and frequency,  and constipation.  She also has had a 4.5 -kg (10 -lb) weight loss during the past 2  weeks and a 3 -week history of vaginal bleeding.  Pelvic examination shows a nodular cervix with an irregular,  friable posterior lip,  and a rock-hard,  irregular,  immobile pelvic mass that extends across the pelvis.  Examination of biopsy specimens from the cervix and anterior wall of the vagina show well-differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.  Which of the following best describes the pathogenesis of this patient's disease?  Choices: a) Inactivation of cellular p53  b) Insertion of viral promotors adjacent to cellular growth factor genes c) Specialized transduction d) Transactivation of cellular growth factor genes by TAX 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the clinical presentation and the pathology findings.  The patient has a history of nausea,  increased urinary urgency and frequency,  constipation,  weight loss,  and vaginal bleeding.  The physical examination findings are a nodular cervix with an irregular,  friable posterior lip,  and a rock-hard,  irregular,  immobile pelvic mass that extends across the pelvis.  The biopsy specimens show well-differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.

Next,  I need to consider the pathogenesis of cervical cancer.  Cervical cancer is often associated with the human papillomavirus (HPV) infection,  which can lead to the inactivation of cellular p53,  insertion of viral promotors adjacent to cellular growth factor genes,  specialized transduction,  or transactivation of cellular growth factor genes by TAX.

Finally,  I need to determine which of the choices best describes the pathogenesis of this patient's disease.  The patient has well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma,  which is commonly associated with high-risk HPV infections.  The presence of TAX protein,  which is overexpressed in many HPV-associated cancers,  can lead to transactivation of cellular growth factor genes.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 52 -year-old woman has had dyspnea and hemoptysis for 1  month.  She has a history of rheumatic fever as a child and has had a cardiac murmur since early adulthood.  Her temperature is 36.7 °C (98 °F),  pulse is 130 /min and irregularly irregular,  respirations are 20 /min,  and blood pressure is 98 /60  mm Hg.  Jugular venous pressure is not increased.  Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases.  There is an opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur at the third left intercostal space.  An x-ray of the chest shows left atrial enlargement,  a straight left cardiac border,  and pulmonary venous engorgement.  Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?  Choices: a) Aortic valve insufficiency b) Aortic valve stenosis c) Mitral valve insufficiency d) Mitral valve stenosis 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and symptoms.  She has had dyspnea and hemoptysis for 1  month,  which are common symptoms of congestive heart failure.  She has a history of rheumatic fever as a child,  which can lead to valve damage.  Her cardiac examination findings include an irregularly irregular pulse, bilateral crackles at the lung bases, and an opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur at the third left intercostal space.  These findings are suggestive of valvular heart disease.
 Next,  I need to consider the specific findings on the chest x-ray.  The left atrium is enlarged,  the left cardiac border is straight,  and pulmonary venous engorgement is present.  These findings are consistent with mitral valve disease,  as they can result from mitral valve insufficiency or stenosis.
 Finally,  I need to consider the specific findings on the cardiac examination.  The opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur at the third left intercostal space is a characteristic finding of mitral valve stenosis.  Mitral valve insufficiency would not produce an opening snap.
 Therefore,  the most likely explanation for these findings is mitral valve stenosis,  so the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 16 -month-old girl is brought to the emergency department by emergency medical technicians because of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure that began 25  minutes ago and has continued despite administration of 0.5  mg/kg rectal diazepam 10  minutes ago.  The patient was at home at the time of the seizure.  In the emergency department,  she is given an additional 0.5  mg/kg dose of diazepam intravenously and the convulsion terminates.  Within 2  minutes,  her oxygen saturation drops to 75 % and she appears cyanotic.  Respirations are 10 /min and shallow.  She receives bag-valve-mask ventilation,  followed by intubation and mechanical ventilation.  Medical history is unremarkable.  She takes no medications.  Temperature is 39.1 °C (102.5 °F).  Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's respiratory insufficiency?  Choices: a) Airway occlusion b) Encephalitis c) Medication-induced suppression of central respiratory drive d) Meningitis 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation and the history of the patient.  The patient had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure that was not controlled by diazepam,  followed by respiratory insufficiency.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the possible causes of respiratory insufficiency.  Airway occlusion is a possible cause,  but it is less likely because the patient received bag-valve-mask ventilation and then intubation and mechanical ventilation,  indicating that the airway was not completely obstructed.
 Encephalitis and meningitis can cause respiratory insufficiency,  but they are less likely in this case because the medical history is unremarkable and there is no mention of fever or other signs of infection.
 Medication-induced suppression of central respiratory drive is a possible cause,  especially considering that the patient received two doses of diazepam,  a potent sedative and muscle relaxant.
 Therefore,  the most likely underlying cause of the patient's respiratory insufficiency is medication-induced suppression of central respiratory drive.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

"Input: A 55 -year-old man has had crushing substernal chest pain on exertion over the past 6  weeks.  He had a myocardial infarction 2  months ago.  He takes nitroglycerin as needed and one aspirin daily.  He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 30  years.  Examination shows normal heart sounds and no carotid or femoral bruits.  Treatment with a β-adrenergic blocking agent is most likely to improve his symptoms due to which of the following mechanisms?  Choices: a) Decreasing myocardial contractility b) Dilating the coronary arteries c) Peripheral vasodilation d) Preventing fibrin and platelet plugs 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and symptoms.  The patient is a 55 -year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction and smoking two packs of cigarettes daily for 30  years.  He presents with crushing substernal chest pain on exertion,  which is a classic presentation for angina pectoris.
 Next,  I need to consider the treatment options and their mechanisms of action.  A β-adrenergic blocking agent,  such as metoprolol,  works by blocking the action of epinephrine (adrenaline) on the heart and blood vessels.  This has several effects,  including decreasing myocardial contractility,  dilating the coronary arteries,  peripheral vasodilation,  and preventing fibrin and platelet plugs.
 Now,  I need to determine which mechanism is most likely to improve the patient's symptoms.  Decreasing myocardial contractility (a) may help reduce the demand for oxygen by the heart,  which could alleviate the chest pain.  Dilating the coronary arteries (b) would also improve blood flow to the heart muscle and could help alleviate the pain.  Peripheral vasodilation (c) would increase blood flow to the rest of the body,  but is less directly related to the patient's symptoms.  Preventing fibrin and platelet plugs (d) would help prevent future myocardial infarctions,  but is not the primary mechanism by which β-adrenergic blocking agents improve angina symptoms.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 78 -year-old man,  who underwent coronary angiography with stent placement 8  years ago,  comes to the office for a routine health maintenance examination.  The patient reports no new symptoms except for shortness of breath and fatigue during exercise that began 3  months ago when he tried to increase the distance of his daily walk from 1  mile to 3  miles.  He has not had orthopnea,  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,  or chest pain.  Additional medical history is significant for hypertension,  coronary artery disease,  dyslipidemia,  and polymyalgia rheumatica.  The patient also has a heart murmur that was discovered at an armed forces screening physical examination at age 18  years,  but it did not prevent him from serving in the military.  Medications are metoprolol,  atorvastatin,  lisinopril,  omeprazole,  and a low dose of prednisone every other day.  The patient is active and manages a small farm.  BMI is 26  kg/m2  .  Vital signs are temperature 37.0 °C (98.6 °F),  pulse 60 /min,  respirations 18 /min,  and blood pressure 124 /61  mm Hg.  Cardiac examination discloses a normal S1,  pronounced S2,  and a grade 2 /6  late systolic murmur heard at the right upper parasternal border.  Pulses are normal in contour.  Results of laboratory studies are within the reference ranges.  ECG shows no abnormalities.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?  Choices: a) Decrease the dose of metoprolol b) Increase the dose of prednisone c) Obtain serum vitamin D concentration d) Order a transthoracic echocardiography 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.  The patient reports shortness of breath and fatigue during exercise,  and there is a grade 2/6 late systolic murmur on cardiac examination.  These findings suggest the possibility of valvular heart disease,  such as mitral regurgitation or aortic regurgitation.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the most appropriate diagnostic test to confirm the diagnosis.  Among the choices,  transthoracic echocardiography is the most sensitive and specific test for valvular heart disease.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate next step in management is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 70 -year-old woman comes to the office because of worsening tremor of her hands.  The tremor has been present for most of her life and initially was mild and would occur only when she was tired or stressed.  During the past month the shaking has become more noticeable and frequent.  She is now embarrassed to eat with other people because of how obvious the tremor has become.  The patient has been taking fluoxetine for the past 3  weeks to help her to cope with the death of her husband 2  months ago.  Medical history is also remarkable for essential hypertension controlled with lisinopril and hyperlipidemia controlled with atorvastatin.  Her only other medication is occasional ibuprofen for joint pain.  She used to drink one to two alcoholic beverages monthly but now drinks one glass of wine daily because,  she says,  it reduces her tremor.  She is 168  cm (5  ft 6  in) tall and weighs 70  kg (155  lb); BMI is 25  kg/m2  .  Vital signs are temperature 36.4 °C (97.6 °F),  pulse 80 /min,  respirations 18 /min,  and blood pressure 130 /85  mm Hg.  Physical examination shows a moderate tremor of both hands that is not present at rest.  Complete blood count,  serum chemistry profile,  and serum thyroid function tests are ordered and results are pending.  Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's worsening tremor?  Choices: a) Adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy b) Bereavement reaction c) Early Parkinson disease d) Increase in alcohol consumption 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the history of the patient's tremor.  It has been present for most of her life and initially was mild and would occur only when she was tired or stressed.  However,  during the past month,  the shaking has become more noticeable and frequent.  This progression suggests that the tremor is not stable and may be getting worse.
 Next,  I need to consider the medications the patient is taking.  She is taking fluoxetine for depression,  which can cause a movement disorder known as dyskinesia,  which can manifest as a tremor.  She also drinks one glass of wine daily,  which can reduce her tremor.  However,  the tremor has become more noticeable and frequent during the past month,  which could be related to the increase in alcohol consumption.
 The patient also experienced the death of her husband 2  months ago,  which could cause a bereavement reaction,  but this is less likely because the tremor has been present for most of her life and has been getting worse.
 Finally,  I need to consider the physical examination findings.  The patient has a moderate tremor of both hands that is not present at rest.  This is consistent with a movement disorder.
 Based on the history,  medications,  and physical examination findings,  the most likely cause of the patient's worsening tremor is the adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the possible causes of lower abdominal pain and fever in this patient.  The patient has a history of frequent unprotected sexual intercourse,  which increases the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
 Next,  I need to consider the symptoms and examination findings.  Suprapubic tenderness and more intense tenderness on bimanual examination of the uterus suggest an infection involving the genital tract.
 Now,  I need to consider the available choices for antimicrobial chemotherapy.  Each choice includes two microorganisms that could potentially cause the patient's symptoms.
 To determine the most appropriate treatment,  I should consider the most common STIs in this patient's age group and the symptoms they typically present with.  Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are common STIs in young adults and can cause lower abdominal pain and fever.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

"Input: A 15 -year-old girl is brought to the physician 3  months after she had a blood pressure of 150 /95  mm Hg at a routine examination prior to participation in school sports.  She is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness.  Twelve months ago,  she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.  She currently takes no medications.  Subsequent blood pressure measurements on three separate occasions since the last visit have been: 155 /94  mm Hg,  145 /90  mm Hg,  and 150 /92  mm Hg.  She is at the 50 th percentile for height and 95 th percentile for weight.  Her blood pressure today is 150 /90  mm Hg confirmed by a second measurement,  pulse is 80 /min,  and respirations are 12 /min.  Examination shows no other abnormalities.  Her hematocrit is 40 %.  Urinalysis is within normal limits.  Cardiac and renal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?  Choices: a) Exercise and weight reduction program b) Measurement of urine catecholamine concentrations c) Measurement of urine corticosteroid concentrations d) Captopril therapy 
 Output:
 First,  I need to assess the girl's current blood pressure status.  She has had multiple blood pressure readings in the past 12  months,  with the most recent reading being 150 /90  mm Hg.  This is above the normal range for a 15 -year-old,  indicating stage 1 hypertension.
 Next,  I need to consider the possible causes of her hypertension.  She has a history of a urinary tract infection treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,  but no history of serious illness or other risk factors for hypertension.  Her height is at the 50 th percentile,  but her weight is at the 95 th percentile,  suggesting obesity as a contributing factor.  Her hematocrit is also elevated at 40 %,  which could indicate anemia or other underlying conditions.
 Considering the possible causes,  the most appropriate next step in management would be to address the obesity and anemia.  Exercise and weight reduction program (a) would be the most appropriate option to manage obesity,  and addressing the elevated hematocrit through further evaluation and potential treatment of anemia or other underlying conditions would be important.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate next step in management is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A previously healthy 14 -year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 2 -day history of fever and pain and swelling of the right knee.  She remembers injuring the knee while playing soccer last week,  but she was able to finish the game.  She has no history of rash or joint pain.  Her sister has inflammatory bowel disease.  The patient's temperature is 39 °C (102.2 °F),  blood pressure is 110 /80  mm Hg,  pulse is 95 /min,  and respirations are 20 /min.  Examination of the right knee shows swelling,  tenderness,  warmth,  and erythema; range of motion is limited.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?  Choices: a) Nuclear scan of the right knee b) MRI of the right knee c) Antibiotic therapy d) Arthrocentesis 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation and differential diagnoses.  The patient has a recent history of knee injury,  fever,  and signs of inflammation in the knee.  Possible diagnoses include septic arthritis,  gout,  and acute rheumatic fever.  However,  the presence of a sister with inflammatory bowel disease suggests a higher likelihood of septic arthritis due to gram -negative bacteria.
 Next,  I need to consider the appropriate diagnostic tests.  Nuclear scan and MRI are imaging modalities that can help visualize the joint but are not definitive for diagnosing septic arthritis.  Antibiotic therapy can be started empirically while waiting for diagnostic results,  but it is not the most appropriate next step without confirming the diagnosis.
 The most appropriate next step in management is to perform an arthrocentesis,  which involves withdrawing synovial fluid from the joint for analysis.  This test can help confirm the diagnosis of septic arthritis by identifying the presence of infectious agents in the synovial fluid.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 14 -year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 2 -day history of a sore throat and fever that peaks in the late afternoon.  He also has a 1 -week history of progressive fatigue.  He recently began having unprotected sexual intercourse with one partner.  He appears ill.  His temperature is 39 °C (102.2 °F).  Physical examination shows cervical lymphadenopathy and pharyngeal erythema with a creamy exudate.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  Choices: a) Candidiasis b) Herpangina c) Infectious mononucleosis d) Mumps 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and physical examination findings.  The patient has a sore throat,  fever that peaks in the late afternoon,  progressive fatigue,  cervical lymphadenopathy,  and pharyngeal erythema with a creamy exudate.
 Next,  I need to consider the risk factors.  The patient recently began having unprotected sexual intercourse with one partner.
 Finally,  I need to compare the findings to the diagnostic criteria for each option.  Candidiasis is unlikely because it typically presents with a non-ulcerative oral or pharyngeal lesion and does not cause fever that peaks in the late afternoon.  Herpangina is possible but less likely because it usually presents in children under 5 years of age and does not typically cause cervical lymphadenopathy.  Infectious mononucleosis is a strong possibility because it typically presents with fever that peaks in the late afternoon,  progressive fatigue,  and pharyngeal exudate,  and the patient's sexual risk factor is consistent with the mode of transmission.  Mumps is unlikely because it typically presents with a unilateral tender mass in the anterior or posterior axillary line,  and does not cause fever that peaks in the late afternoon.
 Based on the patient's symptoms,  physical examination findings,  and risk factors,  the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 1 -year-old male is brought to the emergency department with blistered fresh burns over his hands and feet in a stocking and glove distribution.  His mother reports that he was accidentally burned when he turned on the hot water in the bathtub while she was answering the telephone in the bedroom.  In addition to debridement of the burns,  pain management,  a thorough history and physical examination,  and baseline laboratory studies,  the most appropriate next step is to Choices: a) administer a 5 % albumin infusion b) administer intravenous steroids c) contact child protective services d) discharge the patient home with his parents 
 Output:
 First,  I need to assess the severity of the burns.  The stocking and glove distribution indicates that the burns are partial-thickness burns,  which are second-degree burns.
 Next,  I need to consider the patient's age and the circumstances of the injury.  The patient is 1 year old,  and the injury was accidental.
 The most appropriate next step is to contact child protective services,  as the child was left unattended and there is a risk of future harm.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 42 -year-old man comes to the physician because of malaise,  muscle and joint pain,  and temperatures to 38.4 °C (101.1 °F) for 3  days.  Three months ago,  he underwent cadaveric renal transplantation resulting in immediate kidney function.  At the time of discharge,  his serum creatinine concentration was 0.8  mg/dL.  He is receiving cyclosporine and corticosteroids.  Examination shows no abnormalities.  His leukocyte count is 2700 /mm3  ,  and serum creatinine concentration is 1.6  mg/dL; serum cyclosporine concentration is in the therapeutic range.  A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows intracellular inclusion bodies.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?  Choices: a) Increase the dosage of corticosteroids b) Increase the dosage of cyclosporine c) Begin amphotericin therapy d) Begin ganciclovir therapy 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the cause of the symptoms and elevated serum creatinine concentration.  The biopsy results show intracellular inclusion bodies,  which is a characteristic finding of cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity.
 Next,  I need to determine the appropriate management based on the cause.  In this case,  the most appropriate next step is to adjust the cyclosporine dosage,  since the patient is already on corticosteroids and the serum cyclosporine concentration is in the therapeutic range.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: During a clinical study examining the effects of exercise,  men between the ages of 20  and 30  years are evaluated during a 15 - minute session on a treadmill.  The average pulse for the last 2  minutes of the session is 175 /min.  During the last minute of exercise,  various measurements are taken.  Compared with the measurement before the session,  which of the following is most likely to be decreased?  Choices: a) Pulse pressure b) Stroke volume c) Systolic blood pressure d) Total peripheral resistance 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the study.  The study is examining the effects of exercise on the cardiovascular system.
 Next,  I need to consider the measurements taken during the last minute of exercise.  The average pulse for the last 2  minutes of the session is 175 /min,  which means the heart rate is high.
 Now,  I need to consider the choices given and how exercise might affect them.  Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure.  Stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped by the heart per beat.  Systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries when the heart contracts.  Total peripheral resistance is the resistance to blood flow in the circulatory system.
 During exercise,  the heart rate increases,  which means the heart is pumping more blood per minute.  This can lead to a decrease in stroke volume as the heart tries to pump more blood with each beat.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

Neurologic examination shows no focal findings.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  Choices: a) Cluster headache b) Meningitis c) Migraine d) Subarachnoid hemorrhage 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the sudden onset of a severe occipital headache and stiff neck.  This is a classic presentation of a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 Next,  the patient has hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease,  which are risk factors for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 The patient is oriented to person,  place,  and time,  which is consistent with a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 The neurologic examination shows no focal findings,  which is also consistent with a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 The other options,  such as cluster headache,  meningitis,  and migraine,  do not fit the presentation as well.
 Therefore,  the most likely diagnosis is subarachnoid hemorrhage,  which corresponds to {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 10 -year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because her school nurse thinks that she may have Marfan syndrome.  She is at the 95 th percentile for height and 25 th percentile for weight.  Physical examination shows a narrow palate with dental crowding,  long slender extremities,  and joint laxity.  Molecular testing for FBN1  shows a single nucleotide difference that does not change the amino acid at that locus.  Her mother is 163  cm (5  ft 4  in) tall.  There is no clinical evidence of Marfan syndrome in the mother,  but she has the same single nucleotide change as the patient.  The same nucleotide change is found in 15  of 200  individuals without Marfan syndrome.  Which of the following best describes the single nucleotide change in the patient and her mother?  Choices: a) It is a disease-causing mutation in the patient and her mother b) It is a polymorphism c) It is a sequence variant of unknown significance d) It will change the folding of the protein 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation of the patient and her mother.  The patient has Marfan syndrome symptoms,  such as a narrow palate,  dental crowding,  long slender extremities,  and joint laxity.  Her mother has the same single nucleotide change as the patient,  but there is no clinical evidence of Marfan syndrome in her.
 Next,  I need to consider the molecular testing results.  The single nucleotide change does not change the amino acid at that locus,  so it is not likely to change the folding of the protein.  Additionally,  the same nucleotide change is found in 15  of 200  individuals without Marfan syndrome,  which suggests that it is a common genetic variation.
 Based on these considerations,  the best description of the single nucleotide change in the patient and her mother is that it is a sequence variant of unknown significance.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 50 -year-old woman comes to the office for the first time because of recurrent abdominal pain.  Review of her extensive medical chart,  which she has brought with her,  discloses that she has a long history of varying physical symptoms.  Definitive causes for these symptoms have not been found despite extensive diagnostic studies,  consultations with many physicians,  and several surgical explorations.

"Input: A 5 -year-old boy returns to the office with his 19 -year-old mother to discuss results of studies done to evaluate his behavior of eating dirt.  The patient sits quietly while his mother answers questions about his health.  She says her son seems healthy,  although he does not seem to be as active as other children his age.  He has said his head hurts three or four times during the past 2  weeks.  He has not had fever,  sweats,  or chills.  She says he has a good appetite but has had a habit of eating sand and dirt since age 3  years.  She says,  ""I don't know where he gets that habit.  I used to eat dirt,  but I stopped years ago.  I try to stop him from eating dirt,  but I'm not around much since I work two jobs. "" The patient takes no medications.  Vaccinations are upto-date.  Height,  weight,  and BMI are at the 50 th percentile.  Vital signs are normal.  Physical examination discloses no abnormalities except for symmetrical nontender cervical adenopathy.  Results of laboratory studies,  including serum zinc,  lead,  and iron concentrations,  are within the reference ranges.  Serologic testing confirms toxoplasmosis.  In addition to prescribing pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine therapy,  which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?  Choices: a) Prescribe fluoxetine b) Prescribe methylphenidate c) Prescribe risperidone d) Refer the patient to a child psychiatrist 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the underlying cause of the patient's behavior of eating dirt.  The physical examination and laboratory studies,  including serologic testing,  have revealed toxoplasmosis.  This suggests that the patient may have a gastrointestinal infection that is causing him to eat dirt.
 Next,  I need to consider the appropriate treatment for toxoplasmosis.  The given choices include pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine therapy,  which are appropriate for treating toxoplasmosis.
 Finally,  I need to consider the patient's other symptoms and concerns.  The patient has a history of headaches,  but no fever,  sweats,  or chills.  He has a good appetite and normal height,  weight,  and BMI.  The physical examination discloses symmetrical nontender cervical adenopathy,  which may be related to the toxoplasmosis.
 Based on these considerations,  the most appropriate next step in management is to prescribe pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine therapy for the toxoplasmosis and to monitor the patient's response to the treatment.  The other choices,  such as prescribing fluoxetine,  methylphenidate,  or risperidone,  are not appropriate for treating toxoplasmosis or addressing the patient's behavior of eating dirt.

"Input: A 32 -year-old man and his 29 -year-old wife come to the office for evaluation for infertility.  The wife's gynecologist has reported that her anatomic and physiologic evaluation disclosed no abnormalities and that assessment of potential male factors is needed.  The husband is 188  cm (6  ft 3  in) tall with fair skin and little facial hair.  He has mild gynecomastia and small,  firm testicles.  No sperm are seen on semen analysis.  Which of the following tests is most likely to establish the underlying cause of this couple's infertility?  Choices: a) Karyotype from peripheral leukocytes b) Serum estrogen and testosterone concentrations c) Serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations d) Serum prolactin concentration 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and test results presented.  The husband has mild gynecomastia,  small testicles,  and no sperm on semen analysis.  These findings suggest a problem with testicular function.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the available test choices.  a) Karyotype from peripheral leukocytes is used to check for chromosomal abnormalities,  which is not relevant to the presented symptoms.  b) Serum estrogen and testosterone concentrations could help identify a hormonal imbalance,  but the symptoms are more suggestive of a problem with sperm production rather than hormonal levels.  c) Serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations are important for assessing the function of the pituitary gland and the response of the testes to luteinizing hormone,  which could help identify issues with sperm production.  d) Serum prolactin concentration is used to check for issues with the hypothalama-pituitary axis,  which could affect the production of gonadotropins and,  in turn,  sperm production.
 Based on the presented symptoms and the relevance of each test,  the most likely test to establish the underlying cause of this couple's infertility is c) Serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations.

"Input: A 28 -year-old man comes to the office because he would like to quit smoking cigarettes.  He says,  ""I cannot go more than a day without cigarettes because I get so anxious and irritable.  I even wake up at night to smoke. "" The patient began smoking cigarettes at age 12  years; he was smoking two packs of cigarettes daily by age 17  years,  and he has not curtailed his use since that time.  He does not drink alcoholic beverages or use illicit drugs.  Medical history is remarkable for childhood febrile seizures.  He takes no medications.  Vital signs are normal.  The patient is interested in using a nicotine patch and bupropion therapy because he says his friend found the treatments to be helpful.  In combining these two therapies,  this patient is at greatest risk for which of the following?  Choices: a) Hypertension b) Polyuria c) Renal insufficiency d) The patient is at no increased risk 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the medications the patient is interested in using: nicotine patch and bupropion.  Nicotine patches are used to help people quit smoking by providing a controlled amount of nicotine,  which helps to reduce withdrawal symptoms.  Bupropion is an antidepressant that is also used to help people quit smoking; it works by reducing the urge to smoke and increasing the ability to resist cravings.
 Bupropion is known to cause an increase in urination (polyuria) as a side effect,  because it inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine,  which can lead to an increase in these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 40 -year-old male presents to the office with symptoms of odynophagia and gastroesophageal reflux.  He also says that he experienced hematemesis once last week.  Past medical history reveals AIDS,  and his most recent CD4  count was 30  cells/mcL.  The patient's tilt test result and hemoglobin level are normal.  Rectal examination demonstrates brown stool that is positive for occult blood.  What is the most appropriate initial step in this patient's management?  Choices: a) prescription for a proton pump inhibitor and a prokinetic agent b) prescription for an H2 -blocker trial for 6  weeks c) prescription for clotrimazole troches d) referral for an upper endoscopy with biopsy 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's symptoms and history.  Odynophagia,  gastroesophageal reflux,  and hematemesis are suggestive of gastroesophageal varices.  The patient's AIDS and low CD4 count further increase the risk of variceal bleeding.  The patient's normal hemoglobin level and occult blood in stool support this diagnosis.
 Next,  I need to consider the available options.  Prescription of a proton pump inhibitor and a prokinetic agent (a) may help reduce gastric acidity and improve esophageal motility,  but they do not address the underlying cause of variceal bleeding.  Prescription of an H2 -blocker trial for 6  weeks (b) may also help reduce gastric acidity,  but it does not address the underlying cause of variceal bleeding either.  Prescription of clotrimazole troches (c) is not relevant to the management of gastroesophageal varices or variceal bleeding.  Referral for an upper endoscopy with biopsy (d) is the most appropriate initial step because it can confirm the diagnosis of gastroesophageal varices,  determine the extent of the disease,  and assess the need for endoscopic therapy or other interventions.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 55 -year-old man comes to the physician for a routine physical examination.  He is currently taking no medications.  His pulse is 80 /min,  and blood pressure is 165 /95  mm Hg.  Physical examination shows no other abnormalities.  The presence of which of the following mechanisms is most likely to increase this patient's blood pressure further?  Choices: a) Decreased cardiac output b) Decreased pulse c) Decreased stroke volume d) Increased peripheral vascular resistance 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the factors that can increase blood pressure.  Increased peripheral vascular resistance is one of the mechanisms that can lead to higher blood pressure.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the other options.  Decreased cardiac output,  decreased pulse,  and decreased stroke volume are not likely to increase blood pressure further.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 54 -year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination 10  days after undergoing a stereotactic brain operation to remove a small tumor.  The operation was successful.  During the procedure,  he was under conscious sedation.  The patient recalls that at one point during the operation he experienced a sudden,  intense feeling of overwhelming fear.  Which of the following areas of the brain was most likely stimulated at that time?  Choices: a) Amygdala b) Hippocampus c) Mammillary body d) Prefrontal cortex 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider which brain area is responsible for processing emotions,  especially fear.  The amygdala is known to be the primary emotional center in the brain,  responsible for processing emotions,  including fear.
 Next,  I need to consider which area of the brain is involved in memory and learning.  The hippocampus is the primary area of the brain involved in memory and learning.
 Then,  I need to consider the role of the mammillary body.  The mammillary body is part of the hypothalamus and is involved in memory processing,  but it is not the primary area for processing emotions.
 Finally,  I need to consider the prefrontal cortex.  The prefrontal cortex is involved in executive functions,  such as decision-making,  planning,  and impulse control,  but it is not primarily responsible for processing emotions.
 Based on the information provided,  the patient experienced a sudden,  intense feeling of overwhelming fear during the operation.  This suggests that the area of the brain stimulated was most likely responsible for processing emotions.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 5 -year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 2 -day history of fever and painful swelling of the left ankle.  He has had recurrent cervical lymphadenitis and pneumonia since infancy.  Two years ago,  a culture from an abscess in the cervical region grew Staphylococcus aureus.  His temperature is 38 °C (100.4 °F).  Examination shows a tender,  erythematous,  edematous left ankle; there is point tenderness over the medial malleolus.  A bone scan shows increased uptake in the left lower tibial metaphysis.  Culture of bone aspirate grows Serratia marcescens.  Nitroblue tetrazolium test shows no color change.  Which of the following is the most likely mechanism for these findings?  Choices: a) Developmental arrest of maturation of B lymphocytes b) Dysmorphogenesis of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches c) Impaired chemotaxis d) Impaired phagocytic oxidative metabolism 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation and laboratory findings.  The patient has recurrent infections,  including a previous culture of Staphylococcus aureus,  and now presents with a swollen ankle that is tender,  erythematous,  and edematous.  The bone scan shows increased uptake in the left lower tibial metaphysis,  and the culture of the bone aspirate grows Serratia marcescens.  The nitroblue tetrazolium test shows no color change.

Next,  I need to consider the possible mechanisms that could explain these findings.  Option a) Developmental arrest of maturation of B lymphocytes is not likely,  as this would not explain the recurrent infections or the specific pathogen identified in the bone aspirate.  Option b) Dysmorphogenesis of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches is not relevant to the clinical presentation or laboratory findings.  Option c) Impaired chemotaxis could be a possible mechanism,  as chemotaxis is important for the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection.  Option d) Impaired phagocytic oxidative metabolism is the most likely mechanism,  as it would explain the recurrent infections and the specific pathogen identified in the bone aspirate.  Serratia marcescens is an oxidase-negative bacterium,  which means it is not susceptible to the nitroblue tetrazolium test,  as shown in the laboratory findings.

Therefore,  the most likely mechanism for these findings is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A placebo-controlled clinical trial is conducted to assess whether a new antihypertensive drug is more effective than standard therapy.  A total of 5000  patients with essential hypertension are enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two groups: 2500  patients receive the new drug and 2500  patients receive placebo.  If the alpha is set at 0.01  instead of 0.05,  which of the following is the most likely result?  Choices: a) Significant findings can be reported with greater confidence b) The study will have more power c) There is a decreased likelihood of a Type II error d) There is an increased likelihood of statistically significant findings 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of alpha in a clinical trial.  Alpha represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true,  which corresponds to a Type I error.  Setting alpha at 0.01  compares to a stricter threshold than setting it at 0.05.
 Next,  I need to consider the impact of changing the alpha level on the study's power.  Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false,  which is the opposite of a Type II error.  A lower alpha level (0.01) means a higher threshold for declaring statistical significance,  which in turn means a lower power.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the given choices in the context of the alpha change.  Choice a) suggests that significant findings can be reported with greater confidence,  but this is not necessarily true,  as the stricter threshold may lead to a higher Type II error rate.  Choice b) states that the study will have more power,  which is incorrect,  as we've established that a lower alpha level decreases power.  Choice c) suggests a decreased likelihood of a Type II error,  which is not the case,  as the stricter threshold increases the likelihood of a Type II error.  Choice d) states that there is an increased likelihood of statistically significant findings,  which is true,  as the stricter threshold makes it harder to declare non-significance.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 25 -year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 6 -day history of fever,  severe muscle pain,  and diffuse,  painful swelling of his neck,  underarms,  and groin area.  The symptoms began after returning from a camping trip in New Mexico.  He appears ill and lethargic and can barely answer questions.  His temperature is 39.2 °C (102.5 °F),  pulse is 120 /min,  respirations are 22 /min,  and blood pressure is 110 /70  mm Hg.  Physical examination shows generalized scattered black maculae.  Examination of the right upper extremity shows an erythematous,  solid,  tender mass on the underside of the upper extremity just above the elbow; the mass is draining blood and necrotic material.  The most effective antibiotic for this patient’s disorder will interfere with which of the following cellular processes or enzymes?  Choices: a) DNA helicase b) Glucuronosyltransferase c) Proteasomal degradation d) Ribosomal assembly 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the patient's condition based on the symptoms and physical examination findings.  The generalized scattered black maculae and the erythematous,  solid,  tender mass on the upper extremity suggest a case of necrotizing fasciitis,  also known as flesh-eating disease.  This is an infection caused by group A streptococcus bacteria.

Next,  I need to determine the most effective antibiotic for treating this condition.  The antibiotic of choice for necrotizing fasciitis is clindamycin,  which belongs to the class of drugs called lincosamides.

Now,  I need to identify which cellular process or enzyme is targeted by clindamycin.  Clindamycin inhibits the ribosomal subunit assembly,  which is essential for the initiation of protein synthesis.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

Vital signs are temperature 38.3 °C (100.9 °F),  pulse 86 /min,  respirations 14 /min,  and blood pressure 138 /70  mm Hg.  There is a 5 ×8 -cm area on the anterior surface of her left lower extremity that is swollen,  erythematous,  and tender.  She previously has developed a rash after taking erythromycin,  and she has had an anaphylactic response to penicillin.  Which of the following antibiotic therapies is most appropriate for this patient?  Choices: a) Amoxicillin b) Ciprofloxacin c) Clarithromycin d) Clindamycin 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history of allergic reactions to erythromycin and penicillin.  This suggests she may have a penicillin allergy,  which would make antibiotic choices a) Amoxicillin and c) Clarithromycin unsuitable.
 Next,  I need to consider the patient's HIV infection.  HIV-infected patients are more susceptible to certain infections,  and antibiotic choices should be made with this in mind.  Among the options,  b) Ciprofloxacin and d) Clindamycin are both appropriate for treating infections in HIV-infected patients.
 Finally,  I need to consider the site of infection.  The patient has a lower extremity infection,  which is more likely to be caused by gram-positive bacteria.  Among the remaining options,  d) Clindamycin is the antibiotic choice for gram-positive bacteria.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate antibiotic therapy for this patient is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 35 -year-old woman comes to the physician because of two 12 -hour episodes of dizziness over the past 3  months.

 First,  I need to consider the symptoms described.  The patient experiences two 12 -hour episodes of dizziness,  with acute onset of rotatory vertigo and imbalance,  decreased hearing,  tinnitus,  a sense of fullness of the right ear,  and vomiting.  These symptoms are consistent with a condition affecting the inner ear or auditory system.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the options given.  a) Acoustic neuroma is a tumor of the vestibulocochlear nerve,  which can cause hearing loss and balance problems.  b) Benign positional vertigo is caused by problems with the inner ear,  but typically does not include hearing loss or tinnitus.  c) Brain stem transient ischemic attacks are caused by a temporary interruption of blood flow to the brain,  and do not typically present with hearing loss or inner ear symptoms.  d) Meniere's disease is an inner ear disorder that can cause hearing loss,  balance problems,  and other symptoms such as tinnitus and vertigo.
 Comparing the symptoms to the options,  Meniere's disease is the most likely diagnosis,  as it matches the patient's symptoms.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 22 -year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 5 -day history of sore throat and fever.  During the past 3  days,  she also has noticed a change in her voice and has had increased pain with swallowing.  She has been taking acetaminophen since her symptoms began.  Medical history is unremarkable and she takes no routine medications.  Vital signs are temperature 40.0 °C (104.0 °F),  pulse 130 /min,  respirations 18 /min,  and blood pressure 102 /66  mm Hg.  Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97 %.  Examination of the oropharynx shows erythema,  edema,  and anterior displacement of the right side of the soft palate.  The uvula is deviated to the left.  There is a white exudate on the right tonsil.  Trismus is noted.  Palpation of the neck discloses enlarged,  tender,  mobile anterior cervical lymph nodes.  In addition to antibiotic therapy,  which of the following is the most appropriate management?  Choices: a) Incision and drainage b) Intravenous methylprednisolone therapy c) Oral nystatin therapy d) Salt water gargle 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination.  The presence of erythema,  edema,  and anterior displacement of the soft palate,  deviation of the uvula,  white exudate on the tonsils,  and trismus are all suggestive of peritonsillar abscess.  The enlarged,  tender,  mobile anterior cervical lymph nodes are consistent with the spread of the infection to the lymph nodes.
 Next,  I need to consider the appropriate management for a peritonsillar abscess.  The most appropriate management is to drain the abscess to relieve the patient's symptoms and prevent complications.  Incision and drainage is the most effective and definitive treatment for a peritonsillar abscess.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 45 -year-old female presents to the office for evaluation of unexplained elevations of her blood pressure.  Paroxysmal episodes of headache,  sweating,  anxiety,  nausea,  and vomiting occur frequently.  A CT scan reveals a left adrenal mass.  Which of the following urinary assays will be most helpful in establishing this patient's diagnosis?  Choices: a) cortisol b) glucose c) sodium d) vanillylmandelic acid 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation and the CT scan findings.  The patient is experiencing paroxysmal episodes of headache,  sweating,  anxiety,  nausea,  and vomiting,  which are suggestive of a neuroendocrine tumor.  The CT scan reveals a left adrenal mass,  which is consistent with an adrenal pheochromocytoma.
 Next,  I need to consider the available urinary assays and their relevance to adrenal pheochromocytoma.  a) cortisol is not specific to pheochromocytoma,  as it is a hormone produced by the cortex of the adrenal gland.  b) glucose is not related to pheochromocytoma.  c) sodium is not specific to pheochromocytoma.  d) vanillylmandelic acid is a metabolite of norepinephrine,  a neurotransmitter that is overproduced in pheochromocytomas.
 Therefore,  the most helpful urinary assay in establishing this patient's diagnosis is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 24 -year-old man is brought to the emergency department 40  minutes after he was involved in a motor vehicle collision.  He was the unrestrained driver.  He is conscious.  Physical examination shows numerous lacerations and ecchymoses over the face.  His vision is normal.  Ocular,  facial,  and lingual movements are intact.  The gag reflex is present.  Sensation to pinprick is absent over the right side of the face anterior to the right ear,  extending down along the full extent of the mandible to the chin.  Sensation also is absent over the right side of the tongue.  X-rays of the skull show fractures of the orbit,  zygomatic arch,  and infratemporal fossa.  The most likely cause of these findings is a fracture affecting which of the following locations?  Choices: a) Foramen lacerum b) Foramen ovale c) Foramen rotundum d) Foramen spinosum 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the location of the sensory deficits and the fractures on the face.  The sensory deficits are absent over the right side of the face anterior to the right ear,  extending down along the full extent of the mandible to the chin.  This corresponds to the distribution of the right maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve.
 Next,  I need to consider the location of the foramina in relation to the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve.  The foramen lacerum is located on the carotid sheath,  which is not related to the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve.
 The foramen ovale is located on the anterior surface of the sphenoid bone,  which is not related to the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve.
 The foramen rotundum is located on the maxillary bone,  which is related to the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve.
 The foramen spinosum is located on the zygomatic arch,  which is related to the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve.
 The fractures shown on the X-rays are of the orbit,  zygomatic arch,  and infratemporal fossa.  These structures are all related to the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve.
 Therefore,  the most likely cause of these findings is a fracture affecting the foramen rotundum ({'sol': 'c'})"

 First,  I need to identify the condition the infant is presenting with.  The white lesions in the mouth are consistent with oral candidiasis,  commonly known as thrush.
 Next,  I need to determine the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for treating thrush.  The most commonly used antifungal agents for treating thrush are nystatin and fluconazole.
 Acyclovir and valacyclovir are antiviral medications used to treat herpes infections,  not fungal infections like thrush.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for the infant's condition is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 45 -year-old man comes to the physician because of right shoulder pain that began after he chopped wood 2  days ago.  Examination of the right upper extremity shows no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness.  The pain is reproduced when the patient is asked to externally rotate the shoulder against resistance; there is no weakness.  In addition to the teres minor,  inflammation of which of the following tendons is most likely in this patient?  Choices: a) Infraspinatus b) Pectoralis c) Subscapularis d) Supraspinatus 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation and the examination findings.  The patient has right shoulder pain that is reproduced when externally rotating the shoulder against resistance,  and there is no bone deformity or point tenderness.
 Next,  I need to consider the tendons that are involved in external rotation of the shoulder.  The infraspinatus tendon is not involved in external rotation,  so it can be ruled out.  The pectoralis tendon is not a rotator cuff tendon,  so it can also be ruled out.  The subscapularis tendon is involved in internal rotation,  not external rotation,  so it can be ruled out as well.
 The supraspinatus tendon is one of the rotator cuff tendons and is involved in external rotation of the shoulder.  Inflammation of the supraspinatus tendon can cause symptoms similar to those described in the patient.
 Therefore,  the most likely tendon involved in this patient's condition is the supraspinatus tendon,  which corresponds to answer choice d) Supraspinatus.

"Input: A 67 -year-old woman comes to the physician because of easy bruising for 4  months.  She has a history of lung cancer treated with radiation therapy 6  months ago.  She has a 2 -year history of hypertension treated with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.  Examination,  including neurologic examination,  shows no abnormalities except for multiple ecchymoses.  Her hemoglobin concentration is 13  g/dL,  leukocyte count is 5000 /mm3  ,  and platelet count is 35,000 /mm3  .  A serum antiplatelet antibody assay is negative.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?  Choices: a) CT scan of the abdomen b) CT scan of the chest c) Bronchoscopy d) Bone marrow aspiration 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and physical examination findings.  The patient has a history of lung cancer treated with radiation therapy and presents with easy bruising,  multiple ecchymoses,  and normal hematologic parameters except for a slightly low platelet count.  The negative serum antiplatelet antibody assay suggests that the thrombocytopenia is not due to a primary immune thrombocytopenia.

Next,  I need to consider the differential diagnosis for easy bruising and ecchymoses in a patient with a history of radiation therapy.  The most likely cause is radiation-induced myelopathy,  which can lead to thrombocytopenia and bleeding.

Given the most likely diagnosis,  the most appropriate next step in diagnosis is to perform a bone marrow aspiration to assess for radiation-induced myelopathy and to evaluate the bone marrow for any changes that could be causing the thrombocytopenia.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 16 -year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because she is concerned that she may have contracted meningitis from her soccer teammate,  who was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis and admitted to the hospital yesterday.  The patient's soccer team traveled to a neighboring state to participate in a tournament 1  week ago and she shared a hotel room with the girl who was hospitalized.  The patient feels well but is concerned she may have ""caught the same bug. "" Medical history is remarkable for asthma.  Medications include inhaled albuterol.  Vital signs are temperature 37.2 °C (98.9 °F),  pulse 64 /min,  respirations 16 /min,  and blood pressure 107 /58  mm Hg.  Physical examination shows no abnormalities.  Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention for this patient at this time?  Choices: a) Administer the meningococcal vaccine b) Prescribe doxycycline c) Prescribe penicillin d) Prescribe rifampin 
 Output:
 First,  I need to assess the risk of the patient contracting meningitis.  The patient shared a hotel room with someone who had meningococcal meningitis and has a history of asthma,  which is a risk factor for severe meningococcal disease.  However,  the patient is currently feeling well and has no abnormalities on physical examination.
 Next,  I need to consider the appropriate intervention based on the risk.  The meningococcal vaccine is recommended for high-risk individuals,  but the patient does not appear to be in a high-risk group.  Doxycycline is an antibiotic that can be used for prophylaxis in high-risk individuals,  but the patient does not have any other underlying conditions that would make this necessary.  Penicillin is an antibiotic used to treat meningococcal disease,  not prophylaxis.  Rifampin is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis,  not meningitis.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate intervention for this patient at this time is to reassure her that she is at low risk for contracting meningitis based on the current information and monitor her for any symptoms.  None of the choices provided is the most appropriate intervention.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'None'}"
"Input: A 19 -year-old woman comes to the emergency department because,  she says,  ""I'm burning up. "" Medical history is significant for intravenous drug use.

Choices: a) Decreased intensity of S1  b) Increased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration c) Increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration d) Positive Kussmaul sign (rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration) 
 Output:
 First,  we need to consider the patient's medical history of intravenous drug use,  which can lead to infectious endocarditis.  The systolic heart murmur over the precordium is suggestive of valvular heart disease,  which can be a complication of endocarditis.
 Next,  we need to evaluate the physical findings related to infectious endocarditis.  One of the expected findings is the Kussmaul sign,  which is characterized by a rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 26 -year-old male police officer comes to the office for an annual health maintenance examination.  He is physically active and feels well,  but he notes that his asthma has been more active during the past month.  He says that he has had to use his albuterol inhaler one to two times daily for wheezing and chest tightness.  He has not had gastroesophageal reflux symptoms,  productive cough,  or fever.  Medical history is remarkable for atopic allergies,  especially to pollen and cats.  He has had coldand exercise-induced asthma for the past 14  years.  He takes no other medications.  He is 188  cm (6  ft 2  in) tall and weighs 90  kg (200  lb); BMI is 25  kg/m2  .  Vital signs are temperature 37.0 °C (98.6 °F),  pulse 70 /min,  respirations 12 /min,  and blood pressure 120 /76  mm Hg.  Physical examination shows no abnormalities except for scattered rhonchi and wheezes with forced expiration.  Peak expiratory flow rate is 240  L/min.  Which of the following is the most appropriate management?  Choices: a) Chest x-ray b) Fexofenadine therapy c) Increased use of the albuterol inhaler d) Initiation of a daily corticosteroid inhaler 
 Output:
 First,  I need to assess the severity of the asthma exacerbation.  The patient is physically active,  feels well,  and has not had gastroesophageal reflux symptoms,  productive cough,  or fever.  His peak expiratory flow rate is 240  L/min,  which is within the normal range.  Based on these findings,  the exacerbation is mild.
 Next,  I need to consider the appropriate management for a mild asthma exacerbation.  The most appropriate management for a mild exacerbation is to continue the patient's current asthma therapy and monitor the response to therapy.  In this case,  the patient is already using albuterol inhaler as needed for wheezing and chest tightness.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate management is to maintain the current use of the albuterol inhaler and monitor the patient's response to therapy.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A previously healthy 15 -year-old boy is brought to the emergency department in August 1  hour after the onset of headache,  dizziness,  nausea,  and one episode of vomiting.  His symptoms began during the first hour of full-contact football practice in full uniform.  He reported feeling weak and faint but did not lose consciousness.  He vomited once after drinking water.  On arrival,  he is diaphoretic.  He is not oriented to person,  place,  or time.  His temperature is 39.5 °C (103.1 °F),  pulse is 120 /min,  respirations are 40 /min,  and blood pressure is 90 /65  mm Hg.

 The most appropriate next step in management is to address the patient's dehydration and hypotension.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A new severe respiratory illness caused by a newly identified virus is discovered.  Which of the following properties of a killed vaccine relative to a live vaccine is the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine for this illness?  Choices: a) Avoids the concern for reversion to virulence b) Develops more rapid protective immunity c) Is less likely to require subsequent boosters for lifelong immunity d) Is most likely to generate mucosal immunity 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the properties of killed and live vaccines.  A killed vaccine contains inactivated or killed pathogens,  while a live vaccine contains live,  attenuated pathogens.
 Next,  I need to consider the context of a severe respiratory illness caused by a newly identified virus.  In this case,  the concern is for developing a vaccine that minimizes the risk of adverse effects and maximizes protective immunity.
 Now,  I can evaluate the choices.  Avoiding reversion to virulence (a) is a concern with live vaccines,  as the attenuated pathogens could potentially regain virulence.  However,  this is not the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine in this context.
 Developing more rapid protective immunity (b) is not necessarily an advantage of a killed vaccine over a live vaccine,  as live vaccines can also provide rapid immunity.
 Being less likely to require subsequent boosters for lifelong immunity (c) is not necessarily an advantage of a killed vaccine over a live vaccine,  as live vaccines can also provide long-lasting immunity.
 Generating mucosal immunity (d) is not a unique advantage of a killed vaccine over a live vaccine,  as live vaccines can also generate mucosal immunity.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine for this illness is to avoid the concern for reversion to virulence (a).  The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

 First,  I need to assess the severity of the burn and the presence of infection.  The patient has multiple burn sites with a white exudative appearance,  erythema surrounding the burn areas,  and red streaks extending up the thigh,  which are signs of infection.  There is also fluctuance at the burn sites.
 The patient is also experiencing shaking chills,  a fever of 39.2 °C,  and elevated white blood cell count,  which are also signs of infection.
 Given the presence of infection,  the most appropriate next step is to perform incision and drainage to remove the pus and reduce the risk of further complications.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 32 -year-old man comes to the physician because he has had difficulty focusing on tasks at work and at home during the past 2  months.  He works as an automobile mechanic.  He has had a lot of energy for work but often is distracted to the point that he does not complete assigned tasks.  He frequently stops working on his own tasks to attempt to develop greater efficiency in his shop.  He states that he is delighted with his newfound energy and reports that he now needs only 4  hours of sleep nightly.  He has no history of psychiatric illness.  He always performed well in school.  He has a history of drinking alcohol excessively and using methamphetamines and cocaine during his 20 s,  but he has not consumed alcohol or used illicit drugs for the past 3  years.

Short- and long-term memory are intact.  Attention and concentration are fair; he makes no errors when performing serial sevens,  and he can repeat seven digits forward and five in reverse sequence.  He has had no delusions or hallucinations.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  Choices: a) Antisocial personality disorder b) Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder c) Bipolar disorder d) Borderline personality disorder 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's age and the symptoms presented.  The patient is 32  years old and has difficulty focusing,  high energy levels,  and distractibility.  This is not consistent with a personality disorder,  so I can rule out options a) Antisocial personality disorder and d) Borderline personality disorder.
 Next,  I need to consider the patient's history of methamphetamines and cocaine use in his 20 s.  This history is suggestive of a current or past substance use disorder,  but the patient has not used these substances for the past 3  years.  Therefore,  I can rule out a diagnosis of substance-induced disorder.
 This leaves me with option b) Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder as the most likely diagnosis.  The patient's difficulty focusing,  high energy levels,  and distractibility are consistent with the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
 Therefore,  the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 72 -year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2 -month history of painless swelling of both ankles.  She also reports shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down.

Jugular venous pressure is 15  cm H2 O.  Pulmonary examination shows crackles at both lung bases.  Cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm and a soft S3.  A grade 3 /6  holosystolic murmur is heard best at the apex,  radiating to the axilla.  There is 2 + pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles.  Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?  Choices: a) Measurement of serum troponin I concentration b) ECG c) Exercise stress test d) Echocardiography 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the possible diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination.  The patient has swelling of both ankles,  shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down,  crackles at both lung bases,  a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex,  and 2 + pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles.  These findings are suggestive of heart failure.
 Next,  I need to determine which test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis of heart failure.  Among the choices,  a) Measurement of serum troponin I concentration is used to detect myocardial injury or infarction,  not heart failure.  b) ECG can detect arrhythmias or ischemic changes,  but it is not specific for heart failure.  c) Exercise stress test can help differentiate between coronary artery disease and heart failure,  but it is not definitive for the diagnosis of heart failure.  d) Echocardiography is a non-invasive imaging technique that can assess cardiac structure and function,  and it is highly specific for the diagnosis of heart failure.
 Therefore,  the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 32 -year-old man who is a jackhammer operator comes to the physician because of pain and swelling of his right arm for 3  days.  The symptoms are moderately exacerbated by exertion.  Examination of the right upper extremity shows erythema and moderate edema.  Capillary refill time is less than 3  seconds.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  Choices: a) Axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis b) Deep venous valvular insufficiency c) Superficial thrombophlebitis of the basilic vein d) Superior vena cava syndrome 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.  The patient is a 32 -year-old man who is a jackhammer operator,  which increases the risk of developing venous thromboembolism due to prolonged standing and intense physical activity.  The symptoms include pain,  swelling,  and erythema of the right arm,  which are consistent with venous thrombosis or thrombophlebitis.  The symptoms are moderately exacerbated by exertion,  which suggests that the condition is related to the venous system rather than the arterial system.  The capillary refill time is less than 3  seconds,  which indicates adequate blood flow to the skin.

Next,  I need to evaluate the diagnostic options.  a) Axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis is a less likely diagnosis because it usually presents with more severe symptoms and signs, such as paresis of the deltoid muscle,  pulmonary embolism,  and lower extremity swelling.  b) Deep venous valvular insufficiency is also less likely because it typically presents with chronic symptoms of venous insufficiency,  such as varicose veins,  ulcers,  and chronic swelling.  c) Superficial thrombophlebitis of the basilic vein is a possible diagnosis,  but it usually presents with more localized symptoms and signs,  such as erythema,  swelling,  and tenderness along the vein,  without significant exacerbation by exertion.  d) Superior vena cava syndrome is the most likely diagnosis because it is caused by compression of the superior vena cava by the enlarged lymph nodes or tumors in the chest wall,  leading to symptoms such as pain,  swelling,  and erythema of the upper extremity,  which are exacerbated by exertion.

Therefore,  the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 63 -year-old woman is in the hospital recovery room 4  hours after elective left hemicolectomy for colon carcinoma at the splenic flexure.  She has a preoperative written directive for no blood products through transfusion for religious reasons.  Medical history is significant for hypertension and coronary artery disease.  The nurse tells you the patient's blood pressure has progressively declined since the operation.  Vital signs now are temperature 35.8 °C (96.4 °F),  pulse 130 /min,  respirations 20 /min,  and blood pressure 80 /50  mm Hg.  Physical examination discloses a slightly distended abdomen with an intact incision.  ECG shows sinus tachycardia.  Urine output has been 10  mL during the past 2  hours.  Hematocrit is 30 %; preoperative hematocrit was 41 %.  The patient has received 4  L of intravenous crystalloid in the recovery room.  Reported operative blood loss was 200  mL.  Drainage from the nasogastric tube is clear.  Damage to which of the following structures is most likely responsible for these findings?  Choices: a) Epigastric artery b) Liver c) Middle colic artery d) Spleen 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the most likely cause of the patient's progressive blood pressure decline.  The patient has received 4  L of intravenous crystalloid in the recovery room,  and her hematocrit has decreased from 41 % to 30 %,  indicating significant blood loss.  The reported operative blood loss was 200  mL,  which is not enough to cause such a significant decrease in hematocrit.
 Next,  I need to consider the location of the blood vessels that could be damaged during the surgery.  The options are the epigastric artery,  liver,  middle colic artery,  and spleen.  The epigastric artery is located in the upper abdomen,  the liver is located under the diaphragm,  the middle colic artery is located in the transverse colon,  and the spleen is located in the left upper quadrant.
 The patient's symptoms,  such as a slightly distended abdomen with an intact incision,  sinus tachycardia,  and clear drainage from the nasogastric tube,  suggest that the blood loss is related to a structure in the lower abdomen or the colon.  The middle colic artery is the most likely cause of the patient's blood pressure decline,  as it is located in the transverse colon and is close to the splenic flexure,  where the surgery was performed.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 30 -year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2 -day history of abdominal pain.  She has a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections,  sinusitis,  and pancreatitis.  She has thick nasal secretions.  She says that her sweat is salty and crystallizes on her skin.  Her vital signs are within normal limits.  Physical examination shows epigastric tenderness.  Genetic testing for the 36  most common mutations shows a detectable mutation (G551 D) in one allele of the CFTR gene.  Which of the following best explains this patient's clinical phenotype?  Choices: a) Only one G551 D allele is needed in CFTR b) The patient is a CFTR obligate carrier c) The patient's CFTR mutation is unrelated to her clinical phenotype d) The second CFTR mutation was not detected by the testing obtained 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the clinical phenotype of the patient.  She has recurrent upper respiratory tract infections,  sinusitis,  and pancreatitis,  as well as thick nasal secretions and salty sweat that crystallizes on her skin.  These symptoms are consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF),  a genetic disorder that affects the lungs,  pancreas,  and other organs.
 Next,  I need to consider the genetic testing results.  The patient has a detectable mutation (G551 D) in one allele of the CFTR gene.  The CFTR gene is responsible for producing a protein that regulates the movement of salt ions across cell membranes.  Mutations in this gene can lead to the buildup of thick mucus in the lungs and digestive system,  causing the symptoms of CF.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  Choice a) suggests that only one G551 D allele is needed in CFTR,  which is incorrect because CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene,  not just one allele.  Choice b) suggests that the patient is a CFTR obligate carrier,  which is also incorrect because the patient has symptoms,  not just the genetic mutation.  Choice c) suggests that the patient's CFTR mutation is unrelated to her clinical phenotype,  which is incorrect because the mutation is known to cause CF.  Choice d) suggests that the second CFTR mutation was not detected by the testing obtained,  which is the most plausible explanation for the patient's clinical phenotype.  If the patient has only one mutated allele,  she may not have full-blown CF,  but still have symptoms due to the presence of the mutated allele.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

His sister states that he recently saw a psychiatrist for the first time because of hearing voices; he was prescribed a medication,  but she is not sure what it is.  She says that he has a history of excessive drinking,  and she thinks that he has also experimented with illicit drugs.  He appears acutely ill.  His temperature is 39.1 °C (102.3 °F),  pulse is 124 /min,  and blood pressure is 160 /102  mm Hg.  Examination shows profuse diaphoresis and muscle rigidity.  His neck is supple.  The abdomen is soft and nontender.  Mental status examination shows psychomotor agitation alternating with lethargy.  His leukocyte count is 15,600 /mm3  ,  and serum creatine kinase activity is 943  U/L.  Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?  Choices: a) Amphetamine intoxication b) Bacterial meningitis c) Delirium tremens d) Neuroleptic malignant syndrome 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and symptoms.  He has a history of excessive drinking and has recently started taking medication for hearing voices,  which may indicate a psychiatric condition.  His symptoms include confusion,  inability to answer questions,  increased temperature,  rapid pulse,  high blood pressure,  profuse diaphoresis,  muscle rigidity,  psychomotor agitation alternating with lethargy,  and elevated leukocyte count and serum creatine kinase activity.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the possible explanations for his symptoms.  Amphetamine intoxication would not explain the psychiatric history and the specific symptoms he is presenting.  Bacterial meningitis would not fit the symptoms well,  as the patient's neck is supple and the abdomen is normal.  Delirium tremens could be a possibility,  but the patient's psychiatric history and specific symptoms suggest a more severe reaction to the medication he was prescribed.
 Finally,  I need to consider Neuroleptic malignant syndrome,  which is a rare but severe reaction to certain psychiatric medications,  characterized by fever,  muscle rigidity,  psychomotor agitation alternating with lethargy,  and elevated leukocyte count and serum creatine kinase activity.  This fits the patient's symptoms and history well.
 Therefore,  the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 16 -year-old boy is admitted to the emergency department because of a knife wound to the left side of his chest.  An x-ray of the chest shows an air-fluid level in the left side of the chest,  partial collapse of the left lung,  and elevation of the stomach bubble.  The mediastinum is in the midline.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  Choices: a) Hemopneumothorax,  not under tension b) Hemothorax,  not under tension c) Pneumothorax,  not under tension d) Tension hemopneumothorax 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the presence of an air-fluid level,  which indicates the presence of air in the pleural cavity.  This rules out options b) Hemothorax,  not under tension and d) Tension hemopneumothorax,  as these conditions would not show an air-fluid level.
 Next,  the partial collapse of the left lung and elevation of the stomach bubble suggest that the air is not compressing the lung completely,  which is consistent with a pneumothorax.  This rules out option a) Hemopneumothorax,  not under tension,  as this would likely show more complete lung collapse.
 Therefore,  the most likely diagnosis is c) Pneumothorax,  not under tension.
 The output is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 72 -year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit for pain management and observation of ventricular ectopy 4  hours after undergoing uncomplicated left total knee replacement.  He is receiving fentanyl via systemic patient-controlled analgesic pump for pain management.  Medical history is remarkable for coronary artery disease,  for which he takes atorvastatin,  furosemide,  carvedilol,  lisinopril,  and 81 -mg aspirin.  Baseline echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 0.20.  Vital signs now are temperature 38.0 °C (100.4 °F),  pulse 90 /min,  respirations 16 /min,  and blood pressure 130 /90  mm Hg.  Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96 %.  Physical examination discloses no unexpected abnormalities.  Which of the following regimens for prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis will likely be most beneficial in this patient?  Choices: a) Continuous application of bilateral lower extremity pneumatic compression devices b) Continuous intravenous infusion of heparin titrated to a PTT of 1.5  to 2.0  times the control value c) Oral warfarin d) Subcutaneous enoxaparin 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (DVT).  The patient is 72  years old,  which is an increased risk factor for DVT.  He has undergone a surgical procedure,  which is another risk factor.  His baseline echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 0.20,  indicating heart failure,  which is also a risk factor for DVT.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the available options for DVT prophylaxis.  Option a) bilateral lower extremity pneumatic compression devices is an effective method for preventing DVT in patients who are able to wear them and are mobilizing.  Option b) continuous intravenous infusion of heparin titrated to a PTT of 1.5  to 2.0  times the control value is an option for patients who cannot wear compression devices or are not mobilizing.  Option c) oral warfarin is an anticoagulant that can be used for DVT prophylaxis,  but it requires regular monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR) and carries the risk of bleeding.  Option d) subcutaneous enoxaparin is an alternative anticoagulant that can be used for DVT prophylaxis,  but it also requires regular monitoring of INR and carries the risk of bleeding.
 Given the patient's risk factors and the options available,  the most beneficial regimen for DVT prophylaxis would likely be option a) continuous application of bilateral lower extremity pneumatic compression devices,  as the patient is in the intensive care unit and may be mobilizing soon after surgery.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 67 -year-old woman has had fatigue,  dry skin,  brittle hair,  swelling of the ankles,  and cold intolerance for 1  year; she has gained 9  kg (20  lb) during this period.  Her pulse is 55 /min,  and blood pressure is 150 /90  mm Hg.  She appears lethargic.  Examination shows dry skin and a nontender thyroid gland that is enlarged to two times its normal size.  There is mild edema of the ankles bilaterally.  The relaxation phase of the Achilles reflex is greatly prolonged.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  Choices: a) Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto disease) b) Defect in thyroxine (T4 ) biosynthesis c) Graves disease d) Multinodular goiter 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and physical examination findings.  The patient has fatigue,  dry skin,  brittle hair,  swelling of the ankles,  and cold intolerance for 1  year,  which are classic symptoms of hypothyroidism.  Additionally,  she has gained weight and her pulse is slow,  and her blood pressure is elevated.  The physical examination shows dry skin,  a nontender enlarged thyroid gland,  and mild edema of the ankles.  The prolonged relaxation phase of the Achilles reflex is also suggestive of hypothyroidism.
 Next,  I need to consider the diagnostic options.  Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto disease) is an autoimmune disorder that can cause hypothyroidism,  but it typically presents with a goiter rather than an enlarged thyroid gland.  Defect in thyroxine (T4 ) biosynthesis can cause hypothyroidism,  but it is less common and would not typically present with the specific symptoms and physical findings in this case.  Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism,  not hypothyroidism,  so it is not the most likely diagnosis.  Multinodular goiter is a benign enlargement of the thyroid gland,  which can cause hypothyroidism,  but it is less likely to present with the specific symptoms and physical findings in this case.
 Therefore,  the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 2 -year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother for follow-up of a chromosome analysis done 1  month ago.  The child has minor dysmorphic features,  and growth and developmental delay.  Chromosome analysis showed a small unbalanced chromosome translocation,  with extra chromosomal material at the tip of chromosome 3.  The cytogenetics laboratory requested blood samples from both parents for follow-up studies.  The parents are divorced,  and the mother has custody of the child.  The relationship between the parents is hostile.  The mother has been tested and has normal chromosomes without evidence of translocation.  At today's visit,  she reacts angrily when the issue of contacting the child's father for testing is raised.  She states that he abandoned them and that he has no interest in his child.  She refuses to cooperate in contacting the father,  who could be a translocation carrier.  You do not know the father,  but an office worker told you that he lives in a nearby town.  The mother says that he is living with a new girlfriend.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?  Choices: a) Attempt to identify the father's physician and work with that physician to obtain chromosome studies on the father b) Contact the father by telephone and arrange for him to give a blood sample at a local hospital c) Document your attempts to work with the mother but proceed no further,  since you have no physician-patient relationship with the father d) Help the mother deal with her anger and educate her regarding the potential benefit to her son and others if the father's chromosome studies are done 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the ethical and legal implications of the situation.  The child's best interest should be the priority,  and obtaining the father's chromosome analysis is crucial for determining the carrier status and potential risk to future offspring.
 Next,  I need to consider the practical steps I can take to achieve this.  Option a) involves working with the father's physician,  which may be difficult due to the hostile relationship between the mother and father.  Option b) involves contacting the father directly,  which may not be effective if he is uninterested or unavailable.
 Option c) is a valid option,  but it does not address the child's best interest.  Option d) focuses on the mother's emotional state and education,  which may help in the long run but may not immediately lead to the father's testing.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate next step is to attempt to identify the father's physician and work with that physician to obtain chromosome studies on the father.  This option takes into account the ethical and legal implications while also being practical.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 3 -year-old girl is brought to the physician because of fever and left ear pain for 3  days.  She has been treated with amoxicillin for the past 5  days for left otitis media.  Her temperature is 38.5 °C (101.3 °F),  pulse is 100 /min,  respirations are 20 /min,  and blood pressure is 80 /60  mm Hg.  Examination shows the left ear displaced forward and laterally from the head.  There is edema and tenderness behind the left ear.  Otoscopic examination shows a red,  dull,  left tympanic membrane that does not move.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  Choices: a) Acoustic neuroma b) Labyrinthitis c) Lateral sinus thrombosis d) Mastoiditis 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and signs presented.  The patient is a 3-year-old girl with fever,  left ear pain,  and left otitis media that has not responded to amoxicillin.  There is a significant amount of edema and tenderness behind the left ear,  and the tympanic membrane is red,  dull,  and immobile.

Next,  I need to evaluate the diagnostic options.  Acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor of the vestibulocochlear nerve,  which is not typically associated with fever,  left ear pain,  or the clinical findings described.  Labyrinthitis is an inflammation of the inner ear,  which can cause hearing loss and balance disturbances,  but it is not usually associated with the described physical findings.  Lateral sinus thrombosis is a rare condition that can cause fever,  headache,  and altered mental status,  but it is not typically associated with left ear pain or the physical findings described.  Mastoiditis is an inflammation of the mastoid bone,  which can cause fever,  left ear pain,  and the described physical findings,  such as edema and tenderness behind the left ear and a non-moving tympanic membrane.

Therefore,  the most likely diagnosis is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 62 -year-old woman comes to the physician because of low back pain for 1  week.  Menopause occurred 10  years ago.  Physical examination shows localized tenderness over the lumbar spine after movement.  X-rays of the spine show a compression fracture of L1 -2.  A DEXA scan shows decreased bone mineral density.  Serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations and serum alkaline phosphatase activity are within the reference ranges.  A bisphosphonate drug is prescribed.  The expected beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to which of the following actions?  Choices: a) Decreased insulin-like growth factor-1  concentration b) Decreased osteoclast activity c) Decreased osteoprotegerin production d) Increased 1,25 -dihydroxycholecalciferol concentration 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the pathophysiology of the compression fracture.  The compression fracture is likely due to osteoporosis,  a condition characterized by decreased bone mineral density.  Osteoporosis is caused by an imbalance between bone resorption (breakdown) and bone formation.
 Next,  I need to consider the mechanism of action of bisphosphonate drugs.  Bisphosphonates are medications that inhibit the activity of osteoclasts,  which are cells responsible for bone resorption.
 Now,  I can evaluate the choices.  a) Decreased insulin-like growth factor-1  concentration is not related to the action of bisphosphonates.  b) Decreased osteoclast activity is the direct effect of bisphosphonates.  c) Decreased osteoprotegerin production is not the primary action of bisphosphonates.  d) Increased 1,25 -dihydroxycholecalciferol concentration is not the direct effect of bisphosphonates.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 72 -year-old woman who has smoked 20  cigarettes daily for the past 38  years begins using eyedrops for glaucoma.  Three days later,  she has a marked increase in shortness of breath while walking up a flight of stairs.  Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of the development of shortness of breath in this patient?  Choices: a) Apraclonidine b) Epinephrine c) Latanoprost d) Timolol 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the medication that the patient is taking for glaucoma.  The patient is using eyedrops,  and the choice given is Latanoprost.
 Next,  I need to consider the side effects of Latanoprost.  Latanoprost is a prostaglandin analogue that is used to lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma.  Its side effects include increased light sensitivity, blurred vision, and, in some cases, shortness of breath.
 The other choices are not related to glaucoma treatment: Apraclonidine is an alpha-adrenergic agonist used for glaucoma, but it does not cause shortness of breath; Epinephrine is a bronchodilator used for asthma and other respiratory conditions; Timolol is a beta-blocker used for hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions.
 Therefore,  the most likely cause of the development of shortness of breath in this patient is the Latanoprost eyedrop.

"Input: A 38 -year-old man with Down syndrome and severe mental retardation is brought to the emergency department by ambulance because of increasing lethargy for the past several hours.  The patient is noncommunicative and you are unable to obtain an initial history of his present illness or a past medical history.  You do not know if he takes any medications.  Vital signs are temperature 38.3 °C (100.9 °F),  pulse 90 /min,  respirations 19 /min,  and blood pressure 120 /60  mm Hg.  On physical examination the patient is awake but lethargic.  Auscultation of the chest discloses clear lungs; cardiac examination discloses a systolic click.  Neurologic examination shows decreased muscle tone.  Serum electrolyte concentrations are normal.  Complete blood count shows a leukocyte count of 18,000 /mm3  with 23 % band neutrophils.  The patient's caregiver,  who is also the patient's guardian,  cannot be located and staff at the group home where the patient resides cannot be reached by telephone.  The patient refuses lumbar puncture for examination of cerebrospinal fluid.  Toxicologic screening of the urine is negative.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?  Choices: a) Administer intravenous antibiotics b) Await contact with the caregiver before proceeding with management c) Obtain CT scan of the head d) Obtain echocardiography 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's presentation.  The patient is a 38 -year-old man with Down syndrome and severe mental retardation who is lethargic and has a fever.  The physical examination findings include a systolic click and decreased muscle tone.  These findings suggest a possible cardiac issue,  such as aortic stenosis.
 Next,  I need to consider the most appropriate next step in management.  Since the patient is unable to communicate and his caregiver cannot be located,  it is not possible to await contact with the caregiver before proceeding with management.  Therefore,  option b) is not the most appropriate next step.
 Option a) administering intravenous antibiotics is not the most appropriate next step without a confirmed diagnosis.  The patient's presentation does not suggest an infection that requires antibiotics.
 Option c) obtaining a CT scan of the head is not the most appropriate next step for this patient,  as there is no evidence of a neurological issue.
 Option d) obtaining an echocardiography is the most appropriate next step,  as it can help evaluate the systolic click and determine if there is aortic stenosis or another cardiac issue.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: After being severely beaten and sustaining a gunshot wound to the abdomen,  a 42 -year-old woman undergoes resection of a perforated small bowel.  During the operation,  plastic reconstruction of facial fractures,  and open reduction and internal fixation of the left femur are also done.  Thirty-six hours postoperatively,  she is awake but not completely alert.  She is receiving intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled pump.  She says that she needs the morphine to treat her pain,  but she is worried that she is becoming addicted.  She has no history of substance use disorder.  She drinks one to two glasses of wine weekly.  Which of the following initial actions by the physician is most appropriate?  Choices: a) Reassure the patient that her chance of becoming addicted to narcotics is minuscule b) Maintain the morphine,  but periodically administer intravenous naloxone c) Switch the patient to oral acetaminophen as soon as she can take medication orally d) Switch the patient to intramuscular lorazepam 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and current condition.  The patient has undergone major surgery and is experiencing significant pain.  She is currently receiving intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled pump to manage her pain.  She is concerned about becoming addicted to the medication,  but she has no history of substance use disorder and only drinks one to two glasses of wine weekly.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the available options.  Option a) reassures the patient that her chance of becoming addicted is minuscule,  but this does not address her concerns or the potential risks of the medication.  Option b) maintains the morphine and periodically administers intravenous naloxone,  which could reduce the risk of respiratory depression but does not address the concern of addiction.  Option c) switches the patient to oral acetaminophen,  but this may not be an appropriate pain management option for a patient with significant pain post-surgery.  Option d) switches the patient to intramuscular lorazepam,  which is a sedative and may not be an appropriate pain management option.
 The most appropriate initial action by the physician is to address the patient's concerns and provide reassurance while also ensuring that the medication is used appropriately and in the appropriate dose.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 57 -year-old man comes to the emergency department because of cramping in his hands and feet and numbness and tingling around his lips and in his fingers; these symptoms occurred intermittently for 6  months but have been progressively severe during the past 2  weeks.  He also has had a 13 -kg (30 -lb) weight loss and bulky,  foul-smelling stools that do not flush easily.  He has a 10 -year history of drinking 8  to 10  beers daily.  He has been hospitalized twice for severe abdominal pain 4  and 6  years ago.  His pulse is 80 /min,  and blood pressure is 105 /65  mm Hg.  He appears cachectic and chronically ill.  The abdomen is nontender.  Deep tendon reflexes are 4 + bilaterally.  Chvostek and Trousseau signs are present.  His serum calcium concentration is 6.5  mg/dL.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  Choices: a) Hypomagnesemia b) Hypoparathyroidism c) Osteomalacia d) Vitamin D deficiency 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and signs presented.  The patient has cramping in his hands and feet,  numbness and tingling around his lips and in his fingers,  intermittent but progressively severe symptoms over 6  months,  a 13 -kg weight loss,  bulky,  foul-smelling stools that do not flush easily,  and a history of drinking 8  to 10  beers daily.  The deep tendon reflexes are 4 + bilaterally,  and Chvostek and Trousseau signs are present.  His serum calcium concentration is 6.5  mg/dL.

Second,  I need to consider the laboratory findings.  The serum calcium concentration is 6.5  mg/dL,  which is lower than the normal range of 8.5 -10.2  mg/dL.  This suggests that the patient has hypocalcemia.

Third,  I need to consider the most likely cause of hypocalcemia.  The patient's history of alcohol consumption is significant,  as chronic alcohol abuse can lead to hypocalcemia due to malabsorption of calcium and decreased parathyroid function.  The presence of Chvostek and Trousseau signs,  as well as the deep tendon reflexes being 4 + bilaterally,  are also suggestive of hypoparathyroidism.

Based on the symptoms,  signs,  and laboratory findings,  the most likely diagnosis is hypoparathyroidism.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 78 -year-old woman is admitted to the hospital for replacement of her left knee joint due to degenerative joint disease.  She has type 2  diabetes mellitus,  a long history of hypertension,  and chronic renal failure presumed secondary to diabetes mellitus and hypertension.  Reversible causes of renal failure have been excluded.  She underwent a tonsillectomy at age 9  years and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy at age 68  years.  Serum creatinine concentration on admission was 6.0  mg/dL.  Her current therapy includes a low-sodium,  low-protein American Diabetes Association (ADA) diet,  enalapril,  and acetaminophen.  She is a retired seamstress.  She and her husband live on a farm 90  miles from the nearest dialysis facility.  In considering longterm treatment options for this patient,  which of the following is the most appropriate factor to consider?  Choices: a) Her eligibility to receive Medicare b) Her history of an abdominal operation c) Her history of arthritis d) Her suitability for home dialysis 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the long-term treatment options for this patient.  The options include dialysis,  transplantation,  and home dialysis.  However,  home dialysis is not an option for this patient due to the distance from the nearest dialysis facility.  So,  the options are dialysis or transplantation.
 Next,  I need to consider the factors that are relevant to the decision-making process.  The choices given are her eligibility to receive Medicare,  her history of an abdominal operation,  her history of arthritis,  and her suitability for home dialysis.
 Since home dialysis is not an option,  eligibility to receive Medicare is not a relevant factor.  Her history of an abdominal operation is also not directly related to the treatment options.  Her history of arthritis is not mentioned as a factor affecting her treatment options.
 The most appropriate factor to consider is her suitability for home dialysis,  as it is the only option eliminated by the distance from the nearest dialysis facility.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 75 -year-old female presents to the office for a health maintenance examination.  She says that she is more fatigued than she was at 65,  but she still gardens and drives to the grocery store.  Routine laboratory studies reveal a leukocyte count of 25.0  × 103 /mcL (reference range 4.5 -11.0  × 103 /mcL) and 97 % mature-appearing lymphocytes on a peripheral blood smear.  Immunohistochemical stains demonstrate the lymphocytes to be of B-cell origin.  The most likely diagnosis is Choices: a) acute lymphocytic leukemia b) acute myelogenous leukemia c) chronic lymphocytic leukemia d) chronic myelogenous leukemia 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's age and the clinical presentation.  The patient is 75 years old and presents with fatigue but remains active.
 Next,  I need to analyze the laboratory findings.  The leukocyte count is elevated at 25.0 × 103 /mcL,  which is outside the normal reference range of 4.5 -11.0 × 103 /mcL.  Additionally,  the peripheral blood smear shows 97% mature-appearing lymphocytes,  and immunohistochemical stains confirm the lymphocytes to be of B-cell origin.
 Based on these findings,  the most likely diagnosis is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL),  as it is characterized by the infiltration of mature B-lymphocytes in the blood and bone marrow,  resulting in an elevated leukocyte count and lymphocytosis.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A previously healthy 27 -year-old nulligravid woman comes to the emergency department because of a 2 -day history of moderate-to-severe pain and swelling of the left labia.  She is sexually active and uses condoms inconsistently.  Her temperature is 37.2 °C (99 °F),  pulse is 92 /min,  respirations are 18 /min,  and blood pressure is 115 /75  mm Hg.  Pelvic examination shows a 4  x 3 -cm,  tender,  fluctuant mass medial to the left labium majus compromising the introital opening.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?  Choices: a) Administration of intravenous metronidazole b) Administration of intravenous penicillin G c) Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration of the mass d) Incision and drainage 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's presentation.  The patient has moderate-to-severe pain and swelling of the left labia,  is sexually active,  and uses condoms inconsistently.  These factors suggest a possible sexually transmitted infection (STI),  such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or an abscess.
 Next,  I need to determine the most appropriate next step in management.  Since the patient has a tender,  fluctuant mass,  it is likely an abscess rather than PID.  The most appropriate next step in management for an abscess is to perform needle aspiration to drain the abscess and obtain a sample for culture.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A previously healthy 24 -year-old woman who is a college student comes to the office because of a 6 -month history of abdominal bloating,  upper abdominal discomfort,  and constipation.  The symptoms are more severe when she is preparing for examinations but improve after bowel movements.  She takes no medications.  She does not smoke or use illicit drugs.  She drinks alcoholic beverages occasionally.  She is 160  cm (5  ft 3  in) tall and weighs 57  kg (125  lb); BMI is 22  kg/m2  .  Her pulse is 72 /min,  and blood pressure is 100 /72  mm Hg.  Physical examination,  including digital rectal examination,  shows no other abnormalities.  A complete blood count and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges.  A urease breath test result is negative.  Upper and lower endoscopies show no abnormalities.  Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?  Choices: a) Azathioprine b) Infliximab c) Lubiprostone d) Mesalamine 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms and the diagnostic tests.  The patient has a 6 -month history of abdominal bloating,  upper abdominal discomfort,  and constipation,  which are suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  The urease breath test result is negative,  which rules out Helicobacter pylori infection.  Upper and lower endoscopies show no abnormalities,  which also suggests IBS.  The patient is a young,  otherwise healthy woman,  and the symptoms are more severe during periods of increased stress,  such as exam time.

Next,  I need to consider the pharmacotherapy options.  Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive drug used for autoimmune diseases,  not IBS.  Infliximab is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor used for inflammatory bowel diseases,  not IBS.  Lubiprostone is a gastrointestinal motility drug used for constipation,  but it is not typically used as the first-line treatment for IBS.  Mesalamine is an anti-inflammatory drug used for inflammatory bowel diseases,  but it can also be used for IBS, especially for patients with IBS-related diarrhea.

Therefore,  the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is d) Mesalamine.

"Input: A 22 -year-old woman comes to the office because of urticaria.  This is her first episode of urticaria and it has occurred and then resolved several times in the past week.  The history and physical examination disclose no abnormalities.  Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?  Choices: a) Determine the serum IgE concentration b) Determine the total eosinophil count c) Refer her to an allergist d) Treat the symptoms 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's age and the nature of her symptoms.  She is a 22 -year-old woman with recurrent urticaria,  which is a common condition.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the history and physical examination findings.  There are no abnormalities,  suggesting that the urticaria is not due to an underlying medical condition.
 Finally,  I need to consider the available options.  Determining the serum IgE concentration and the total eosinophil count are both laboratory tests that may be helpful in certain cases of urticaria,  but they are not the most appropriate initial action for a patient with recurrent urticaria without any underlying causes.  Referring her to an allergist is a reasonable option,  as they may be able to identify any potential allergens or provide additional treatment options.  Treating the symptoms is also an option,  but it does not address the underlying cause of the urticaria.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate course of action is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 72 -year-old man comes to the physician because of a 7 -month history of leg weakness and dry eyes and mouth.  He also has had a 10.4 -kg (23 -lb) weight loss over the past 4  months despite no change in appetite.  He has smoked one and a half packs of cigarettes daily for 50  years.  He drinks 4  oz of alcohol daily.  He has peptic ulcer disease and emphysema.  Medications include cimetidine,  theophylline,  and low-dose prednisone.  Examination shows mild ptosis.  He has a barrelshaped chest.  Breath sounds are distant.  There is moderate weakness of proximal muscles of the lower extremities.  Reflexes are absent.  He has difficulty rising from a chair.  Sensory examination shows no abnormalities.  An x-ray shows a hyperinflated chest and a 3  x 4 -cm mass in the right hilum.  His neurologic findings are most likely due to a lesion involving which of the following?  Choices: a) Muscle membrane b) Parasympathetic nervous system c) Peripheral nerve d) Presynaptic neuromuscular junction 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the cause of the patient's symptoms.  The leg weakness,  dry eyes and mouth,  and weight loss are suggestive of a neurologic lesion.  The smoking history and barrel-shaped chest suggest a history of emphysema.  The x-ray shows a hyperinflated chest and a mass in the right hilum,  which is suggestive of lung cancer.
 Next,  I need to determine which part of the neuromuscular system is affected.  The proximal muscle weakness and absent reflexes are suggestive of a lesion at the neuromuscular junction.  The sensory examination is normal,  so the lesion is not due to a peripheral nerve issue.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 4 -year-old boy is brought for a follow-up examination.  He has a history of chronic recurrent otitis media and recently completed a 10 -day course of antibiotics.  His vital signs are within normal limits.  Examination shows clear ear canals and intact tympanic membranes; a brown,  irregular mass is visualized behind the tympanic membrane.  Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?  Choices: a) Epithelial tissue proliferation b) Lingual papillae loss c) Middle ear effusion d) Midface hypoplasia 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the history and physical findings.  The patient has a history of chronic recurrent otitis media and a brown,  irregular mass is visualized behind the tympanic membrane.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the choices based on the clinical information.  a) Epithelial tissue proliferation is a possible explanation,  but it is not specific to otitis media.  b) Lingual papillae loss is not related to otitis media or the findings described.  c) Middle ear effusion is a common cause of chronic otitis media and can lead to brown,  irregular masses behind the tympanic membrane.  d) Midface hypoplasia is not typically associated with chronic otitis media or the described findings.
 Therefore,  the most likely explanation for these findings is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 35 -year-old male presents to the office for the result of an HIV test,  and he is informed that the result is positive.  The patient resists disclosure to his wife because he has not told her about his extramarital sexual partners.  The physician informs the patient that his wife's right to know is paramount because she could also be HIV positive.  Which of the following relationships best describes the rationale for the physician's recommendation that the patient inform his wife of his condition rather than withhold this information?  Choices: a) autonomy overrides beneficence b) autonomy overrides justice c) beneficence overrides autonomy d) nonmaleficence overrides autonomy 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the key concepts in the question.  Autonomy refers to the patient's right to make decisions about their own care,  beneficence refers to the duty to do good,  justice refers to fairness and equitable treatment,  and nonmaleficence refers to the duty to avoid causing harm.
 Next,  I need to consider the physician's recommendation in the context of these concepts.  The physician is prioritizing the wife's right to know,  which could prevent potential harm to her health.  This action aligns with beneficence and nonmaleficence.
 The question asks which relationship best describes the rationale for the physician's recommendation.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 10 -year-old boy is brought for a follow-up examination 2  days after he was seen in the emergency department because of hives,  hoarseness,  and light-headedness.  His symptoms began 15  minutes after he was stung by a bee and lasted approximately 60  minutes; they resolved before he was treated.  He has been stung by bees three times over the past year,  and each reaction has been more severe.  Examination shows no abnormalities.  Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation to prevent future morbidity and mortality from this condition?  Choices: a) Avoid areas known to have bees b) Avoid wearing colorful clothing outside c) Carrying diphenhydramine tablets d) Carrying self-injectable epinephrine 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the condition the boy is suffering from.  The symptoms of hives,  hoarseness,  and light-headedness,  along with the timing of the reaction (15  minutes after the bee sting),  suggest that the boy is experiencing anaphylaxis.
 Next,  I need to consider the severity of the reactions.  The boy has had three bee stings in the past year,  and each reaction has been more severe.  This indicates a high risk of future severe reactions.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the options for preventing future morbidity and mortality.  Avoiding areas known to have bees and avoiding colorful clothing outside are general precautions that may help but are not specific to anaphylaxis.  Carrying diphenhydramine tablets is an antihistamine,  which can help with mild allergic reactions but is not the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis.
 Carrying self-injectable epinephrine is the most appropriate recommendation for preventing future morbality from anaphylaxis.  Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis and can be administered by the patient if they experience a severe reaction.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 25 -year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being discovered semiconscious and incoherent at home.  On arrival,  he is stuporous.  His blood pressure is 105 /70  mm Hg,  pulse is 80 /min,  and respirations are 12 /min.  Examination shows cool,  damp skin.  The pupils are pinpoint and react sluggishly to light.  Which of the following is the most likely substance taken?  Choices: a) Alcohol b) Barbiturates c) Cocaine d) Heroin 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical presentation.  The patient is semiconscious,  incoherent,  stuporous,  has cool,  damp skin,  pinpoint pupils,  and sluggish pupil reactivity to light.
 Next,  I need to consider the possible substances.  Alcohol can cause confusion,  stupor,  and hypothermia,  but it typically causes mydriasis (dilated pupils).  Barbiturates can cause confusion,  stupor,  and hypothermia,  and can cause mydriasis or miosis (pinpoint pupils),  but they usually cause a more exaggerated pupil reactivity to light.  Cocaine can cause confusion,  stupor,  and hyperthermia,  and can cause mydriasis or miosis,  but it usually causes a more exaggerated pupil reactivity to light.  Heroin can cause confusion,  stupor,  and hypothermia,  and can cause miosis (pinpoint pupils) and sluggish pupil reactivity to light.
 Comparing the clinical presentation to the possible substances,  the presentation is most consistent with the effects of heroin.
 Therefore,  the most likely substance taken is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 52 -year-old female presents to the office with the complaint of greenish discharge from her left nipple.  There is no history of trauma or fever,  and the patient is not currently using oral contraceptives nor is she on hormone replacement therapy.  Her last pregnancy was approximately 20  years ago.  Physical examination findings are normal except for the green discharge.  The most likely cause of this patient's presenting complaint is Choices: a) breast cancer b) fibrocystic disease c) mammary duct ectasia d) pituitary adenoma 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's age and history.  She is 52 years old,  which is within the typical age range for breast cancer to present.  There is no history of trauma or fever,  and she is not currently using oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy.  Her last pregnancy was approximately 20 years ago.
 Next,  I need to consider the physical examination findings.  The patient presents with a green discharge from her left nipple,  which is a concerning symptom.  There are no other abnormal physical examination findings.
 To determine the most likely cause of the patient's presenting complaint,  I will consider the choices provided.  Breast cancer is a possibility,  as it can present with discharge from the nipple.  Fibrocystic disease can also present with discharge,  but it typically presents in younger women and is not associated with a green discharge.  Mammary duct ectasia can present with discharge,  but it is also typically associated with a bloody discharge and not a green one.  Pituitary adenoma is not typically associated with discharge from the nipple.
 Based on the patient's age, history, and physical examination findings,  the most likely cause of the patient's presenting complaint is breast cancer.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A 15 -year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother because he has been tired and irritable for the past 3  months.  He is a high school freshman and a member of the track team.  He reports that his symptoms began shortly after starting spring training.  He practices sprints 5  nights a week and runs 2  to 5  miles several days a week in addition to leg training with weights.  He admits to being tired and says the training is becoming more intense and that he is a little concerned about his ability to continue on the team.  His appetite has been unchanged.  Medical history is unremarkable and he takes no medications.  He has been your patient for the past 3  years.  He seems more sullen than you remember from previous visits.  You ask his mother to leave the examining room while you complete the physical examination.  After she leaves the room,  he admits that he is worried about some lumps in his groin.  It is most appropriate to obtain additional history regarding which of the following?  Choices: a) Fever and chills b) Mood symptoms c) School performance d) Sexual activity 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the possible causes of the symptoms described by the patient.  The patient is a high school freshman and a member of the track team,  so the symptoms could be related to his intense training.  The patient also mentions lumps in his groin,  which could be related to the training or could be a separate issue.
 Next,  I need to consider which of the additional history options is most relevant to the patient's symptoms and concerns.  Fever and chills (a) could be related to an infection,  but they are not mentioned as a concern by the patient.  Mood symptoms (b) could be related to the patient's intense training or could be a separate issue,  so it is relevant to ask about.  School performance (c) is not mentioned as a concern by the patient and may not be directly related to his symptoms.  Sexual activity (d) is not mentioned as a concern by the patient and is not directly related to his symptoms.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate additional history to obtain is about mood symptoms (b).
 Output: {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: An 18 -year-old primigravid woman comes for her initial prenatal visit at 16  weeks' gestation.  She is not sure about the date of her last menstrual period but says that the pregnancy probably occurred immediately after she stopped taking oral contraceptives 5  months ago.  Maternal serum α-fetoprotein (MSAFP) concentration is increased to 3  multiples of the median.  Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?  Choices: a) Repeat measurement of MSAFP concentration b) Triple screening for MSAFP,  serum β-hCG,  and serum estriol concentrations c) Ultrasonography d) Amniocentesis for measurement of α-fetoprotein concentration 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the patient's history and the elevated MSAFP concentration.  The patient is primigravid and has a possible late or post-ovulatory conception due to stopping oral contraceptives 5  months ago.  The elevated MSAFP concentration suggests the possibility of a chromosomal abnormality or other fetal abnormalities.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the appropriate next step in management.  Repeating the MSAFP concentration (a) may not provide additional information if the concentration remains elevated.  Triple screening for MSAFP,  serum β-hCG,  and serum estriol concentrations (b) is a standard screening test but may not be the first choice if there is already an elevated MSAFP concentration.  Ultrasonography (c) can provide information about fetal anatomy and growth but may not directly address the elevated MSAFP concentration.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate next step in management is amniocentesis for measurement of α-fetoprotein concentration (d),  as it can provide more specific information about the fetal MSAFP concentration and help in the diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities or other fetal abnormalities.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 25 -year-old woman comes to the office because of a 6 -month history of increasingly severe low back pain and heavy menses.  Her temperature is 37.1 °C (98.8 °F),  pulse is 75 /min,  respirations are 13 /min,  and blood pressure is 115 /79  mm Hg.  Physical examination shows no abnormalities.  An endometrial biopsy specimen shows regular tubular endometrial glands with abundant mitotic figures in the endometrial glands and stroma.  Which of the following proteins or enzymes regulate the progression of cells into this phase of this patient's menstrual cycle?  Choices: a) AMP-dependent kinases b) Cyclin-dependent kinases c) Hexokinases d) Lipid kinases 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the question.  The patient is experiencing heavy menses and an endometrial biopsy specimen shows abundant mitotic figures in the endometrial glands and stroma.  This indicates that the cells are in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle.

Next,  I need to consider which of the given options regulate the progression of cells into the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle.  The correct answer is b) Cyclin-dependent kinases.  Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) regulate the progression of cells through the different phases of the cell cycle, including the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

"Input: A 57 -year-old woman comes to the physician because of an 8 -week history of difficulty sleeping,  fatigue,  and muscle tension.  During this period,  she also has had memory lapses,  difficulty concentrating,  and has been reprimanded at work for arriving late.  Over the past 2  weeks,  she has had three episodes of palpitations and shortness of breath that have awakened her from sleep.  Her pulse is 80 /min,  and blood pressure is 110 /90  mm Hg.  Physical examination shows no abnormalities.  Mental status examination shows a depressed mood and constricted affect.  She says that she is no longer interested in activities that she used to enjoy.  She has suicidal ideation without a plan.  Her hemoglobin concentration is 11  g/dL,  and serum ferritin concentration is 140  ng/mL.  Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?  Choices: a) Donepezil therapy b) Ferrous sulfate therapy c) Ginkgo biloba extract therapy d) Paroxetine therapy 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination.  The patient has difficulty sleeping,  fatigue,  muscle tension,  memory lapses,  difficulty concentrating,  depressed mood,  constricted affect,  lack of interest in previously enjoyable activities,  and suicidal ideation without a plan.  These symptoms are consistent with major depressive disorder.
 Next,  I need to consider the patient's hemoglobin and serum ferritin concentrations.  The hemoglobin concentration of 11  g/dL is within the normal range,  but the serum ferritin concentration of 140  ng/mL is elevated,  indicating iron overload.  This is not a typical finding in major depressive disorder,  but it is important to consider in the differential diagnosis.
 The most appropriate initial step in treatment for major depressive disorder is typically antidepressant therapy.  Among the choices provided,  paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is commonly used for the treatment of major depressive disorder.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate initial step in treatment is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A 40 -year-old man with paranoid schizophrenia is transferred to the emergency department from the residential facility where he lives 2  hours after having swallowed a nail.  The patient says he does not have any symptoms.  Medical history is otherwise unremarkable.  His only current medication is haloperidol.  The patient is not in acute distress.  Vital signs are normal.  Physical examination shows no abnormalities.  Mental status examination discloses a flat affect,  distractibility,  and derailment of thoughts.  X-ray of the abdomen is obtained and shows a 4 -cm nail in the left upper quadrant.  No free air is visible.  After admitting the patient to the hospital,  which of the following is the most appropriate management?  Choices: a) Administration of ipecac to induce vomiting and expectoration of the nail b) Observation to allow passage of the nail via normal peristalsis c) Open laparotomy and removal of the nail through a gastrotomy incision d) Removal of the nail through endoscopic esophagogastroscopy 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the potential complications of ingesting a nail.  A foreign body in the gastrointestinal tract can cause perforation,  abscess formation,  infection,  and obstruction.  The X-ray shows the nail in the left upper quadrant,  but no free air is visible,  which is a positive sign.  The patient is not in acute distress,  and vital signs are normal.  Based on these findings,  the nail is likely to pass through the gastrointestinal tract without causing significant complications.
 Next,  I need to consider the options for management.  Option a) is not appropriate because the patient is not in acute distress,  and inducing vomiting may cause aspiration or other complications.  Option c) is not appropriate because open laparotomy is a high-risk procedure with significant morbidity and mortality.  Option d) is not appropriate because endoscopic esophagogastroscopy is typically used for diagnosing and treating conditions in the upper gastrointestinal tract,  not for removing foreign bodies.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate management is option b),  which is to observe the patient and allow the nail to pass via normal peristalsis.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A 52 -year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30  minutes after he had an episode of chest pain radiating to his jaw while shoveling snow.  His pulse is 80 /min,  and blood pressure is 130 /70  mm Hg.  The lungs are clear to auscultation.  Cardiac examination shows an S4.  While undergoing an ECG,  the patient says that he feels the chest pain returning.  The most appropriate immediate treatment is a drug with which of the following mechanisms of action?  Choices: a) Increases cAMP concentration b) Increases nitric oxide concentration c) Inhibits potassium flux d) Inhibits sodium flux 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the clinical scenario.  The patient is a 52 -year-old man with chest pain radiating to his jaw,  which could be a sign of a myocardial infarction.  His pulse is normal,  and blood pressure is within the normal range,  but there is an S4 sound on cardiac examination,  which indicates a possible cardiac cause for the chest pain.  The patient also reports chest pain returning while undergoing an ECG,  which is a concerning finding.

Next,  I need to consider the appropriate immediate treatment for this patient.  The most appropriate treatment in this situation is to administer a drug that can rapidly relieve the chest pain and prevent further myocardial damage.  The drug should have a positive inotropic effect and improve myocardial oxygen supply.

Now,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  a) Increases cAMP concentration can lead to vasodilation and positive inotropy,  which is beneficial in this situation.  b) Increases nitric oxide concentration also leads to vasodilation,  which is helpful.  c) Inhibits potassium flux can have various effects on the heart,  but it is not the most direct or immediate treatment for chest pain.  d) Inhibits sodium flux can also have various effects on the heart,  but it is not the most direct or immediate treatment for chest pain.

Therefore,  the most appropriate immediate treatment is a drug that increases cAMP concentration,  which corresponds to {'sol': 'a'}"
