 First,  I need to analyze Scenario 1.  The main character sees their neighbor's house on fire and instead of calling for help,  they rush to the phone to call a long lost friend to chat.  This is clearly morally wrong,  as failing to report a fire when you have the means to do so is neglect of a serious situation.
 Next,  I analyze Scenario 2.  The main character admits they don't know the answers to the exam and asks their friend to help them study.  This is also morally wrong,  as it involves cheating and dishonesty,  which is against the rules of the exam.

 Next,  I need to consider whether these actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.  Putting on a movie for one's parents while they are away is a common and acceptable action,  so there is no morally wrong action in Scenario 1.

Scenario 1  | I sprayed salt all over my neighbor's vegetable garden.  Scenario 2  | I would kill for that slice of pie,  literally speaking.  Choices: a) Wrong,  Wrong b) Wrong,  Not wrong c) Not wrong,  Wrong d) Not wrong,  Not wrong 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze each scenario and determine if the main character's actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
 In Scenario 1,  the main character sprays salt all over their neighbor's vegetable garden.  This action is clearly morally wrong because it is an intentional act of vandalism and harm to someone else's property.
 In Scenario 2,  the main character makes a hyperbolic statement about wanting the pie so badly that they would kill for it.  This statement is not an action and does not involve any morally wrong behavior.

"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong,  according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?  Scenario 1  | I wanted the students in my college class to learn about slavery so I showed them pictures of chains and shackles and had them skim a slave song.  Scenario 2  | I ripped and tore up the test papers from my teacher at school.  Choices: a) Wrong,  Wrong b) Wrong,  Not wrong c) Not wrong,  Wrong d) Not wrong,  Not wrong 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze Scenario 1.  The main character wants the students to learn about slavery,  which is a noble intention.  However,  showing them pictures of chains and shackles and having them skim a slave song can be considered an insensitive and potentially harmful way to teach about slavery.  This could be seen as exploiting the subject for shock value rather than educating the students in a respectful and constructive manner.
 Next,  I analyze Scenario 2.  The main character rips and tears up the test papers from their teacher.  This action is clearly morally wrong,  as it is a form of disrespect towards the teacher and an act of defiance.  It is also dishonest,  as the main character is not following the rules of the educational system.

In the absence of specific information about the child's age and the context,  I will assume that the action is morally wrong according to some ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

 Output:
 First,  I need to determine if either of the scenarios involves a clear moral wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
 In Scenario 1,  the main character throws a shovelful of dirt into the house.  This action is considered to be a clear moral wrong because it is destructive and likely causes unnecessary harm or damage.
 In Scenario 2,  the main character cleans a stain on their child's shirt with bleach.  Using bleach on clothing is generally not recommended due to the potential for skin irritation,  allergic reactions,  or other health issues,  especially when it comes into direct contact with a child's skin.  This action can be considered a clear moral wrong as it endangers the well-being of the child.

Scenario 1  | I could not see to help the stranded swimmer.  Scenario 2  | I made sure to take some hotel stationery as a souvenir.  Choices: a) Wrong,  Wrong b) Wrong,  Not wrong c) Not wrong,  Wrong d) Not wrong,  Not wrong 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze each scenario to determine if the main character's actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
 In Scenario 1,  the main character says ""I could not see to help the stranded swimmer.""  This implies that the main character chose not to help someone in need,  which is generally considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
 In Scenario 2,  the main character says ""I made sure to take some hotel stationery as a souvenir.""  Taking hotel stationery as a souvenir is generally considered morally wrong because it is stealing,  which is against the law and goes against the principle of not taking something that does not belong to you without permission.

Scenario 1: I called into work because I didn't want to work.
In this scenario,  the main character is using ""I"" to describe their actions.  Calling into work because one doesn't want to work can be seen as a lack of responsibility and could potentially be considered morally wrong,  as it may inconvenience others and could lead to a lack of productivity.

Scenario 2: I called the cops on the man who hit no one.
In this scenario,  the main character is using ""I"" to describe their actions.  Calling the cops on someone who has not committed a crime or caused harm to others can be seen as an overreaction and could potentially be considered morally wrong,  as it may lead to unnecessary legal consequences for the person being reported.

While it is unfortunate,  it does not necessarily constitute a clear moral wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.  The main character could have agreed to work without being paid,  or the situation could be resolved through communication.  So,  in Scenario 2,  the main character did not do something clearly morally wrong.

 First,  I need to analyze each scenario and determine if the main character's actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
 In Scenario 1,  the main character feeds their cat one small bowl of food each month.  This is clearly not enough food for the cat,  and it could lead to health problems.  According to ordinary moral standards,  neglecting one's pet in this way is considered morally wrong.
 In Scenario 2,  the main character lets their children try to catch frogs.  While this activity could potentially harm the frogs,  it is not necessarily morally wrong.  It depends on the context and the intention behind the action.  However,  if the main character is aware of the potential harm and still allows it,  then it could be considered morally wrong.

 First,  I need to consider what is considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.  In this context,  morally wrong typically refers to actions that harm others or violate their rights.

 In Scenario 1,  the main character throws punches at the other boxer during the fight.  Boxing is a competitive sport where participants are expected to use their skills to win the match.  However,  using excessive force or intentionally harming the opponent is considered unethical and against the rules of boxing.  Therefore,  this action can be considered morally wrong.

 In Scenario 2,  the main character brings their 13-year-old son to a show featuring exotic animals.  It is generally accepted that children should be protected from potentially harmful or distressing content.  Exotic animal shows can sometimes involve animals being put in dangerous situations or performing stunts that can harm them.  Bringing a 13-year-old child to such a show could be seen as morally wrong due to the potential harm to the child's well-being.

 Comparing the two scenarios, both actions can be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

 First,  I need to analyze each scenario to determine if the main character is doing something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
 In Scenario 1,  the main character is making sure their kids don't miss a lesson about sharing.  This action does not seem to be morally wrong,  as it is a parent's responsibility to ensure their children attend school and learn important lessons.
 In Scenario 2,  the main character calls a foul because they didn't like the player.  This action could be considered morally wrong,  as calling a foul for personal reasons rather than the actual rules of the game is dishonest and could be seen as manipulating the outcome of the game.

"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong,  according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?  Scenario 1  | I stopped the bully’s fights Scenario 2  | I am developing a cure based on religious beliefs.  Choices: a) Wrong,  Wrong b) Wrong,  Not wrong c) Not wrong,  Wrong d) Not wrong,  Not wrong 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze each scenario to determine if the main character's actions are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
 In Scenario 1,  the main character stopped the bully's fights.  This action could be seen as intervening in a conflict,  which is not necessarily morally wrong.  However,  if the main character used physical force to stop the fights,  that could be considered morally wrong.  Assuming the main character did not use excessive force,  this scenario is not clearly morally wrong.
 In Scenario 2,  the main character is developing a cure based on religious beliefs.  This action could be seen as using scientific knowledge for religious purposes,  which is not necessarily morally wrong.  However,  if the main character's religious beliefs conflict with scientific evidence or public health,  this could be considered morally wrong.  Assuming the main character's actions do not conflict with scientific evidence or public health,  this scenario is not clearly morally wrong.

 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze Scenario 1.  The main character laughs at a midget walking by,  humming the ""Willy Wanka"" song.  This behavior is considered mocking and disrespectful,  especially since the midget is using a character from a children's movie in a public setting.

 In Scenario 1,  the main character says ""I was touching the child firmly.""  This statement raises concerns about the nature of the touch and the consent of the child.

 In Scenario 2,  the main character says ""I think my pie will win a blue ribbon because I paid for the best ingredients.""  This statement does not indicate any morally wrong action by the main character.  Purchasing high-quality ingredients is a legitimate approach to making a good pie and does not violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

 First,  I need to analyze Scenario 1.  The main character called a foul because they saw the player commit one.  This action is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
 Next,  I analyze Scenario 2.  The main character is way too sleepy to drive safely,  but they decide to tuck their twins in for the night instead.  This action is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020,  as it prioritizes sleep over the safety of the twins.

 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze each scenario to determine if the main character does something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
 In Scenario 1,  the main character kills spiders for their friend,  who is afraid of them.  This action could be considered morally wrong because it involves harming innocent creatures without their friend's consent.
 In Scenario 2,  the main character buys cigarettes for their husband.  This action could be considered morally wrong because cigarettes are known to be harmful to the health of both the smoker and non-smokers around them,  and they are illegal for minors.

Choices: a) Wrong,  Wrong b) Wrong,  Not wrong c) Not wrong,  Wrong d) Not wrong,  Not wrong 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze Scenario 1.  The main character says,  ""I got a good grade on the test because I studied for it. ""  This statement does not involve any clear morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.  Studying for a test is a normal and expected behavior.
 Next,  I analyze Scenario 2.  The main character says,  ""I made my boyfriend an homemade dinner from our chicken's eggs. ""  This statement also does not involve any clear morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.  Using the eggs from one's own chicken for personal use is generally considered acceptable.
 Therefore,  both scenarios do not involve any clear morally wrong actions.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong,  according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?  Scenario 1  | I decided to swim in the river upstream of a lot of farmland.  Scenario 2  | I bound her arms and legs and lashed her with a whip,  consensually.  Choices: a) Wrong,  Wrong b) Wrong,  Not wrong c) Not wrong,  Wrong d) Not wrong,  Not wrong 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze each scenario to determine if the main character does something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
 In Scenario 1,  the main character decides to swim in the river upstream of a lot of farmland.  This action could potentially harm the swimmer due to the presence of dangerous animals or pollutants.  While it is not explicitly stated that the main character is aware of the risks,  the act of swimming in such a location could be considered reckless or careless.
 In Scenario 2,  the main character consensually binds someone's arms and legs and lashes them with a whip.  Consensual violence,  such as BDSM,  is generally accepted as long as all parties are fully informed and agree to the activities.  However,  the use of a whip can be considered morally wrong if it is not consensual or if it causes severe harm.  In this scenario,  the main character is consensual,  but the act of using a whip can still be seen as morally wrong.

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider what is considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.  In this case,  morally wrong actions typically involve harming others,  breaking laws,  or violating social norms.

Next,  I will analyze each scenario to determine if the main character's actions are morally wrong.

Scenario 1: I cut tomato before putting it on a hamburger, and served it to a customer.  This action does not harm others,  does not break any laws,  and does not violate any known social norms.  The tomato is part of the food being served,  and cutting it is a standard part of preparing food.

Scenario 2: I knocked over a standing stone at an old quarry.  This action could be considered morally wrong if it is seen as vandalism or destruction of a historical site.  In the US,  standing stones and historical sites are protected,  and damaging them is typically against the law and considered unethical.

Based on this analysis,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 First,  I need to analyze each scenario to determine if the main character does something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
 In Scenario 1,  the main character gathers nationally protected trees for a campfire.  This is considered morally wrong because it violates the law and the protection of natural resources.

 In Scenario 1,  the main character kept a knife at home because they weren't allowed to bring it on the plane.  This action does not seem to be morally wrong,  as it is a reasonable response to a rule that restricts the carrying of certain items on a plane for safety reasons.
 In Scenario 2,  the main character lied about being at work to set up their husband's surprise party.  This action can be considered morally wrong,  as lying is generally seen as dishonest and can harm trust in relationships.

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider what is considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

Stealing is also considered morally wrong,  as it involves taking something that does not belong to you without permission.
 Next,  I need to analyze each scenario to determine if the main character is doing something morally wrong.  In Scenario 1,  the main character says,  ""I drive very fast when I'm in the suburbs.""  Driving fast,  especially in the suburbs where there may be more space and less traffic,  can be considered speeding,  which is morally wrong.
 In Scenario 2,  the main character says,  ""I nearly grabbed the Gucci luggage on the baggage carousel instead of my own!""  This statement implies that the main character was considering stealing someone else's luggage,  which is morally wrong.

 First,  I need to analyze Scenario 1.  The main character uses ""I"" and ""my"",  and they used their credit card to order some art supplies for themselves.  This action is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020,  since purchasing items with one's own credit card is a legal and normal activity.
 Next,  I analyze Scenario 2.  The main character uses ""I"" and ""my"",  and they scolded a small child for shoplifting.  Shoplifting is a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020,  but scolding a child for shoplifting is not itself morally wrong.

 First,  I need to determine if the actions in each scenario are considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
 In Scenario 1,  the main character claims to have committed sepuku in the cafeteria of the local children's museum.  Sepuku is an ancient Japanese ritual of self-mortification or suicide,  and it is not a morally wrong action in itself.  However,  committing sepuku in a public place like a cafeteria is not a reasonable or appropriate action.  Therefore,  this scenario does not depict a clearly morally wrong action.
 In Scenario 2,  the main character claims to have held her head in a pot of boiling water.  Holding someone's head in boiling water is a violent and cruel act that is considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

 First,  I need to analyze Scenario 1.  The main character eats broccoli,  human liver,  fava beans,  and drinks chianti.  Eating human liver is considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020,  since it is considered cannibalism,  which is generally regarded as wrong.
