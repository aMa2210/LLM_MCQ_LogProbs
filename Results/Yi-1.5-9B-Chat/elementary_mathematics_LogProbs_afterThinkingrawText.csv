"Input: Keiko spent the day bird watching and counted 34  more birds in the morning than in the afternoon.  If she counted a total of 76  birds,  how many birds did she count in the afternoon?  Choices: a) 21  birds b) 40  birds c) 42  birds d) 84  birds 
 Output:
 First,  let's define the number of birds Keiko counted in the afternoon as x.  Then,  the number of birds she counted in the morning would be x + 34,  since she counted 34 more birds in the morning.
 The total number of birds she counted is 76,  so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 34) = 76.
 Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 34 = 76.
 Subtracting 34 from both sides, we get 2x = 42.
 Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 21.
 Therefore,  Keiko counted 21 birds in the afternoon.

How many flowers did Mitch buy?  d) Stamps are sold in booklets of 20  stamps.  Donna used 8  stamps to send invitations for a party.  How many booklets of stamps did Donna use to send her invitations?  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the situation where the fraction 20 /8  makes sense.  I can eliminate choices a) and c) because they involve multiplication,  not division.  Choice a) is about spending money,  and the fraction would represent the amount spent,  not a division of items.  Choice c) is about buying containers with flowers,  and the fraction would represent the total number of flowers,  not a division of items.
 Next,  I can eliminate choice d) because the fraction 20 /8  does not represent a whole number of booklets.  Donna used 8  stamps,  which is not a multiple of 20,  the number of stamps in a booklet.
 That leaves choice b),  which states that Mr.  Kramer’s 8  grandchildren shared 20  crackers equally.  The fraction 20 /8  represents the number of crackers each grandchild received,  as it is the total number of crackers (20) divided by the number of grandchildren (8).

"Input: At the beginning of a class period,  half of the students in a class go to the library.  Later in the period,  half of the remaining students go to the computer lab.  If there are 8  students remaining in the class,  how many students were originally in the class?  Choices: a) 12  students b) 16  students c) 24  students d) 32  students 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the number of students who remained after going to the computer lab.  According to the problem,  8  students are left in the class.
 Next,  I need to find out how many students went to the computer lab.  Since half of the remaining students went to the computer lab,  the number of students who went to the computer lab is 8  ÷ 2  = 4  students.
 Now,  I need to find out how many students were in the class before the students went to the computer lab.  Since 4  students went to the computer lab,  the total number of students before going to the computer lab was 4  + 8  = 12  students.
 Finally,  I need to find out how many students were originally in the class before half of them went to the library.  Since 12  students were in the class after half of them went to the library,  the original number of students was 12  ÷ 2  = 6  students.
 However,  this answer is not among the given choices.  It seems there was a mistake in my calculations.  Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The correct approach is to start with the number of students remaining in the class, which is 8. This represents the students who did not go to the computer lab. Since half of the remaining students went to the computer lab, the number of students who went to the computer lab is 8 * 2 = 16.

"Input: Peter is in a group of 25  people.  All 25  people went fishing in boats.  There were 5  people in each boat.  How can Peter find the number of boats the group used?  Choices: a) Add 5  to 25  b) Divide 25  by 5  c) Multiply 25  by 5  d) Subtract 5  from 25  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine how many boats are needed for 25  people if each boat can hold 5  people.
 To find the number of boats,  I can divide the total number of people by the number of people per boat: 25  ÷ 5  = 5  boats.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
