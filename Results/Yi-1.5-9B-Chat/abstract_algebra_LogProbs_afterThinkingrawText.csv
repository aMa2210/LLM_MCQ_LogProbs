"Input: Find the degree for the given field extension Q(sqrt(2 ),  sqrt(3 ),  sqrt(18 )) over Q.  Choices: a) 0  b) 4  c) 2  d) 6  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the degree of each individual extension.  The extension Q(sqrt(2 )) over Q is of degree 2,  since sqrt(2 ) is a root of the polynomial x^2 - 2.
 The extension Q(sqrt(3 )) over Q is also of degree 2,  for the same reason.
 Now,  I need to consider the extension Q(sqrt(18 )) over Q.  Since sqrt(18 ) = sqrt(2 ) * sqrt(3 ),  this extension is actually the same as Q(sqrt(2 ),  sqrt(3 )) over Q.
 The degree of this extension is the product of the degrees of the individual extensions,  so it is 2 * 2 = 4.
 Finally,  I need to consider the degree of the entire extension Q(sqrt(2 ),  sqrt(3 ),  sqrt(18 )) over Q.  Since the extension is generated by the roots of the polynomials x^2 - 2, x^2 - 3, and x^2 - 18,  the degree of the extension is the product of the degrees of these individual extensions,  which is 2 * 2 * 4 = 16.

"Input: Let p = (1,  2,  5,  4 )(2,  3 ) in S_5  .  Find the index of <p>  in S_5.  Choices: a) 8  b) 2  c) 24  d) 120  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what p  is.  p  is a permutation in S_5,  which means it is a bijective function from the set {1,  2,  3,  4,  5} to itself.
 The notation p = (1,  2,  5,  4 )(2,  3 ) means that p  maps 1 to 2,  2 to 3,  3 to 2,  4 to 5,  and 5 to 4.
 To find the index of p  in S_5,  I need to find the order of p,  which is the smallest positive integer n  such that p^n  is the identity permutation.
 I can calculate p^2,  p^3,  and so on,  until I get the identity permutation.
 p^2 = (1,  3,  4,  5 )(2,  2),  which is not the identity permutation.
 p^3 = (1,  2,  5,  4 )(2,  3 ),  which is p  itself.
 p^4 = (1,  3,  4,  5 )(2,  2),  which is not the identity permutation.
 p^5 = (1,  1,  2,  3 )(3,  4)(4,The index of <p> in S_5 is 5.

 Output:
 First,  I need to evaluate the polynomial for each element in the finite field Z_5,  which consists of the elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.
 For x = 0, the polynomial becomes 0^5  + 3 * 0^3  + 0^2  + 2 * 0 = 0.
 For x = 1, the polynomial becomes 1^5  + 3 * 1^3  + 1^2  + 2 * 1 = 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 7 ≡ 2 (mod 5).
 For x = 2, the polynomial becomes 2^5  + 3 * 2^3  + 2^2  + 2 * 2 = 32 + 24 + 4 + 4 = 64 ≡ 4 (mod 5).
 For x = 3, the polynomial becomes 3^5  + 3 * 3^3  + 3^2  + 2 * 3 = 243 + 81 + 9 + 6 = 339 ≡ 4 (mod 5).
 For x = 4, the polynomial becomes 4^5  + 3 * 4^3  + 4^2  + 2 * 4 = 1024 + 192 + 16 + 8 = 1240 ≡ 0 (mod 5).
 The polynomial evaluates to 0 for x = 0 and x = 4.

"Input: Statement 1  | A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian.  Statement 2  | If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G,  then K is a normal subgroup of G.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I will consider Statement 1.  A non-Abelian group is a group that does not satisfy the Abelian property,  meaning that the group's elements do not commute.  A factor group is formed by taking a normal subgroup N of a group G and creating a new group G/N with elements being the cosets of N in G.  The factor group inherits the non-Abelian property from the original group G,  so Statement 1 is True.
 Next,  I will consider Statement 2.  The normality of a subgroup K in a group H and the normality of H in a group G do not necessarily imply that K is normal in G.  There is a counterexample: the subgroup {e} is normal in any group,  but it does not imply that the group is Abelian.  Therefore,  Statement 2 is False.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

"Input: Statement 1  | If a group has an element of order 15  it must have at least 8  elements of order 15.  Statement 2  | If a group has more than 8  elements of order 15,  it must have at least 16  elements of order 15.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  let's consider Statement 1.  If a group has an element of order 15,  it means that the element raised to the 15th power is the identity element.  However,  this does not necessarily mean that the group has at least 8  elements of order 15.  There could be other elements with different orders that are not divisors of 15.  So,  Statement 1 is False.
 Next,  let's consider Statement 2.  If a group has more than 8  elements of order 15,  it must have at least 16  elements of order 15.  This statement is True,  because each element of order 15 generates a cyclic subgroup of order 15,  and these subgroups are disjoint except for the identity element.  So,  if there are more than 8  elements of order 15,  there must be at least 16  elements of order 15.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Statement 1  | Every homomorphic image of a group G is isomorphic to a factor group of G.  Statement 2  | The homomorphic images of a group G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I will analyze Statement 1.  It says that every homomorphic image of a group G is isomorphic to a factor group of G.  This is true because a homomorphic image is the image of G under a homomorphism, and it can be shown that this image is isomorphic to a factor group of G.
 Next,  I will analyze Statement 2.  It says that the homomorphic images of a group G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G.  This is also true because, as established in the analysis of Statement 1, homomorphic images are isomorphic to factor groups of G.

 Output:
 First,  I need to evaluate Statement 1.  A ring homomorphism is indeed one to one if and only if the kernel is {0 }.  This is a well-known theorem in ring theory.
 Next,  I need to evaluate Statement 2.  Q is not an ideal in R,  since Q is the set of rational numbers and R is the set of real numbers.  Ideals are subsets of rings that satisfy certain properties,  and Q is not a subset of R.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Find the degree for the given field extension Q(sqrt(2 ) + sqrt(3 )) over Q.  Choices: a) 0  b) 4  c) 2  d) 6  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2 )) over Q.  Since sqrt(2 ) is a root of the polynomial x^2 - 2  ∈ Q[x],  the degree is 2.
 Next,  I need to determine the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(3 )) over Q.  Similarly,  sqrt(3 ) is a root of the polynomial x^2 - 3  ∈ Q[x],  so the degree is 2.
 Now,  I need to consider the field extension Q(sqrt(2 ) + sqrt(3 )) over Q.  Since the sum of two elements with degree 2 has a degree of 2 as well (because the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2 ) + sqrt(3 ) is x^4 - 10x^2 + 1, which is of degree 4),  the degree of the field extension is 4.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

 The elements of Z_7 are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.  I will evaluate the polynomial for each of these values.

In the given input, we are asked to find all zeros in the indicated finite field of the given polynomial with coefficients in that field. The polynomial is x^3 + 2x + 2 in Z_7.

First, I need to find the zeros of the polynomial in the finite field Z_7. To do this, I will test each element of the field to see if it is a zero of the polynomial.

The elements of Z_7 are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. I will evaluate the polynomial for each of these values.

For x = 0, the polynomial is 0^3 + 2*0 + 2 = 2, which is not zero in Z_7.
For x = 1, the polynomial is 1^3 + 2*1 + 2 = 5, which is not zero in Z_7.
For x = 2, the polynomial is 2^3 + 2*2 + 2 = 16 + 4 + 2 = 22, which is equivalent to 1 in Z_7.
For x = 3, the polynomial is 3^3 + 2*3 + 2 = 27 + 6 + 2 = 35, which is equivalent to 0 in Z_7.
For x = 4, the polynomial is 4^3 + 2*4 + 2 = 64 + 8 + 2 = 74, which is equivalent to 2 in Z_7.
For x = 5, the polynomial is 5^3 + 2*5 + 2 = 125 + 10 + 2 = 137, which is equivalent to 6 in Z_7.
For x = 6, the polynomial is 6^3 + 2*6 + 2 = 216 + 12 + 2 = 230, which is equivalent to 2 in Z_7.

From the evaluations, we can see that the zeros of the polynomial in Z_7 are x = 3 and x = 2. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Statement 1  | If H is a subgroup of G and a belongs to G then |aH| = |Ha|.  Statement 2  | If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G,  then aH and Hb are identical or disjoint.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze Statement 1.  If H is a subgroup of G and a belongs to G,  then |aH| = |Ha|.  This is true because of the orbit-stabilizer theorem in group theory,  which states that the size of the left coset aH is equal to the size of the right coset Ha.
 Next,  I need to analyze Statement 2.  If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G,  then aH and Hb are identical or disjoint.  This is also true because of the properties of cosets in group theory.  If aH and Hb are not disjoint,  then they must be identical,  since cosets partition the group G into disjoint sets.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: If A = {1,  2,  3 } then relation S = {(1,  1 ),  (2,  2 )} is Choices: a) symmetric only b) anti-symmetric only c) both symmetric and anti-symmetric d) an equivalence relation 
 Output:
 First,  I need to check if the relation S is symmetric.  A relation is symmetric if for every pair (a, b) in the relation,  (b, a) is also in the relation.  In this case,  S contains the pairs (1, 1) and (2, 2).  Since (1, 1) and (2, 2) are in S,  their inverses (1, 1) and (2, 2) are also in S,  so S is symmetric.
 Next,  I need to check if the relation S is anti-symmetric.  A relation is anti-symmetric if for every pair (a, b) in the relation,  if (b, a) is also in the relation,  then a = b.  In this case,  S contains the pairs (1, 1) and (2, 2).  Since their inverses are in S and 1 = 1,  2 = 2,  S is anti-symmetric.
 Since S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Find the order of the factor group (Z_11  x Z_15 )/(<1,  1 >) Choices: a) 1  b) 2  c) 5  d) 11  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the order of the group Z_11  x Z_15 .  The order of Z_11  is 11,  and the order of Z_15  is 15.  Since these are cyclic groups,  the order of their direct product is the product of their orders: 11  * 15  = 165.
 Next,  I need to determine the order of the subgroup <1,  1 >.  This is the order of the element (1,  1) in the group Z_11  x Z_15.  To find the order,  I need to find the smallest positive integer n such that n*(1,  1) = (0,  0) in the group.  Since 11  and 15  are relatively prime,  the order of (1,  1) is the least common multiple of 11  and 15,  which is 165.
 Now,  I can use the formula for the order of a factor group: |G/H| = |G| / |H|,  where G  is the group and H  is the subgroup.  In this case,  G  is Z_11  x Z_15,  and H  is <1,  1 >.  So,  the order of the factor group is 165  / 165  = 1.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

 Output:
 First, I need to find the roots of the polynomial in Z_7 [x]. To do this, I will test each element of Z_7 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) as a potential root.

Testing x = 0:
(0)^3 + 2(0)^2 + 2(0) + 1 = 1 ≠ 0

Testing x = 1:
(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 2(1) + 1 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 ≠ 0

Testing x = 2:
(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 2(2) + 1 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 21 ≡ 0 (mod 7)
So, x = 2 is a root.

Testing x = 3:
(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 2(3) + 1 = 27 + 18 + 6 + 1 = 52 ≡ 3 (mod 7)

Testing x = 4:
(4)^3 + 2(4)^2 + 2(4) + 1 = 64 + 32 + 8 + 1 = 105 ≡ 0 (mod 7)
So, x = 4 is a root.

Testing x = 5:
(5)^3 + 2(5)^2 + 2(5) + 1 = 125 + 50 + 10 + 1 = 186 ≡ 3 (mod 7)

Testing x = 6:
(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 2(6) + 1 = 216 + 72 + 12 + 1 = 291 ≡ 0 (mod 7)
So, x = 6 is a root.

Now that I have found the roots, I can factor the polynomial as (x - 2)(x - 4)(x - 6) in Z_7 [x].

Comparing this factorization to the given choices, we find that it matches option c) (x + 1)(x - 4)(x - 2), since in Z_7, -1 ≡ 6 and -2 ≡ 5.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Find the maximum possible order for an element of S_n for n = 10.  Choices: a) 6  b) 12  c) 30  d) 105  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what S_n represents.  S_n is the symmetric group of order n,  which consists of all the permutations of n elements.
 Next,  I need to understand what the order of an element in S_n means.  The order of an element is the smallest positive integer k such that applying the element k times results in the identity permutation.
 Now,  I need to consider the possible cycle structures for elements in S_n.  The cycle structure is a way to describe the composition of disjoint cycles that make up an element.
 For n = 10,  the possible cycle structures are (10),  (5, 5),  (4, 6),  (3, 7),  (2, 8),  (2, 2, 6),  (2, 2, 4, 4),  (2, 2, 2, 8),  (2, 2, 2, 2, 6),  and so on.
 To find the maximum possible order,  I need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of the cycle lengths.  The LCM of the cycle lengths gives the smallest positive integer k that is divisible by all the cycle lengths.
 For the cycle structure (10),  the LCM is 10.
 For the cycle structure (5, 5),  the LCM is 5.
 For the cycle structure (4, 6),  the LCM is 12.
 For the cycle structure (3, 7),  the LCM is 21.
 For the cycle structure (2, 8),  the LCM is 8.
 For the cycle structure (2, 2, 6),  the LCM is 6.
 For the cycle structure (2, 2, 4, 4),  the LCM is 4.
 For the cycle structure (2, 2, 2, 8),  the LCM is 8.
 For the cycle structure (2, 2, 2, 2, 6),  the LCM is 6.
 The maximum possible order is 30,  which corresponds to the cycle structure (2, 3, 5).
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Statement 1  | R is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q.  Statement 2  | There is a field with 60  elements.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider Statement 1.  If R is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q,  then R is an extension field of Q that contains all the roots of the polynomial.  Since the polynomial has roots in R,  it must be possible to factor the polynomial completely in R.  Therefore,  Statement 1 is True.
 Next,  I need to consider Statement 2.  The number of elements in a finite field is always a power of a prime number.  60  is not a prime number,  but it can be expressed as 60  = 2^2 * 3 * 5.  Therefore,  there is a field with 60  elements,  and Statement 2 is True.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: The inverse of -i in the multiplicative group,  {1,  -1,  i ,  -i} is Choices: a) 1  b) -1  c) i d) -i 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand that the inverse of a number in a multiplicative group is the number that,  when multiplied by the original number,  gives the identity element of the group.
 In this case,  the identity element is 1,  since any number multiplied by 1 is the number itself.
 The given group is {1,  -1,  i ,  -i}.
 Now,  I need to find the number in the group that,  when multiplied by -i,  gives 1.
 Multiplying -i by i gives 1,  since i * i = -1 and -(-1) = 1.
 Therefore,  the inverse of -i is i.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Compute the product in the given ring.  (2,3 )(3,5 ) in Z_5  x Z_9  Choices: a) (1,1 ) b) (3,1 ) c) (1,6 ) d) (3,6 )

 First,  I need to compute the product in the given ring Z_5  x Z_9.
 The product of two elements in a direct product of rings is the pair of the products of the individual components.
 So,  I need to compute (2,3 )(3,5 ) in Z_5  x Z_9.
 In Z_5,  2 * 3 = 6,  and 6 mod 5 = 1.
 In Z_9,  3 * 5 = 15,  and 15 mod 9 = 6.
 Therefore,  the product is (1,6 ).
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The set of all real numbers under the usual multiplication operation is not a group since Choices: a) multiplication is not a binary operation b) multiplication is not associative c) identity element does not exist d) zero has no inverse 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the definition of a group.  A group is a set equipped with an operation that combines any two of its elements to form a third element in such a way that four conditions called group axioms are satisfied: closure,  associativity,  identity element,  and inverse element.
 In this case,  the set of all real numbers under the usual multiplication operation is not a group.  I will go through each option to see which one is true.
 a) multiplication is not a binary operation - This is not true,  multiplication is a binary operation on the set of real numbers.
 b) multiplication is not associative - This is not true,  multiplication is associative on the set of real numbers.
 c) identity element does not exist - This is not true,  the identity element for multiplication is 1,  which exists in the set of real numbers.
 d) zero has no inverse - This is true,  in the set of real numbers,  zero does not have a multiplicative inverse,  since division by zero is undefined.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Statement 1 | Every group of order p^2  where p is prime is Abelian.  Statement 2  | For a fixed prime p a Sylow p-subgroup of a group G is a normal subgroup of G if and only if it is the only Sylow p-subgroup of G.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I need to evaluate Statement 1.  Every group of order p^2,  where p is prime,  is Abelian.  This statement is true.  A group of order p^2  is either isomorphic to the cyclic group of order p^2  or the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p.  Both of these groups are Abelian.
 Next,  I need to evaluate Statement 2.  For a fixed prime p,  a Sylow p-subgroup of a group G is a normal subgroup of G if and only if it is the only Sylow p-subgroup of G.  This statement is also true.  By Sylow's Theorems,  if a Sylow p-subgroup is unique,  it is normal.  Conversely,  if a Sylow p-subgroup is normal,  then it must be unique.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze Statement 1.  The statement claims that for finite groups G and H,  the order of the internal direct product G + H is equal to the product of the orders of G and H.  This is not true in general.  The correct formula for the order of the internal direct product is |G + H| = |G||H|/|G ∩ H|,  where G ∩ H is the intersection of G and H.  So,  Statement 1 is False.

"Input: Find the sum of the given polynomials in the given polynomial ring.  f(x) = 4 x - 5,  g(x) = 2 x^2  - 4 x + 2  in Z_8 [x].  Choices: a) 2 x^2  + 5  b) 6 x^2  + 4 x + 6  c) 0  d) x^2  + 1  
 Output:
 First,  I need to add the polynomials f(x) and g(x).  f(x) = 4 x - 5 and g(x) = 2 x^2  - 4 x + 2.
 Adding the like terms,  I get 2 x^2  + (4 x - 4 x) + (-5 + 2) = 2 x^2  - 3.
 Now,  I need to consider the polynomial ring Z_8 [x],  which means I need to take the coefficients modulo 8.
 The coefficient -3 is equivalent to 5 modulo 8,  since -3 + 8 = 5.
 So,  the sum of the polynomials in Z_8 [x] is 2 x^2  + 5.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

 First,  I need to analyze Statement 1.  In R^2,  a set of two vectors is linearly independent if and only if they are not scalar multiples of each other.  This is true,  so Statement 1 is True.
 Next,  I need to analyze Statement 2.  If V = span(v1,  ...  ,  vk) and {v1,  ...  ,  vk} are linearly independent,  then the dimension of V is equal to the number of vectors in the spanning set.  This is also true,  so Statement 2 is True.

 First, let's consider the set of all nth roots of unity under multiplication of complex numbers. These roots are given by the formula e^(2πik/n) for k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.

Next, let's check if this set forms a semi group with identity. A semi group with identity requires three properties: closure, associativity, and the existence of an identity element. The set of nth roots of unity is closed under multiplication since the product of any two nth roots of unity is another nth root of unity. Multiplication of complex numbers is also associative. However, the identity element for multiplication of complex numbers is 1, which is not an nth root of unity unless n = 1. Therefore, the set of nth roots of unity does not form a semi group with identity.

Now, let's check if this set forms a commutative semi group with identity. A commutative semi group with identity is a semi group with identity that is also commutative. Since we already determined that the set of nth roots of unity does not have an identity element, it cannot be a commutative semi group with identity.

Next, let's check if this set forms a group. A group requires four properties: closure, associativity, the existence of an identity element, and the existence of inverse elements for all elements. We already know that the set of nth roots of unity is closed under multiplication and has associativity. However, it does not have an identity element unless n = 1. For each nth root of unity e^(2πik/n), its inverse is e^(-2πik/n), which is also an nth root of unity. Therefore, the set of nth roots of unity forms a group if and only if n = 1.

Finally, let's check if this set forms an abelian group. An abelian group is a group that is also commutative. Since the set of nth roots of unity forms a group only when n = 1, and a group with only one element is trivially commutative, the set of nth roots of unity forms an abelian group when n = 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Statement 1  | Every maximal ideal is a prime ideal.  Statement 2  | If I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R,  then R/I is field.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I need to evaluate Statement 1.  A maximal ideal is defined as an ideal that is not properly contained in any other ideal.  A prime ideal is defined as an ideal such that for any two elements a and b in the ring, if their product ab is in the ideal, then at least one of a or b is in the ideal.  Since maximal ideals have this property,  they are indeed prime ideals.  Therefore,  Statement 1 is true.
 Next,  I need to evaluate Statement 2.  According to the Correspondence Theorem,  if I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R,  then R/I is a field.  This is a well-known result in ring theory.  Therefore,  Statement 2 is also true.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Let G denoted the set of all n x n non-singular matrices with rational numbers as entries.  Then under multiplication G is a/an Choices: a) subgroup b) finite abelian group c) infinite,  non abelian group d) ininite,  abelian 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine if G is closed under multiplication.  Since the product of two non-singular matrices is also non-singular,  G is closed under multiplication.
 Next,  I need to check if G has an identity element.  The identity matrix is a non-singular matrix with rational entries,  so it is an element of G.
 Finally,  I need to check if every element of G has an inverse in G.  Since the inverse of a non-singular matrix is also a non-ular matrix with rational entries,  every element of G has an inverse in G.
 Based on these three criteria,  G is a subgroup of the set of all n x n matrices with rational entries.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Statement 1  | Every group of order 42  has a normal subgroup of order 7.  Statement 2  | Every group of order 42  has a normal subgroup of order 8.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider Statement 1.  According to the Sylow theorems,  a group of order 42  can be factored as 42  = 2  * 3  * 7.  By Sylow's theorem,  there must be a Sylow 7-subgroup of order 7,  which is normal because the index of the subgroup is the smallest prime divisor of the group order.  Therefore,  Statement 1 is true.
 Next,  I need to consider Statement 2.  Again,  using the Sylow theorems,  a group of order 42  can have a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8,  but this subgroup is not guaranteed to be normal.  The index of the subgroup is 21,  which is not the smallest prime divisor of the group order.  Therefore,  Statement2 is false.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to check if the polynomial satisfies the Eisenstein criterion.  The Eisenstein criterion states that if a polynomial has integer coefficients and if there exists a prime number p such that the following conditions are met:
 1. The constant term is not divisible by p.
 2. The coefficient of the highest power of x is divisible by p.

"Input: Statement 1  | The image of a group of 6  elements under a homomorphism may have 12  elements.  Statement 2  | There is a homomorphism of some group of 6  elements into some group of 12  elements.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider Statement 1.  The image of a group of 6  elements under a homomorphism may have 12  elements.  This statement is true because the image of a group under a homomorphism can have any number of elements from 1 to the number of elements in the group,  and 12 is within that range.
 Next,  I need to consider Statement 2.  There is a homomorphism of some group of 6  elements into some group of 12  elements.  This statement is also true because it is possible to define a homomorphism from a group of 6  elements into a group of 12  elements,  as long as the homomorphism preserves the group structure.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Statement 1  | The homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic.  Statement 2  | The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider Statement 1.  The homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic.  This statement is true.  A cyclic group is one that can be generated by a single element,  and a homomorphism preserves the group structure,  so the image of the cyclic group under a homomorphism will also be cyclic.
 Next,  I need to consider Statement 2.  The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian.  This statement is also true.  An Abelian group is one in which the group operation is commutative,  and a homomorphism preserves the group operation,  so the image of the Abelian group under a homomorphism will also be Abelian.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Statement 1  | If H is a subgroup of a group G and a belongs to G,  then aH = Ha.  Statement 2  | If H is normal of G and a belongs to G,  then ah = ha for all h in H.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze Statement 1.  If H is a subgroup of a group G and a belongs to G,  then aH = Ha.  This statement is not necessarily true.  For aH = Ha, H must be a normal subgroup of G.  So,  Statement 1 is False.
 Next,  I need to analyze Statement 2.  If H is normal of G and a belongs to G,  then ah = ha for all h in H.  This statement is true because the definition of a normal subgroup is that for any a in G and h in H, ah = ha.  So,  Statement 2 is True.

"Input: If (G,  . ) is a group such that (ab)^-1  = a^-1 b^-1,  for all a,  b in G,  then G is a/an Choices: a) commutative semi group b) abelian group c) non-abelian group d) None of these 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the given property: (ab)^-1 = a^-1 b^-1.
This property is known as the commutative property of inverses.
If a group G satisfies this property for all a, b in G, then it means that the group operation is commutative.
In other words, for all a, b in G, we have ab = ba.
This is the definition of an abelian group.
Therefore, G is an abelian group.

 Output:
 First,  I will consider Statement 1.  In a finite dimensional vector space,  every linearly independent set of vectors is contained in a basis.  This statement is true.  A basis is defined as a linearly independent set of vectors that spans the entire vector space,  so any linearly independent set can be extended to a basis.
 Next,  I will consider Statement 2.  If B_1  and B_2  are bases for the same vector space,  then |B_1 | = |B_2 |.  This statement is also true.  In a finite dimensional vector space,  all bases have the same number of elements,  which is equal to the dimension of the vector space.

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the properties of abelian groups.  An abelian group is a group that is commutative,  meaning that the order of the elements does not affect the result of the operation.
 Now,  I will go through the choices one by one.
 a) g = g^-1  for every g in G: This property is true for every group,  not just abelian ones.

If T is injective,  then it is a bijection.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I will analyze Statement 1.  If T: V -> W is a linear transformation and dim(V) < dim(W) < 1,  then T must be injective.  This statement is False.  A linear transformation is injective if the dimension of the domain is greater than or equal to the dimension of the codomain.  Since dim(V) < dim(W), T cannot be injective.
 Next,  I will analyze Statement 2.  Let dim(V) = n and suppose that T: V -> V is linear.  If T is injective,  then it is a bijection.  This statement is True.  If a linear transformation is injective and the domain and codomain are the same vector space with finite dimension,The output is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Find the degree for the given field extension Q(sqrt(2 ),  sqrt(3 )) over Q.  Choices: a) 0  b) 4  c) 2  d) 6  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2 )) over Q.  Since sqrt(2 ) is a root of the polynomial x^2 - 2  ∈ Q[x],  the degree is 2.
 Next,  I need to determine the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2 ),  sqrt(3 )) over Q(sqrt(2 )).  Since sqrt(3 ) is a root of the polynomial x^2 - 3  ∈ Q(sqrt(2 ))[x],  the degree is 2.
 To find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2 ),  sqrt(3 )) over Q,  I multiply the degrees of the two extensions: 2  * 2  = 4.

 First,  I need to find the product of 20  and -8  in the ring Z_26 .  The product is 20  * (-8 ) = -160 .
 Next,  I need to find the equivalent of -160  in Z_26 .  Since -160  is negative,  I need to add 26  until I get a non-negative number.  -160  + 26  = -134 ,  -134  + 26  = -108 ,  -108  + 26  = -82 ,  -82  + 26  = -56 ,  -56  + 26  = -30 ,  -30  + 26  = -4 .

"Input: Determine whether the polynomial in Z[x] satisfies an Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q.  x^2  - 12  Choices: a) Yes,  with p=2.  b) Yes,  with p=3.  c) Yes,  with p=5.  d) No.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the polynomial in Z[x].  The given polynomial is x^2  - 12.
 Next,  I need to check the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q.  The criterion states that if there is a prime number p such that:
1. p divides all the coefficients except the leading coefficient,
2. p does not divide the leading coefficient, and
3. p^2 does not divide the constant term,
then the polynomial is irreducible over Q.

For the given polynomial x^2 - 12, the constant term is -12. The prime factors of -12 are 2 and 3.

Let's check each choice:
a) With p=2, the conditions are met:
1. 2 divides -12 (the constant term),
2. 2 does not divide 1 (the leading coefficient), and
3. 2^2 = 4 does not divide -12.

Therefore, the polynomial x^2 - 12 satisfies the Eisenstein criterion with p=2.

"Input: Find the generator for the finite field Z_7.  Choices: a) 1  b) 2  c) 3  d) 4  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a generator for a finite field is.  A generator for a finite field Z_p is an element g in the field such that the powers of g generate all the non-zero elements of the field.
 In this case,  the finite field is Z_7,  which has 7 elements: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
 I need to find an element g such that g^1, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, and g^6 are all distinct and cover all the non-zero elements of the field.
 I will test each choice:
 a) 1: 1^1 = 1, 1^2 = 1, 1^3 = 1, ..., 1^6 = 1. This is not a generator.
 b) 2: 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 1, 2^4 = 2, 2^5 = 4, 2^6 = 1. This is not a generator.

"Input: Statement 1  | Every permutation is a cycle.  Statement 2  | Every cycle is a permutation.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the definitions of permutation and cycle.  A permutation is a bijective function from a set to itself,  meaning that each element is mapped to exactly one other element,  and every element is mapped to by exactly one other element.  A cycle is a permutation that can be written in the form (a1  a2  a3  ... an),  where a1  is mapped to a2,  a2  is mapped to a3,  and so on,  with an  being mapped back to a1.
 Now,  I need to evaluate Statement 1.  Every permutation is a cycle.  This statement is False.  Not all permutations can be written as a cycle.  For example,  a permutation that swaps two elements and leaves the rest unchanged is not a cycle.
 Next,  I need to evaluate Statement 2.  Every cycle is a permutation.  This statement is True.  A cycle is a bijective function,  so it meets the definition of a permutation.

"Input: The set of integers Z with the binary operation ""*"" defined as a*b =a +b+ 1  for a,  b in Z,  is a group.  The identity element of this group is Choices: a) 0  b) 1  c) -1  d) 12  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the identity element e,  such that for any a in Z,  a*e = a and e*a = a.
 Using the definition of the operation ""*"",  I can write the equations:
 a*e = a + e + 1 = a
 e*a = e + a + 1 = a
 From the first equation,  I can solve for e: a + e + 1 = a,  which gives e = -1.
 From the second equation,  I can also solve for e: e + a + 1 = a,  which also gives e = -1.
 Therefore,  the identity element of this group is -1.

"Input: Find the characteristic of the ring Z_3  x 3 Z.  Choices: a) 0  b) 3  c) 12  d) 30  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the ring Z_3  x 3 Z.  This is the direct product of the ring Z_3  and the ideal 3 Z.  Z_3  is the ring of integers modulo 3,  and 3 Z  is the set of all multiples of 3.
 Next,  I need to find the characteristic of a ring.  The characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer n  such that adding the identity element n  times to any element of the ring results in the zero element.  If no such integer exists,  the ring is said to have characteristic 0.
 In Z_3,  the identity element is 0,  and the zero element is also 0.  To find the characteristic,  I need to find the smallest n  such that n  * 1 = 0 in Z_3.  The only such n  is 3,  so the characteristic of Z_3  is 3.
 In 3 Z,  the identity element is 0,  and the zero element is also 0.  To find the characteristic,  I need to find the smallest n  such that n  * 1 = 0 in 3 Z.  The only such n  is 1,  so the characteristic of 3 Z  is 1.
 To find the characteristic of the direct product Z_3  x 3 Z,  I need to find the smallest n  such that n  * (1,1) = (0,0) in Z_3  x 3 Z.  This means that n  must be a multiple of both 3 and 1.The smallest such multiple is 3.
 Therefore,  the characteristic of the ring Z_3  x 3 Z is 3.

 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze Statement 1.  An abelian group of order 45  cannot have a subgroup of order 10,  because the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group.  45  is not divisible by 10,  so this statement is False.
 Next,  I need to analyze Statement 2.  A subgroup H of a group G is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of H is equal to the number of right cosets of H.  This is a well-known theorem in group theory,  so this statement is True.

 First,  I need to consider Statement 1.  An integral domain with characteristic 0  means that there is no positive integer n  such that n  * 1  = 0.  This implies that the domain is infinite,  since there are infinitely many distinct elements in the domain.  So,  Statement 1 is true.
 Next,  I need to consider Statement 2.  An integral domain with prime characteristic p  means that the domain has p  elements,  since the characteristic of the domain is the smallest positive integer n  such that n  * 1  = 0,  and since p  is prime,  the domain is finite.  So,  Statement 2 is true.

Statement 2  | The function f must necessarily be surjective.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  let's analyze Statement 1.  The statement says that the function f must necessarily be injective.  An injective function is one where each element in the domain (A) is mapped to a unique element in the codomain (B).  In this case,  the condition g(f(a)) = a implies that for every a in A,  f(a) is a unique element in B,  since g(f(a)) returns the original element a.  Therefore,  Statement 1 is True.

 Now,  let's analyze Statement 2.  The statement says that the function f must necessarily be surjective.  A surjective function is one where every element in the codomain (B) is mapped to by at least one element in the domain (A).  The given condition g(f(a)) = a does not provide any information about whether every element in B is mapped to by an element in A.  Therefore,  Statement 2 is False.

 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze Statement 1.  It says that for any two groups G and G',  there exists a homomorphism of G into G'.  This is true because of the concept of the ""universal property of the homomorphism"",  which guarantees the existence of a homomorphism between any two groups.
 Next,  I need to analyze Statement 2.  It says that every homomorphism is a one-to-one map.  This is false because a homomorphism does not necessarily have to be one-to-one.  For example,  the zero map from a group G to any of its subgroups is a homomorphism but not one-to-one.

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider Statement 1.  A homomorphism may have an empty kernel.  This statement is true.  An empty kernel means that the homomorphism is injective.  A homomorphism can indeed be injective,  so Statement 1 is true.
 Next,  I need to consider Statement 2.  It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group.  This statement is false.  It is possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism from a finite group to an infinite group.  For example,  consider the homomorphism from the cyclic group of order 2 into the cyclic group of order 4,  where the generator of the cyclic group of order 2 is mapped to the generator of the cyclic group of order 4.

 First,  I need to determine when Z_3 [x]/(x^3  + x^2  + c) is a field.  A field is a ring where every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.
 For Z_3 [x]/(x^3  + x^2  + c) to be a field,  the polynomial x^3  + x^2  + c must be irreducible over Z_3 .  An irreducible polynomial is one that cannot be factored into polynomials of lower degrees.
 I will test each choice to see if it makes x^3  + x^2  + c irreducible over Z_3 .
 a) If c = 0,  then x^3  + x^2  + 0 = x^2(x + 1), which is reducible.
 b) If c = 2,  then x^3  + x^2  + 2 is irreducible over Z_3 .
 c) If c = 1,  then x^3  + x^2  + 1 is irreducible over Z_3 .

 A polynomial is irreducible if it cannot be factored into non-constant polynomials of lower degree.
 To check for irreducibility,  I can use the Eisenstein's Criterion,  which states that if a polynomial has a constant term of 0 and a leading coefficient of 1,  and if there is a prime number p that divides all the coefficients except the leading coefficient,  then the polynomial is irreducible over the field of fractions.
 In this case,  the prime number p is 3,  and it does not divide the constant term 1.
 So,  the polynomial x^3  + cx^2  + 1  is irreducible over Z_3  for all values of c except when c = 0,  2,  or 1,  because these values would make the polynomial divisible by x + 1,  x + 2,  or x,  respectively.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: In the group G = {2,  4,  6,  8 ) under multiplication modulo 10,  the identity element is Choices: a) 6  b) 8  c) 4  d) 2  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the element that,  when multiplied with any element in the group,  gives the same element.  This is the identity element.
 For multiplication modulo 10,  the identity element is 1,  because any number multiplied by 1  remains unchanged.
 However,  since we are looking for an element in the group G = {2,  4,  6,  8 },  we need to find the equivalent of 1  in this group.
 To do this,  I will check each element in the group and see if it,  when multiplied with any other element in the group,  gives the same element.
 For 2,  2 * 2 = 4,  2 * 4 = 8,  2 * 6 = 2,  and 2 * 8 = 6.  So,  2 is not the identity element.
 For 4,  4 * 2 = 8,  4 * 4 = 6,  4 * 6 = 4,  and 4 * 8 = 2.  So,  4 is not the identity element.
 For 6,  6 * 2 = 2,  6 * 4 = 8,  6 * 6 = 4,  and 6 * 8 = 6.  So,  6 is not the identity element.
 For 8,  8 * 2 = 4,  8 * 4 = 6,  8 * 6 = 8,  and 8 * 8 = 2.  So,  8 is not the identity element.
 None of the elements in the group G = {2,  4,  6,  8 } is equivalent to 1  under multiplication modulo 10.
 Therefore,  the group G = {2,  4,  6,  8 } does not have an identity element under multiplication modulo 10.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'None'}"
"Input: Statement 1  | If G,  H and K are groups of order 4,  at least two of them are isomorphic.  Statement 2  | If Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n,  then r divides m and s divides n.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  let's consider Statement 1.  There are three groups of order 4: Z_4,  Z_2 + Z_2,  and the Klein four-group K.  Since there are only three groups and four groups are given,  by the Pigeonhole Principle,  at least two of them must be isomorphic to the same group.  Therefore,  Statement 1 is True.
 Next,  let's consider Statement 2.  This statement is a well-known result in group theory,  known as the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups.  It states that if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n,  then r divides m and s divides n.  Therefore,  Statement 2 is True.

 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2 )) over Q.  This means I need to find the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2 ) over Q.
 The minimal polynomial is the polynomial of lowest degree that has sqrt(2 ) as a root.  In this case,  the polynomial is x^2 - 2.
 The degree of this polynomial is 2.

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider Statement 1: Every free abelian group is torsion free.  This statement is true.  A free abelian group is one that can be expressed as a direct sum of infinite cyclic groups, and by definition,  these groups are torsion-free.
 Next,  I need to consider Statement 2: Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group.  This statement is also true.  According to the structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups,  a torsion-free abelian group that is finitely generated can be expressed as a direct sum of copies of the integers, which is a free abelian group.

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what it means for a polynomial to be irreducible.  A polynomial is irreducible over a certain field if it cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with coefficients in that field.
 Now,  I will consider each statement separately.
 Statement 1: 4 x - 2  is irreducible over Z.  Z represents the set of integers.  Since 4 x - 2  can be factored as 2  (2 x - 1),  it is not irreducible over Z because it can be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients.
 Statement 2: 4 x - 2  is irreducible over Q.  Q represents the set of rational numbers.  4 x - 2  cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with rational coefficients, so it is irreducible over Q.

"Input: Find the generator for the finite field Z_11.  Choices: a) 1  b) 2  c) 3  d) 4  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a generator for a finite field is.  A generator for a finite field Z_p is an element g in the field such that the powers of g generate all the non-zero elements of the field.
 Next,  I need to check each choice to see if it is a generator for Z_11.  I will do this by calculating the powers of each choice modulo 11 and checking if they generate all the non-zero elements of Z_11.
 For choice a) 1,  the powers of 1 modulo 11 are all 1,  so it does not generate all the non-zero elements of Z_11.
 For choice b) 2,  I will calculate the powers of 2 modulo 11: 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, 2^4 = 5, 2^5 = 10, 2^6 = 9, 2^7 = 7, 2^8 = 3, 2^9 = 6, 2^10 = 1.  These powers generate all the non-zero elements of Z_11.
 For choice c) 3,  the powers of 3 modulo 11 are: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 5, 3^4 = 4, 3^5 = 1, which do not generate all the non-zero elements of Z_11.

"Input: Statement 1  | Every group of order 159  is cyclic.  Statement 2  | Every group of order 102  has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider Statement 1.  A group of order 159  is cyclic if and only if it has a single Sylow p-subgroup for each prime factor of 159.  The prime factorization of 159 is 3  * 53.  Since 3  and 53  are distinct primes,  there is only one Sylow p-subgroup for each prime factor.  Therefore,  every group of order 159  is cyclic,  and Statement 1 is true.
Next,  I need to consider Statement2.  A group of order 102  has order 2  * 3  * 17.  By the Sylow theorems,  there must be a Sylow 17-subgroup of order 17,  which is normal since its index is the smallest prime divisor of the group order.  Therefore,  every group of order 102  has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup,  and Statement2 is true.
Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Statement 1  | If H and K are subgroups of G and one of H or K is normal subgroup of G,  then HK is a subgroup of G.  Statement 2  | All groups of order p^2  where p is prime are Abelian.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I need to evaluate Statement 1.  If one of H or K is a normal subgroup of G,  then HK is indeed a subgroup of G.  This is a well-known result in group theory,  so Statement 1 is true.
 Next,  I need to evaluate Statement 2.  A group of order p^2  where p is prime is indeed Abelian.  This is because,  by the class equation,  the center of the group must be non-trivial,  and since the order of the center divides the order of the group,  the center must be the entire group.  Therefore,  the group is Abelian.  So Statement 2 is also true.

 First,  I need to evaluate Statement 1.  The unity of a subring must be the same as the unity of the ring.  This statement is False.  A subring can have its own unity that is different from the unity of the parent ring.
 Next,  I need to evaluate Statement 2.  Every field is an integral domain.  This statement is True.  A field is a commutative ring with unity in which every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse, which is the definition of an integral domain.

Statement 2  | The set of 2  x 2  matrices with integer entries and determinant 1  is a group under matrix multiplication.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I need to check if the set of 2  x 2  matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant is a group under matrix multiplication.  A group must satisfy four properties: closure,  identity,  inverse,  and associativity.  Closure holds because the product of two matrices with nonzero determinant also has a nonzero determinant.  The identity matrix has a nonzero determinant,  so the identity property holds.  Every matrix has an inverse if and only if its determinant is nonzero,  so the inverse property holds.  Associativity holds because matrix multiplication is associative.  Therefore,  the first statement is true.
 Next,  I need to check if the set of 2  x 2  matrices with integer entries and determinant 1  is a group under matrixTo solve this problem, let's analyze both statements step by step:

Statement 1: The set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant is a group under matrix multiplication.

1. Closure: The product of two matrices with nonzero determinant also has a nonzero determinant.
2. Identity: The identity matrix has a determinant of 1, which is nonzero.
3. Inverse: Every matrix with a nonzero determinant has an inverse.
4. Associativity: Matrix multiplication is associative.

Statement 1 is true.

Statement 2: The set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 is a group under matrix multiplication.

1. Closure: The product of two matrices with determinant 1 may not have a determinant of 1.
2. Identity: The identity matrix has a determinant of 1.
3. Inverse: Every matrix with determinant 1 has an inverse with determinant 1.
4. Associativity: Matrix multiplication is associative.

Statement 2 is not necessarily true because closure does not hold.

Therefore, the correct answer is c) True, False.

 Output:
 First,  I will consider Statement 1.  A quotient ring of a commutative ring is formed by taking the set of cosets of a fixed ideal and defining a ring structure on it.  Since the original ring is commutative,  the quotient ring inherits the commutative property,  meaning that the quotient ring is also a commutative ring.  Therefore,  Statement 1 is true.
 Next,  I will consider Statement 2.  An ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 is all of R if and only if 1 is in N.  This is a well-known property of ideals, {'sol': 'a'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the properties of relations.  An anti-symmetric relation is one where if (a,  b) is in the relation and (b,  a) is also in the relation,  then a = b.  A transitive relation is one where if (a,  b) is in the relation and (b,  c) is in the relation,  then (a,  c) must also be in the relation.  A reflexive relation is one where every element is related to itself.  A symmetric relation is one where if (a,  b) is in the relation,  then (b,  a) is also in the relation.

Next,  I will check if ~ is anti-symmetric.  Looking at the given pairs,  I see that (1,  2 ) and (2,  1 ) are not both in the relation,  and the same for (1,  3 ) and (3,  1 ),  and for (4,  2 ) and (2,  4 ).  Therefore,  there are no pairs that violate the anti-symmetric property.

Then,  I will check if ~ is transitive.  Looking at the given pairs,  I see that (1,  2 ) and (2,  1 ) are not both in the relation,  and the same for (1,  3 ) and (3,  1 ),  and for (4,  2 ) and (2,  4 ).  Therefore,  there are no pairs that violate the transitive property.

Next,  I will check if ~ is reflexive.  Looking at the given pairs,  I see that (1,  1 ),  (2,  2 ),  and (3,  3 ) are not in the relation.  Therefore,  ~ is not reflexive.

Finally,  I will check if ~ is symmetric.  Looking at the given pairs,  I see that (1,  2 ) is in the relation,  but (2,  1 ) is not.  Therefore,  ~ is not symmetric.

"Input: How many homomorphisms are there of Z into Z_2?  Choices: a) 1  b) 2  c) infinitely many d) 0  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the properties of a homomorphism.  A homomorphism is a function that preserves the algebraic structure of the groups.
 In this case,  we are considering a homomorphism from the group of integers (Z) to the group of integers modulo 2 (Z_2).
 The group Z has an infinite number of elements,  while Z_2 has only two elements: 0 and 1.
 For a homomorphism to be defined,  the identity element of the domain group (Z) must be mapped to the identity element of the codomain group (Z_2).
 The identity element of Z is 0,  and the identity element of Z_2 is also 0.
 Therefore,  the only possible homomorphism is the one that maps every integer in Z to 0 in Z_2.
 This is a valid homomorphism,  so there is at least one homomorphism from Z to Z_2.
 However,  there are no other homomorphisms because the other possible mappings (mapping 0 to 1 in Z_2) would not preserve the algebraic structure of the groups.

One of these axioms is that the set with multiplication forms a commutative ring with unity.  Therefore,  every field is indeed a ring.  So,  Statement 1 is true.
 Next,  I need to evaluate Statement 2.  A ring has two binary operations,  addition and multiplication,  that satisfy certain axioms.  One of these axioms is that there exists an element,  called the multiplicative identity,  such that for any element in the ring,  the product of that element and the multiplicative identity is the element itself.  Therefore,  every ring has a multiplicative identity.  So,  Statement 2 is true.

 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze Statement 1.  The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial.  If f(x) and g(x) are in R[x],  then their sum f(x)+g(x) will have a degree equal to the maximum of the degrees of f(x) and g(x).  This is because the highest power of x in the sum will be the higher of the two highest powers in f(x) and g(x).  Therefore,  Statement 1 is true.

 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the conditions for a subset H of a group (G, *) to be a group itself.  A group must satisfy four conditions: closure,  associativity,  identity,  and inverse.
 The closure condition states that for any elements a and b in H,  the result of the operation a * b must also be in H.  This corresponds to choice a).
 The associativity condition is satisfied because the operation * is associative in the group G,  and the subset H inherits this property.
 The identity condition states that H must contain the identity element e of the group G.  This corresponds to choice d).
 The inverse condition states that for any element a in H,  the inverse a^-1 must also be in H.  This corresponds to choice b).

 First, I need to find the roots of the polynomial x^4 + 4 in Z_5[x]. Since we are working in Z_5, the possible values for x are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Let's test each value of x:

For x = 0: (0)^4 + 4 = 4, which is not 0 in Z_5.
For x = 1: (1)^4 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5, which is equivalent to 0 in Z_5. So, x = 1 is a root.
For x = 2: (2)^4 + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20, which is equivalent to 0 in Z_5. So, x = 2 is a root.
For x = 3: (3)^4 + 4 = 81 + 4 = 85, which is equivalent to 0 in Z_5. So, x = 3 is a root.
For x = 4: (4)^4 + 4 = 256 + 4 = 260, which is not 0 in Z_5.

Now that we have found the roots, we can factor the polynomial using the linear factors corresponding to these roots. The factorization is (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3).

 First,  I need to evaluate Statement 1.  A free abelian group of every positive integer rank exists because we can construct such a group by taking the direct sum of a given number of copies of the integers.  Therefore,  Statement 1 is true.
 Next,  I need to evaluate Statement 2.  A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if and only if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set.  This is a well-known result in the theory of abelian groups,  so Statement 2 is also true.

 Output:
 First,  I need to find the inverse of a in the group.  To do this,  I need to find an element x such that a*x = e,  where e is the identity element.
 In this group,  the identity element is 0,  since a*0 = a+0+1 = a for all a in Z.
 So,  I need to find x such that a*x = a+x+1 = 0.
 To solve for x,  I subtract a from both sides: x+1 = -a.

 Next,  I need to determine the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(3 )) over Q.  Similarly,  sqrt(3 ) is a root of the polynomial x^2 - 3  ∈ Q[x],  so the degree is 2.
 Now,  I need to find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2 )*sqrt(3 )) over Q.  Since sqrt(2 ) and sqrt(3 ) are both in the field Q(sqrt(2 )*sqrt(3 )),  the degree is the product of the degrees of the individual extensions,  which is 2 * 2 = 4.

 Next,  I apply Fermat's theorem,  which states that if p is a prime number,  then for any integer a,  a^(p-1)  is congruent to 1 modulo p.  In this case,  a = 3  and p = 23,  so I need to calculate 3^(23-1)  = 3^22.
 Now,  I need to find the remainder of 3^47  when divided by 23.  I can rewrite 3^47  as (3^22)^2  * 3^3.
 Using Fermat's theorem,  I know that 3^22  is congruent to 1 modulo 23,  so (3^22)^2  is also congruent to 1 modulo 23.
 Therefore,  3^47  is congruent to 1 * 3^3  = 27  modulo 23.
 The remainder of 27  when divided by 23  is 4.

 In this case,  the ring is Z_3  x Z_3,  which is the direct product of the integers modulo 3 with themselves.  This means that the elements of the ring are ordered pairs (a, b),  where a  and b  are integers modulo 3.
 To find the characteristic,  I need to find the smallest n  such that (a, b) + (a, b) + ... + (a, b) = (0, 0) in Z_3  x Z_3.
 Since the elements are integers modulo 3,  I can add (a, b) to itself 3  times to get (0, 0) in Z_3  x Z_3.

 First,  I need to analyze Statement 1.  The statement says that if a and b are elements of a group and a is not equal to b,  then a^2  is not equal to b^2.  This is not necessarily true.  There are groups where this property does not hold,  such as the group of integers under addition.  In this group,  if a = 1 and b = -1,  then a^2  = 1 and b^2  = 1,  so a^2  = b^2.

Using the associative property of multiplication,  this is equal to a^{-1 }a^{-1 }b^{-1 }b^{-1 }.  Since we are in a group,  the inverse of a^{-1 } is a,  and the inverse of b^{-1 } is b.

 First,  I need to determine if Statement 1 is true or false.  Statement 1 says that S_n is non-Abelian for all n >= 3.  This is true because for n >= 3,  the symmetric group S_n contains at least one non-commuting pair of elements,  which means it is non-Abelian.
 Next,  I need to determine if Statement 2 is true or false.  Statement 2 says that if a is a permutation that is an m-cycle and b is a permutation that is an n-cycle,  then |ab| = lcm(m, n).

 Next,  I need to consider the elements of the ring Z x Z.  Z x Z is the set of all ordered pairs of integers.
 Now,  I need to find the smallest positive integer n  such that the product of n  copies of any element of Z x Z is equal to zero.  Since Z x Z contains pairs of integers,  I can consider the product of n  copies of each integer in the pair.
 For any integer x,  the product of n  copies of x  is equal to x^n.  In Z,  x^n is equal to zero if and only if x  is divisible by the characteristic of Z.
 The characteristic of Z is 0,  since the product of any number of copies of an integer is never zero.
 Therefore,  the characteristic of Z x Z is also 0.

"Input: Statement 1  | For n > 1,  the set {1,2,  ...,  n-1 } is a group under multiplication modulo n.  Statement 2  | There is an integer x such that 63 x mod 100  = 1.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I need to evaluate Statement 1.  The set {1,2,  ...,  n-1 } is a group under multiplication modulo n if and only if n is a prime number.  This is because for a group,  every element must have an inverse,  and this is only possible if n is prime.  So,  Statement 1 is False for composite numbers and True for prime numbers.
Next,I need to evaluate Statement 2.  For an integer x to exist such that 63x mod 100 = 1,  63 must have an inverse modulo 100.  This is only possible if 63 and 100 are coprime,  meaning they have no common factors other than 1.  Since 63 and 100 are not coprime (they both are divisible by 1),  no such integer x exists.  Therefore,  Statement 2 is False.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Statement 1  | If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group,  then K is free abelian.  Statement 2  | If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group,  then G / K is free abelian.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider Statement 1.  If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group,  then K is free abelian.  This statement is true.  According to the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups,  every subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group is also free abelian.
 Next,  I need to consider Statement 2.  If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group,  then G / K is free abelian.  This statement is also true.  The quotient group G / K is free abelian because of the same theorem mentioned earlier.

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider Statement 1.  The external direct product of cyclic groups is cyclic.  This statement is true.  The external direct product of two cyclic groups is cyclic if and only if the orders of the groups are coprime.
 Next,  I need to consider Statement 2.  The external direct product of D_3  and D_4  is isomorphic to D_12.  This statement is false.  The external direct product of D_3  and D_4  is isomorphic to D_12  if and onlyif D_3  and D_4  are cyclic,  which they are not.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Statement 1  | Every nonzero free abelian group has an infinite number of bases.  Statement 2  | Every free abelian group of rank at least 2  has an infinite number of bases.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze Statement 1.  It says that every nonzero free abelian group has an infinite number of bases.  This is true because a free abelian group is a group that can be generated by a set of elements,  and since the group is nonzero, there must be at least one element,  which means there are infinitely many bases possible.
 Next,  I need to analyze Statement 2.  It says that every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases.  This is also true because if the rank is at least 2,  it means there are at least two generators,  and thus there are infinitely many bases possible.
 Therefore,  both statements are true,  so the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Statement 1  | For every positive integer n there is a cyclic group of order n.  Statement 2  | Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I will consider Statement 1.  It says that for every positive integer n,  there is a cyclic group of order n.  This is true because the cyclic group Z_n (also known as Z/nZ) is a group of order n generated by a single element,  and it is abelian.
 Next,  I will consider Statement 2.  It says that every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group.  This is also true because in a finite cyclic group of order n,  the element a^k has order n/gcd(n, k),  where gcd(n, k) is the greatest common divisor of n and k.  So,  for every divisor d of n,  there exists an element of order d in the group.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Statement 1  | If a group has an element of order 10,  then it has elements of orders 1,  2,  and 5.  Statement 2  | If a group has an element of order 2  and an element of order 3,  then it has an element of order 6.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I will analyze Statement 1.  If a group has an element of order 10,  then it has elements of orders 1,  2,  and 5.  This statement is true.  If an element has order 10,  it means that the element raised to the 10th power is the identity element.  Since 10 is divisible by 1,  2,  and 5,  there must be elements of orders 1,  2,  and 5 in the group.
 Next,  I will analyze Statement 2.  If a group has an element of order 2  and an element of order 3,  then it has anThe answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Let A and B be sets,  f: A -> B and g: B -> A be functions such that for all a \in A,  g(f(a)) = a.  Statement 1  | The function g must necessarily be injective.  Statement 2  | The function g must necessarily be surjective.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  let's analyze Statement 1.  The statement says that the function g must necessarily be injective.  An injective function is one where each element in the domain of g (which is B) is mapped to a unique element in the range of g (which is A).  However,  the given condition g(f(a)) = a only guarantees that for every a in A,  g composed with f sends a back to itself.  This does not necessarily mean that g is injective,  as there could be other elements in B that are not being considered in this condition.  Therefore,  Statement 1 is False.

Next,  let's analyze Statement 2.  The statement says that the function g must necessarily be surjective.  A surjective function is one where every element in the range of g (which is A) is mapped to by at least one element in the domain of g (which is B).  The given condition g(f(a)) = a implies that for every a in A,  there exists an element f(a) in B such that g sends f(a) back to a.  This means that every element in A is in the range of g,  which is the definition of a surjective function.  Therefore,  Statement 2 is True.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Statement 1  | A homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel consists of the identity element alone.  Statement 2  | The image of a group of 6  elements under some homomorphism may have 4  elements.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I will consider Statement 1.  A homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel consists of the identity element alone.  This statement is true.  A one-to-one homomorphism means that no two elements in the domain map to the same element in the codomain, which implies that the only element in the kernel is the identity element.
 Next,  I will consider Statement 2.  The image of a group of 6  elements under some homomorphism may have 4  elements.  This statement is also true.  The image of a homomorphism can have fewer elements than the domain, as the homomorphism may not cover the entire codomain.

"Input: Statement 1  | If H and K are subgroups of a group G,  then |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K|.  Statement 2  | A group of order 2 p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I will consider Statement 1.  This statement is a well-known formula in group theory,  known as the product formula for the order of the set HK when H and K are subgroups of a group G.  So,  Statement 1 is true.
 Next,  I will consider Statement 2.  This statement is also true.  A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime can either be cyclic (in which case it is isomorphic to Z_2p) or isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p (which has order 2p).  So,  Statement 2 is true.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: For T: Z x Z -> Z where T(1,  0 ) = 3  and T(0,  1 ) = -5,  find T(-3,2 ).  Choices: a) -19  b) -10  c) 19  d) 10  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the function T.  It takes two integers,  x and y,  and returns an integer.  We know that T(1,  0 ) = 3  and T(0,  1 ) = -5.
 Since T is a function from Z x Z to Z,  it must be linear.  This means that T(x,  y) = ax + by + c for some constants a,  b,  and c.
 Using the given information,  I can set up a system of equations:
 a(1) + b(0) + c = 3
 a(0) + b(1) + c = -5
 From the first equation,  I can see that c = 3 - a.
 Substituting this into the second equation,  I get a(0) + b(1) + (3 - a) = -5.
 Simplifying,  I get b - a = -8.
 Now,  I need to find T(-3,2 ).  Using the linear form,  I can write T(-3,2 ) = a(-3) + b(2) + c.
 Substituting the value of c from earlier,  I get T(-3,2 ) = -3a + 2b + (3 - a).
 Combining like terms,The answer is: {'sol': 'b'}"

 The product is 12  * 16  = 192.
 Next,  I need to find the remainder when 192 is divided by 24.
 The remainder is 0,  since 192 = 24 * 8 + 0.
 Therefore,  the product in the given ring is 0.

"Input: Statement 1  | Every permutation is a one-to-one function.  Statement 2  | Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I will analyze Statement 1.  Every permutation is a one-to-one function.  This statement is true.  A permutation is a bijective function,  meaning it is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).  So,  every permutation indeed is a one-to-one function.
 Next,  I will analyze Statement 2.  Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one.  This statement is false.  A function is a permutation only if it is both one-to-one and onto (surjective).  Just being one-to-one is not enough to make a function a permutation.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Statement 1  | If a finite group has order n then the group contains a subgroup of order d for every positive divisor d of n.  Statement 2  | If a belongs to a finite group then |a| divides |G|.  Choices: a) True,  True b) False,  False c) True,  False d) False,  True 
 Output:
 First,  I will consider Statement 1.  This statement is true.  According to Lagrange's theorem,  in group theory,  a finite group of order n has subgroups of order d for every positive divisor d of n.
 Next,  I will consider Statement 2.  This statement is also true.  The order of any element a in a finite group G,  denoted as |a|,  is the smallest positive integer m such that a^m = e,  where e is the identity element of G.  The order of the group G,  denoted as |G|,  is the number of elements in G.  According to Lagrange's theorem,  the order of any subgroup of G divides the order of G,  and since |a| is the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by a,  |a| must divide |G|.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Find all cosets of the subgroup 4 Z of 2 Z.  Choices: a) 4 Z b) 4 Z,  2  + 4 Z c) 2 Z d) Z

 First,  I need to understand the groups and subgroups.  2 Z  is the set of all even integers,  and 4 Z  is the set of all multiples of 4.
 Next,  I need to find the cosets of 4 Z  in 2 Z.  A coset is a set of the form a + H,  where a is an element of the group and H is a subgroup.
 In this case,  a can be any element of 2 Z,  and H is 4 Z.  So,  the cosets are of the form 2 n + 4 Z,  where n is an integer.
 The cosets are 4 Z,  2 + 4 Z,  -2 + 4 Z,  and -4 + 4 Z.
 However,  the question asks for the cosets of 4 Z  in 2 Z,  which means we only consider cosets that are subsets of 2 Z.

"Input: Which of the following statements is true?  Choices: a) Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.  b) Number of relations form A = {x,  y,  z} to B= (1,  2 ),  is 64.  c) Empty relation _ is reflexive d) Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.  
 Output:
 First,  I will analyze each statement individually.
 a) Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.  This statement is false.  An equivalence relation is a relation that is reflexive,  symmetric,  and transitive.  A partial-ordering relation is a relation that is reflexive,  antisymmetric,  and transitive.  Not all equivalence relations are partial-ordering relations because an equivalence relation does not have the antisymmetric property.
 b) Number of relations form A = {x,  y,  z} to B= (1,  2 ),  is 64.  This statement is true.  A relation from A to B is a subset of A × B.  The size of A × B is 3 × 2 = 6.  Since each element in A × B can either be in the relation or not,  there are 2^6 = 64 possible relations.
 c) Empty relation _ is reflexive.  This statement is true.  An empty relation is considered reflexive because there are no pairs (a, a) in the relation to contradict the reflexive property.
 d) Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.This statement is true.  A relation is symmetric if for all (a, b) in the relation,  (b, a) is also in the relation.  A relation is asymmetric if for all (a, b) in the statement is true.  A relation is symmetric if for all (a, b) in the relation,  (b, a) is also in the relation.  A relation is asymmetric if for all (a, b) in the relation,  (b, a) is not in the relation.  So,  a relation being symmetric and being asymmetric are indeed opposite properties.

"Input: Find the maximum possible order for an element of S_n for n = 6.  Choices: a) 6  b) 12  c) 30  d) 105  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what S_n represents.  S_n is the symmetric group of order n,  which consists of all the permutations of n elements.
 Next,  I need to understand what the order of an element in S_n means.  The order of an element is the smallest positive integer k such that applying the element k times results in the identity permutation.
 Now,  I need to find the maximum possible order for an element of S_6.  Since S_6 has 6! = 720 elements,  the maximum possible order will be the largest divisor of 720.
 The prime factorization of 720 is 2^4 * 3^2 * 2^1,  so the divisors of 720 are 2^a * 3^b * 5^c, where a can be 0 to 4,  b can be 0 to 2,  and c can be 0 or 1.
 The maximum possible order will be when a = 4,  b = 2,  and c = 1,  which gives 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^1 = 720.

 First,  I need to evaluate Statement 1.  Q is an extension field of Z_2,  which means Q contains Z_2 as a subfield.  Since Q is the field of rational numbers and Z_2 is the field of integers modulo 2,  this statement is true.
 Next,  I need to evaluate Statement 2.  According to the theorem,  every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field.  This statement is also true.

 Output:
 First,  I will analyze Statement 1.  If H is a subgroup of G and a belongs to G,  then aH is a subgroup of G if and only if a is in H.  This statement is False.  The reason is that aH is a left coset of H in G,  and it is a subgroup of G only if a is in H.  So,  the implication only goes in one direction.
 Next,  I will analyze Statement 2.  If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G,  then aH = bH if and only if ab is in H.  This statement is True.  The reason is that aH and bH are left cosets of H in G,  and they are equal if and only if a and b are in the same left coset of H,  which means ab is in H.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Find all zeros in the indicated finite field of the given polynomial with coefficients in that field.  x^2  + 1  in Z_2  Choices: a) 0  b) 1  c) 0,1  d) 2  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand that the finite field is Z_2,  which means the coefficients are 0  or 1.
 Next,  I need to find the zeros of the polynomial x^2  + 1.
 In Z_2,  the possible values for x are 0  and 1.
 I will substitute each value into the polynomial and see if it equals 0.
 For x = 0,  the polynomial becomes 0^2  + 1 = 1,  which is not 0.
 For x = 1,  the polynomial becomes 1^2  + 1 = 2,  which is equivalent to 0 in Z_2.
 Therefore,  the only zero in the finite field Z_2  is 1.

 First,  I need to find the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by 25 in Z_30.  The order is the smallest positive integer n such that 25n is congruent to 0 modulo 30.
 Next,  I will test the divisors of 30 to find the smallest n that satisfies the condition.  The divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.
 Testing each divisor,  I find that 25 * 6 = 150, which is congruent to 0 modulo 30.  No smaller divisor satisfies the condition.
 Therefore,  the cyclic subgroup has 6 elements.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The element (4,  2 ) of Z_12  x Z_8  has order Choices: a) 4  b) 8  c) 12  d) 6  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what the element (4,  2 ) means in Z_12  x Z_8 .  This means the element has a first component of 4  in Z_12  and a second component of 2  in Z_8 .
 The order of an element in a direct product of groups is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of its components.
 The order of 4  in Z_12  is 3,  since 4  * 3  = 12  = 0 (mod 12).
 The order of 2  in Z_8  is 4,  since 2  * 4  = 8  = 0 (mod 8).
 The LCM of 3  and 4  is 12.
 Therefore,  the order of the element (4,  2 ) in Z_12  x Z_8  is 12.

 Output:
 First,  I will consider Statement 1.  An ideal in a ring is a subset that is closed under addition and multiplication by elements of the ring.  A subring is a subset that is also a ring with the same operations.  Since an ideal is a subset that is closed under addition and multiplication by elements of the ring, it is also a subring of the ring.  So,  Statement 1 is true.
 Next,  I will consider Statement 2.  A subring of a ring is a subset that is also a ring with the same operations.  However,  not every subring is an ideal,  as an ideal must be closed under multiplication by elements of the ring.  So,  Statement 2 is false.
