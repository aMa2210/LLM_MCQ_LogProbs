 First,  I need to consider the most common ways for a virus to kill a cell.  Dissolving the cellular membrane could be a way,  but it is not the most common.  Inducing apoptosis via caspases is a common way for a virus to kill a cell,  as it can lead to the controlled dismantling of the cell.  Fragments cellular DNA could also be a way,  but it is not the most common.  Totally blocking cellular transcription is less common,  as it can lead to the cell not producing necessary proteins.
 Therefore,  the most common way for a virus to kill a cell is {'sol': 'b'}"

 First,  I need to understand the characteristics of the influenza virus's genetics.  The influenza virus is known for its ability to change its genetic material,  which is RNA.
 Next,  I need to consider the given choices and see which one best describes the main characteristic of the influenza virus's genetics.  a) Genetic reassortment amongst 8  genes,  b) High levels of recombination,  c) Rapid adsorption and fusion from without via a hydrophobic peptide,  and d) High fidelity RNA replicase enzyme.
 The correct answer is a) Genetic reassortment amongst 8  genes.  This is because the influenza virus is known for its ability to mix and match genetic material from different strains,  resulting in genetic reassortment among eight genes.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: The highest risk of HIV infection among drug users in the U. S.  is in: Choices: a) The east coast b) The central United States (Kansas,  Missouri etc. ) c) Southern California d) The Pacific Northwest (Washington,  Oregon,  Idaho) 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the factors that contribute to the risk of HIV infection among drug users.  These factors include availability of needles,  presence of needle exchange programs,  and prevalence of drug use.
 Next,  I will analyze each choice based on these factors.  The east coast has a higher prevalence of drug use,  and some cities have implemented needle exchange programs.  The central United States has a lower prevalence of drug use,  but some states have implemented needle exchange programs.  Southern California has a high prevalence of drug use,  but fewer needle exchange programs.  The Pacific Northwest has a lower prevalence of drug use,  and no major needle exchange programs.
 Based on this analysis,  the highest risk of HIV infection among drug users in the U. S.  is in the area with the highest prevalence of drug use and the lowest availability of needle exchange programs.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A study is conducted to assess the relationship between race and end-stage renal disease pathologists independently study specimens from 1,000  kidney biopsies.  The first group of pathologists is aware of the race of the patient from whom the biopsy came,  while the second group is blinded as to the patient’s race.  The first group reports ‘hypertensive nephropathy’ much more frequently for black patients than the second group.  Which of the following types of bias is most likely present in this study?  Choices: a) Confounding b) Nonresponse bias c) Recall bias d) Referral bias 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the potential sources of bias in the study.  The study has two groups of pathologists with different levels of information about the patients' race.
 Next,  I need to consider which type of bias is most likely to be caused by the difference in information between the groups.  Clearly,  the awareness of the race of the patient can influence the interpretation of the kidney biopsy results.
 Now,  I need to compare the given choices to the identified source of bias.  Creating a relationship between the race of the patient and the pathologists' interpretation of the biopsy results is an example of a) Confounding.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: What is urban yellow fever (YF)?  Choices: a) Part of a cycle of mosquitoes biting humans in cities b) Part of a cycle of mosquitoes biting humans and monkeys in forested areas c) A mutant of the YF virus d) A YF species that has adapted to new mosquitoes 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what urban yellow fever (YF) is.  Yellow fever is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes,  primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  Choice a) suggests that urban yellow fever is part of a cycle of mosquitoes biting humans in cities.  This is partially correct,  as mosquitoes do bite humans in urban areas,  but it does not fully describe the transmission cycle.
 Choice b) states that urban yellow fever is part of a cycle of mosquitoes biting humans and monkeys in forested areas.  This is more accurate,  as the transmission cycle involves mosquitoes biting both humans and non-human primates (such as monkeys) in forested areas,  and then returning to urban areas to bite humans.
 Choice c) suggests that urban yellow fever is a mutant of the YF virus.  This is not accurate,  as yellow fever virus has multiple genotypes,  but not necessarily mutations.
 Choice d) suggests that urban yellow fever is a YF species that has adapted to new mosquitoes.  This is not accurate,  as the virus does not adapt to different mosquitoes; rather,  the mosquitoes transmit the virus.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: The current testing policy of the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization is: Choices: a) “Opt-in” b) “Opt-out” c) Mandatory testing of prisoners d) Mandatory testing of high-risk groups 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the meaning of ""opt-in"" and ""opt-out"" policies.  An ""opt-in"" policy means that individuals must actively choose to be tested,  while an ""opt-out"" policy means that individuals are automatically tested unless they choose not to be.
 Next,  I need to consider the current testing policies of the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization.  Both organizations have implemented an ""opt-out"" policy,  meaning that individuals are automatically tested unless they choose not to be.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Common cold viruses are ubiquitous and invade by which route?  Choices: a) Faecal oral route b) Respiratory and surface route c) Cuts in the skin d) Sexual transmission 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the mode of transmission of common cold viruses.  Common cold is caused by rhinoviruses and coronaviruses,  which are known to be transmitted through the air.
 Next,  I will evaluate the given choices.  a) Faecal oral route is not the primary route for common cold,  as it is not transmitted through food or water.  b) Respiratory and surface route is a likely option,  as common cold viruses are spread through respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected surfaces.  c) Cuts in the skin is not a relevant route for common cold transmission.  d) Sexual transmission is not the primary mode of transmission for common cold.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Assembly is a vital late replication stage for a virus and is often accomplished by which of the following?  Choices: a) Use of cellular scaffolding in the nucleus and cytoplasm b) Snatching cellular lipids and membranes c) Master plan embedded in the viral genome d) Random interactions between cellular and virus proteins 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the definition of assembly in the context of a virus replication.  Assembly refers to the process of synthesizing viral components into a complete virus particle.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice in relation to the process of assembly.  a) Use of cellular scaffolding in the nucleus and cytoplasm - This choice suggests that the virus uses cellular structures for assembly, which is a plausible method.
 b) Snatching cellular lipids and membranes - This choice implies that the virus takes over cellular lipids and membranes for assembly, which is another plausible method.
 c) Master plan embedded in the viral genome - This choice suggests that the virus follows a predetermined genetic plan for assembly, which is related but not the direct method of assembly.
 d) Random interactions between cellular and virus proteins - This choice implies that assembly occurs through random interactions, which is not a plausible method as assembly requires a specific order and coordination.

Considering the three steps, the most accurate description of how assembly is often accomplished for a virus is by snatching cellular lipids and membranes. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: The biggest single determinant of HIV transmission to the infant is: Choices: a) Mother’age b) Mother’s viral load c) Mother’s immune status d) Father’s viral load 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the factors that can influence HIV transmission to the infant.  The options given are Mother’s age, Mother’s viral load, Mother’s immune status, and Father’s viral load.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each option based on the known factors that affect HIV transmission.  Mother’s age is not a significant factor in HIV transmission to the infant.  Mother’s viral load is a known factor that can influence transmission,  as higher viral loads increase the risk.  Mother’s immune status can also play a role,  as a weakened immune system increases the risk of transmission.  Father’s viral load is not relevant to the transmission from mother to infant,  as it is a vertical transmission,  meaning it occurs from mother to child.
 Therefore,  the biggest single determinant of HIV transmission to the infant is Mother’s viral load.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: What does the reproductive number of a virus tell us?  Choices: a) How virulent the infection will be b) How many people will die c) How many contacts will be infected from one case d) How long the 'incubation period' will be 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the definition of the reproductive number. The reproductive number, often denoted as R0, is a key measure in epidemiology that indicates the average number of secondary cases produced by a single infected individual in a completely susceptible population.

Now, let's analyze each choice:
a) How virulent the infection will be - Virulence refers to the ability of an infectious agent to cause disease. The reproductive number does not directly indicate the virulence of an infection.
b) How many people will die - The number of people who will die due to an infection is not solely determined by the reproductive number. It depends on various factors, including the effectiveness of medical interventions and the overall population's susceptibility.
c) How many contacts will be infected from one case - This directly corresponds to the definition of the reproductive number, as it represents the average number of secondary cases produced by a single infected individual.
d) How long the 'incubation period' will be - The incubation period is the time between when a person is infected and when they show symptoms. The reproductive number does not provide information about the incubation period.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: PreP is most effective for which group: Choices: a) Men with frequent unprotected sex b) Men with infrequent unprotected sex c) Women with frequent unprotected sex d) Women with infrequent unprotected sex 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand what PreP stands for.  PreP, or Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis,  is a method of HIV prevention for those at high risk of infection.
 Next,  we need to consider the risk factors for HIV infection.  HIV is more likely to be transmitted from men to women than from women to men.
 Therefore,  the most effective group for PreP is the one with a higher risk of HIV infection,  which is the group of men with frequent unprotected sex.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A special feature of adaptive immunity is: Choices: a) Speed of response to a foreign protein b) Ability to distinguish self and non self c) Ability to distinguish viruses and bacteria d) Short memory 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the characteristics of adaptive immunity.  Adaptive immunity is a type of immune response that is specific to a particular antigen and can be tailored to recognize and eliminate it.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  a) Speed of response to a foreign protein is not a unique feature of adaptive immunity, as both innate and adaptive immunity respond to foreign proteins.  b) Ability to distinguish self and non self is a key feature of adaptive immunity, as it can recognize and eliminate foreign antigens while leaving the body's own cells unharmed.  c) Ability to distinguish viruses and bacteria is not exclusive to adaptive immunity, as both innate and adaptive immunity can recognize and respond to different types of pathogens.  d) Short memory is not accurate, as adaptive immunity has a long-lasting memory that allows for a faster and more effective response upon re-exposure to the same antigen.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: As regards the range of diseases caused by viruses: Choices: a) Each member of the 'family' causes the same disease.  b) Members of many families can cause the same sort of disease.  c) Most virus disease are now controlled by vaccines.  d) Most viruses can cross placenta and be teratogenic.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the range of diseases caused by viruses.  Viruses are diverse and can cause a wide range of diseases, from mild to severe.
 Next,  I need to consider the statement about the 'family' of viruses.  A virus can be part of a family,  but not all members of the same family cause the same disease.  For example,  the influenza virus has different types (A, B, and C) that can cause different diseases.
 Then,  I need to consider the statement about members of many families causing the same sort of disease.  This is true because some families of viruses can cause similar diseases.  For example,  both the influenza A and B viruses can cause the flu.
 The statement about most virus diseases being controlled by vaccines is also true,  as many vaccines are available to prevent viral diseases.
 Finally,  the statement about most viruses crossing the placenta and being teratogenic is not necessarily true,  as not all viruses have this property.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which is the exception in the following range of disease symptoms caused by bunyaviruses?  Choices: a) Pneumonias b) Haemorrhagic fever c) Hepatitis d) Impaired renal function

 First,  I need to identify the common symptoms among bunyaviruses.  Bunyaviruses are known to cause a wide range of symptoms,  including fever,  malaise,  muscle aches,  and fatigue.
 Next,  I need to consider the specific symptoms listed in the choices.  Pneumonias (a),  haemorrhagic fever (b),  and impaired renal function (d) are all symptoms that can be caused by bunyaviruses.
 Hepatitis (c),  on the other hand,  is an inflammation of the liver that is typically caused by viral infections,  but not specifically by bunyaviruses.  While some bunyaviruses may cause liver inflammation,  it is not a common symptom compared to the others listed.
 Therefore,  the exception in the range of disease symptoms caused by bunyaviruses is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: There is no vaccine against HIV because of which of the following?  Choices: a) The virus is so antigenically variable b) Such a vaccine would be too expensive c) The virus can be controlled by a change in sexual habits d) Latency can abrogate any vaccine effect 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the reasons why a vaccine against HIV has not been developed yet.  One of the main reasons is the high antigenic variability of the virus.
 Next,  I need to consider the other options.  While it is true that a vaccine could be expensive,  this is not the main reason why a vaccine has not been developed.  A change in sexual habits can help in controlling the virus,  but it is not a vaccine.  Latency can be a challenge for a vaccine,  but it is not the main reason.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: The requirements for an effective surveillance system include: Choices: a) A diagnostic algorithm b) Staff members c) A sampling frame d) All of the above 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the requirements for an effective surveillance system.  An effective surveillance system should be able to identify and track relevant events or phenomena.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  A diagnostic algorithm is a tool used to analyze and interpret data, which can be useful for an effective surveillance system.
 Staff members are necessary to operate and maintain the surveillance system, as well as to analyze the data collected.
 A sampling frame is a list of elements from which samples are drawn, which is important for ensuring that the surveillance system is representative.
 Finally,  I need to determine if all of the choices are required for an effective surveillance system.  All of the choices (a), (b), and (c) are important components of an effective surveillance system.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: MERS has four special characteristics and here we have one exception - which is it?  Choices: a) Spread by faecal oral route b) Aerosol droplet transmission c) Reservoir in bats d) A conduit to humans via camels 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the special characteristics of MERS.  These are: spread by faecal-oral route,  aerosol droplet transmission,  reservoir in bats,  and a conduit to humans via camels.
 Next,  I need to find the exception among these characteristics.  The exception is that MERS is not spread by the faecal-oral route exclusively.  It can also be transmitted through aerosol droplets.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: The major beneficiary of Medicaid in the U. S.  is: Choices: a) Single men b) The elderly c) Women and children d) Undocumented residents 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the purpose and structure of Medicaid in the U. S.  Medicaid is a federal and state-funded health insurance program that provides health coverage to certain low-income individuals and families.
 Next,  I need to identify which group is most likely to be eligible for Medicaid based on its eligibility criteria.  Medicaid eligibility is based on income, resources, and citizenship or immigration status.  The majority of beneficiaries must be below a certain income level and cannot be above a certain age.
 Finally,  I need to compare the given choices to the eligibility criteria.  Single men may be eligible for Medicaid under certain circumstances, but they are not the primary beneficiaries.  The elderly are eligible for Medicaid, but they are not the major beneficiaries.  Women and children are more likely to be eligible for Medicaid due to their lower income levels and younger age, making them the primary beneficiaries.  Undocumented residents may be eligible for Medicaid under certain circumstances, but they are not the major beneficiaries.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following is the most important for controlling disease caused by norovirus?  Choices: a) A norovirus vaccine b) Attention to handwashing and hygiene c) Quarantine d) New antiviral drugs 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the most effective way to prevent the spread of norovirus.  Norovirus is highly contagious and spreads easily through direct contact with an infected person,  contaminated food or water,  or surfaces.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  A norovirus vaccine is currently not available,  so it is not a practical option.  Quarantine can be effective in limiting the spread of the virus,  but it is not always feasible or practical.  New antiviral drugs can help treat the virus,  but they do not prevent the spread.
 The most important factor for controlling disease caused by norovirus is attention to handwashing and hygiene.  Handwashing can prevent the spread of the virus by removing the virus from hands and reducing the chance of transmission.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Why do vigorous CD8  cell responses in chronically infected HIV-positive individuals fail to eliminate the virus?  Choices: a) CTL exhaustion b) Epitope escape c) Suboptimal CTL d) Absence of dendritic cells 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the question.  The question is asking why vigorous CD8  cell responses in chronically infected HIV-positive individuals fail to eliminate the virus.
 Next,  I need to consider each choice and evaluate its relevance to the question.
 a) CTL exhaustion: This means that the CD8  cells are becoming exhausted due to the continuous fight against the virus,  which can lead to a decrease in their effectiveness. This could be a reason why vigorous CD8  cell responses fail to eliminate the virus.
 b) Epitope escape: This refers to the virus mutating its surface proteins to avoid recognition by the CD8  cells. This could be another reason why vigorous CD8  cell responses fail to eliminate the virus.
 c) Suboptimal CTL: This means that the CD8  cell responses are not optimal,  which could be due to various factors such as insufficient numbers of CD8  cells or a lack of appropriate antigen presentation. This could also be a reason why vigorous CD8  cell responses fail to eliminate the virus.
 d) Absence of dendritic cells: Dendritic cells are important for antigen presentation and activation of CD8  cells. Their absence could potentially affect the ability of CD8  cells to mount an effective response against the virus.

After considering each choice,  it seems that all of them could be reasons why vigorous CD8  cell responses in chronically infected HIV-positive individuals fail to eliminate the virus. Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a, b, c, d'}"
"Input: The most widespread and important retrovirus is HIV-1 ; which of the following is true?  Choices: a) Infecting only gay people b) Infecting only males c) Infecting every country in the world d) Infecting only females 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the characteristics of HIV-1.  It is a retrovirus that primarily spreads through sexual contact,  blood,  and from mother to child during pregnancy,  childbirth,  and breastfeeding.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the given choices.  Choice a) Infecting only gay people is not true,  as HIV-1 can be transmitted to anyone regardless of sexual orientation.
 Choice b) Infecting only males is not true,  as females can also be infected.
 Choice d) Infecting only females is not true,  as males can also be infected.
 Choice c) Infecting every country in the world is true,  as HIV-1 has been reported in every country.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The first acquired immune cell to respond defensively to HIV infection is: Choices: a) CD4 + b) CD8 + c) CD57  d) NK cells 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the types of immune cells involved in the response to HIV infection.  HIV specifically targets CD4+ T cells,  which are a type of helper T cell.
 Next,  I need to determine which immune cell type responds first to the infection.  CD8+ T cells,  also known as cytotoxic T cells,  are responsible for killing infected cells,  but they do not respond to the virus itself.
 CD57 is a marker found on some T cells,  but it is not the first immune cell to respond to HIV.
 NK cells,  or natural killer cells,  are capable of killing virus-infected cells,  but they do not specifically target CD4+ T cells.
 Therefore,  the first acquired immune cell to respond defensively to HIV infection is the CD4+ T cell.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following is a special feature of the rabies vaccine?  Choices: a) The vaccine has not changed since the time of L.  Pasteur b) The original air dried spinal cord of infected rabbits was a killed vaccine c) The vaccine still needs 16  doses given into the peritoneal cavity d) The modern rabies vaccine is grown in human diploid cells from an aborted embryo 
 Output:
 First,  I will consider the historical context of the rabies vaccine.  Louis Pasteur developed the first rabies vaccine in the 19th century,  using infected rabbit spinal cord.  This was a killed vaccine.
 Next,  I will consider the modern rabies vaccine.  The current vaccine is not grown in human diploid cells from an aborted embryo,  as this is a feature of the hepatitis B vaccine.  The rabies vaccine is grown in cell lines derived from fetal cells.
 Now,  I will consider the statement that the vaccine has not changed since the time of L.  Pasteur.  While the basic concept of using a killed vaccine derived from infected rabbit spinal cord was used by Pasteur,  the modern vaccine is produced using different cell lines and methods.
 Finally,  I will consider the statement that the vaccine still needs 16  doses given into the peritoneal cavity.  This is not true,  as the modern rabies vaccine is administered through a single intramuscular injection.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Most viral vaccines are produced by which of the following techniques?  Choices: a) Traditional cell culture b) Molecular biology c) Animal tissues in vitro d) VLPs (virus like particles) 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the most common and widely used techniques for producing viral vaccines.  Traditional cell culture is a method used for producing vaccines,  but it is not the most common technique.  Molecular biology is a broad term that includes techniques for manipulating DNA and RNA,  but it is not specifically used for producing vaccines.  Animal tissues in vitro is another method,  but it is not the most common technique for producing vaccines.  VLPs,  or virus-like particles,  are engineered particles that resemble the virus but do not contain any viral genetic material.  They are used as a vaccine platform because they can induce a strong immune response without the risk of causing disease.  Therefore,  the most common technique for producing viral vaccines is VLPs (virus like particles).
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The treatment of hepatitis C has been revolutionised most recently by which of the following?  Choices: a) The use of interferon b) A new vaccine c) Monoclonal antibodies d) Direct-acting Antivirals such as daclatasvir and sofosbuvir

 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the type of HPV vaccine that is successful and specifically designed to fight cancer caused by human papillomavirus.
 The HPV vaccine that fits this description is the one that consists of the L1  protein of the virus,  self-assembling into virus-like particles (VLPs).
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The rotavirus is an important cause of which of the following?  Choices: a) Respiratory infection in adults b) Gastroenteritis in children c) Diarrhoea and vomiting in adults d) Cancer 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the cause of the rotavirus.  The rotavirus is a virus that primarily affects young children and is known for causing severe gastrointestinal illness.
 Next,  I need to match the cause with the given choices.  Choice a) Respiratory infection in adults is not related to the rotavirus, as it primarily affects the gastrointestinal system.
 Choice b) Gastroenteritis in children is related to the rotavirus, as it is known to cause gastroenteritis in young children.
 Choice c) Diarrhoea and vomiting in adults is not related to the rotavirus, as it primarily affects children.
 Choice d) Cancer is not related to the rotavirus, as it is not known to cause cancer.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: The surveillance testing strategy associated with the least selection bias is: Choices: a) Compulsory b) Unlinked anonymous c) Voluntary anonymous d) Voluntary confidential 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the definition of selection bias.  Selection bias occurs when the sample selected for a study is not representative of the population being studied.
 Next,  I will analyze each option and its potential for selection bias.  a) Compulsory testing means everyone is required to be tested, which could lead to a more representative sample.  b) Unlinked anonymous testing means the results are not linked to the individuals, which could reduce the potential for selection bias.  c) Voluntary anonymous testing means individuals choose to be tested, which could lead to a non-representative sample, as only those willing to be tested may participate.  d) Voluntary confidential testing means individuals choose to be tested, but the results are kept confidential, which could also lead to a non-representative sample for the same reason as voluntary anonymous testing.
 Finally,  I compare the options and determine that the strategy with the least selection bias is the one that most closely represents the population being studied.  In this case,  the least selection bias is associated with b) Unlinked anonymous.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: In a medical class of 147  students,  the distribution of scores on a biochemistry final examination has a mean equal to 67,  a median equal to 76,  a mode equal to 80,  a standard deviation equal to 5.5,  and a variance equal to 30.25.  Three students were unable to take the test on the scheduled date and were given a different form of the exam 1  week later.  Which parameter is most likely to be the least biased estimator of central tendency for this distribution of biochemistry test scores?  Choices: a) Mean b) Median c) Mode d) Standard deviation 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the properties of each parameter.  The mean is the most sensitive to extreme values and can be heavily influenced by outliers.  The median is less affected by outliers and provides a more robust measure of central tendency.  The mode represents the most frequent score but may not be meaningful in this case since there is only one mode.  The standard deviation measures the dispersion of the scores but does not represent the central tendency.

Next,  I need to consider the given information.  The mean is equal to 67,  which is significantly lower than the median of 76,  indicating that the mean is being pulled down by some outliers.  The mode is equal to 80,  which is higher than the mean and median,  suggesting that the mode may not be the best representative of the central tendency.  The standard deviation and variance provide information about the spread of the scores but do not represent the central tendency.

Based on the properties of each parameter and the given information,  the median is the most likely to be the least biased estimator of central tendency for this distribution of biochemistry test scores.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: What disease do herpes viruses not cause?  Choices: a) Infantile paralysis b) Encephalitis c) Sexually transmitted disease d) Cancer 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the disease that herpes viruses do not cause.  Herpes viruses are known to cause several diseases,  such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) which can cause oral herpes and genital herpes.  HSV-2 is associated with genital herpes,  and HSV-1 is associated with oral herpes.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice to see if it is a disease caused by herpes viruses.  a) Infantile paralysis is caused by the poliovirus,  not herpes viruses.  b) Encephalitis can be caused by several viruses,  including herpes simplex virus,  so this is a possible disease caused by herpes viruses.  c) Sexually transmitted disease is a broad term that can include diseases caused by herpes viruses,  such as genital herpes.  d) Cancer can be caused by various factors,  including viral infections,  but herpes viruses are not the primary cause of cancer.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: The purpose of a double-blind or double-masked study is to: Choices: a) Achieve comparability of treated and untreated subjects b) Reduce the effects of sampling variation c) Avoid observer and subject bias d) Avoid observer bias and sampling variation 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of a double-blind or double-masked study.  In such a study,  neither the subjects nor the researchers know who is receiving the treatment and who is not.
 The purpose of this design is to eliminate potential sources of bias.  Observer bias can occur if researchers know who is receiving the treatment,  and this knowledge can influence their observations.  Similarly,  subjects may behave differently if they know they are receiving a treatment.
 Therefore,  the main goal of a double-blind or double-masked study is to avoid observer and subject bias.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

"Input: The basic code of ethical research (respect for persons,  beneficence,  and justice) was first established by the: Choices: a) Nuremberg Code b) Declaration of Helsinki c) CIOMS d) Belmont Report 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the code of ethical research mentioned in the question.  The code consists of three principles: respect for persons,  beneficence,  and justice.
 Next,  I need to determine which of the given choices corresponds to the establishment of this code.  The Nuremberg Code was developed after World War II to address the unethical medical experiments conducted by Nazi doctors.  It does include principles related to respect for persons and beneficence,  but it does not explicitly mention justice.
 The Declaration of Helsinki,  established in 1964,  incorporates the principles of respect for persons,  beneficence,  and justice.  However,  it was not the first to establish these principles.
 CIOMS,  the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors,  was established in 1975 and focuses on the ethical standards for medical journals.  It does not specifically address the three principles mentioned in the question.
 The Belmont Report,  published in 1979,  is the document that first established the principles of respect for persons,  beneficence,  and justice for the ethical conduct of research involving human subjects.

"Input: Randomization of study subjects in a clinical trial is most helpful for controlling for which of the following?  Choices: a) Placebo effect b) Recall bias c) Non-compliance d) Effect modification (interaction) 
 Output:
 First, let's consider each option and its relevance to randomization in a clinical trial.

a) Placebo effect: Randomization helps to balance the placebo effect between the treatment and control groups, reducing its impact on the study results.

b) Recall bias: Recall bias is a type of selection bias that occurs when participants' responses are influenced by their recall of past events. Randomization does not directly control for recall bias.

c) Non-compliance: Randomization can help control for non-compliance by ensuring that the treatment and control groups are similar in terms of their likelihood of adhering to the study protocol.

d) Effect modification (interaction): Randomization does not directly control for effect modification, as it does not address the potential for treatment effects to vary depending on specific patient characteristics.

Based on this analysis, the most helpful aspect of randomization in controlling for the given choices is {'sol': 'c'}"

"Input: It is unlikely that a 'cure' of HIV is possible with current drugs because: Choices: a) Even in combination current drugs do not completely block viral replication b) They do not penetrate to cells c) They cannot block viral transcription from integrated viral DNA d) They cannot penetrate to the CNS 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the limitations of current drugs in treating HIV.  HIV is a retrovirus that integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA,  making it difficult to target with drugs.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  Choice a) states that even in combination,  current drugs do not completely block viral replication.  This is a valid limitation,  as antiretroviral therapy (ART) is used to manage the virus and reduce the viral load,  but it does not completely eradicate it.
 Choice b) suggests that the drugs do not penetrate to cells.  While some drugs may have issues with cell penetration,  this is not a general limitation of all current drugs.
 Choice c) claims that current drugs cannot block viral transcription from integrated viral DNA.  This is not accurate,  as ART works by inhibiting the reverse transcriptase enzyme,  which is necessary for the conversion of viral RNA into DNA.
 Choice d) states that current drugs cannot penetrate to the CNS.  This is a limitation for some drugs,  but it is not a general limitation for all current drugs used to treat HIV.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which viruses appear to be hypermutable?  Choices: a) DNA viruses b) 'Emerging' viruses c) Influenza and HIV d) RNA viruses

 First,  I need to consider which viruses have a higher mutation rate.  Viruses can be classified as either DNA or RNA viruses.  DNA viruses have their genetic information stored in deoxyribonucleic acid,  while RNA viruses have their genetic information stored in ribonucleic acid.
 RNA viruses are generally known to have a higher mutation rate compared to DNA viruses.  This is because the RNA replication process is less accurate and more prone to errors.
 Next,  I need to consider the specific viruses mentioned in the choices.  Influenza and HIV are both examples of RNA viruses.  'Emerging' viruses could refer to any new virus,  but it does not specifically indicate that they are hypermutable.  DNA viruses are generally less hypermutable than RNA viruses.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: How are herpes infections controlled?  Choices: a) Chemotherapy b) Vaccines c) Hygiene and social distancing d) No method 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the options provided and their relevance to herpes infections.  Chemotherapy is a treatment for cancer,  not herpes.  Vaccines are not available for all types of herpes,  as some strains are not easily targeted by vaccines.  Hygiene and social distancing are important for preventing the spread of infections,  but they do not directly control the infection in an individual.  There is no known cure for herpes,  but antiviral medications can help manage symptoms and reduce the frequency of outbreaks.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A new drug with in vitro activity against HIV is tested on a population of patients with Western-blot confirmed HIV infections.  Out of the 200  individuals in the patient population,  100  are chosen by lottery to receive the drug.  The drug,  which is tasteless,  is administered in a cup of orange juice; the other patients receive pure orange juice.  Neither the nurses,  doctors,  nor the patients know which patients receive the drug.  At the end of the study period,  the number of CD4 + T cells is determined for all of the subjects.  This is an example of a Choices: a) Case-control study b) Case report c) Cohort study d) Cross-sectional study

"Input: What is the most successful and most widely used 'travel' vaccine for international visitors?  Choices: a) Influenza b) MMR c) Yellow Fever d) Rabies 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the criteria for success and wide usage.  A successful vaccine is one that provides good protection against the disease it targets and is widely used by international travelers to avoid potential health risks.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice based on these criteria.  Influenza (a) is a common vaccine for travelers,  but it is not the most widely used for travel.  MMR (b) is a vaccine for measles,  mumps,  and rubella,  which are not typically considered travel vaccines.  Yellow Fever (c) is a vaccine required for entry into some countries,  but it is not the most widely used for general travel purposes.  Rabies (d) is a vaccine recommended for travelers to countries with a high risk of rabies exposure,  and it is one of the most widely used travel vaccines.
 Therefore,  the most successful and most widely used 'travel' vaccine for international visitors is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: What is a virus pandemic?  Choices: a) A sharp and rapid epidemic involving more than one country b) An outbreak which recurs again and again c) A rapid global outbreak starting from a single focus d) A characteristic of common cold virus and HIV 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the definition of a virus pandemic.  A pandemic is a widespread outbreak of an infectious disease that affects a large number of people across multiple countries or continents.
 Next,  I can eliminate choices that do not match the definition.  An outbreak which recurs again and again (b) does not fit the definition of a pandemic, as a pandemic involves a widespread outbreak affecting multiple countries.  A characteristic of common cold virus and HIV (d) is not a definition of a pandemic, as it refers to specific characteristics of certain viruses rather than the concept of a pandemic itself.
 Now,  I need to compare the remaining choices to the definition.  A sharp and rapid epidemic involving more than one country (a) and a rapid global outbreak starting from a single focus (c) both fit the definition of a pandemic.
 However,  choice a) is more specific and accurately describes the characteristics of a pandemic, as it mentions the involvement of more than one country and the sharp and rapid nature of the outbreak.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: As part of the Women’s Health Study,  researchers investigated the role of systemic inflammation in predicting cardiovascular disease in women (N Engl J Med.  2002 ;347 [20 ]:1557 -1565 ).  Researchers used a prospective study design with a large sample size.  Blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured at baseline and women were followed for an average of 8  years.  The following table shows the relative risk estimates of cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke) within 5  years by quintile of CRP level for the 30,000  women.  The first quintile is used as the reference category.   1  0.49  mg/dL Relative Risk Number of women  1.0  6000   2  >0.49 -1.08  mg/dL 1.8  6000   Quintile of CRP Level 3  >1.08 -2.09  mg/dL 2.3  6000   4  >2.09 -4.19  mg/dL 3.2  6000   5  >4.19  mg/dL 4.5  6000   Based on the relative risk data above,  one can conclude: Choices: a) There is no risk of heart attack/stroke for women with CRP levels in the first quintile.  b) Decreasing CRP level appears to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke.  c) Increasing CRP level appears to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke.  d) There appears to be no association between CRP levels and heart attack/stroke.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the relative risk estimates.  The relative risk is the risk of an event occurring in the exposed group compared to the risk of the event occurring in the non-exposed group.  In this case,  the exposed group is each quintile of CRP levels,  and the non-exposed group is the first quintile (the reference category).  The higher the relative risk,  the greater the risk of cardiovascular events.

Next,  I look at the table and see that the first quintile has a relative risk of 1,  which means the risk of cardiovascular events is the same as the reference category.  As we move up the quintiles,  the CRP levels increase,  and so does the relative risk.  For example,  the second quintile has a relative risk of 1.8,  the third quintile has a relative risk of 2.3,  and so on.

Therefore,  based on the relative risk data,  I can conclude that increasing CRP level appears to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke.  So,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: What is the morphology of the Dane particle?  Choices: a) Double shelled icosahedron b) Lipid membrane free icosahedron c) Flexuous and filamentous morphology d) Numerous small particles 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the Dane particle.  The Dane particle is a virus particle,  specifically the tobacco mosaic virus.
 Next,  I need to consider the morphology of the Dane particle.  The tobacco mosaic virus has an icosahedral shape,  which means it has 20 triangular faces.
 Now,  I need to match the morphology to the given choices.  The correct choice is b) Lipid membrane free icosahedron,  as the Dane particle does not have a lipid membrane and has an icosahedral shape.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: The adenovirus virion has which unique structural feature?  Choices: a) Icosahedron b) Icosahedron with slender fibres c) 'Complex' structure not yet fully explored d) Flexuous lipid containing structure 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the unique structural feature of the adenovirus virion.  The adenovirus is a group of viruses that have a specific structure.
 Next,  I can eliminate option c) 'Complex' structure not yet fully explored,  since the adenovirus virion has a well-known structure.
 Then,  I can eliminate option d) Flexuous lipid containing structure,  as this is not the unique structural feature of the adenovirus virion.
 Between options a) Icosahedron and b) Icosahedron with slender fibres,  the unique structural feature of the adenovirus virion is an icosahedron shape.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A city has a population of 250,000  cases and 400  deaths each year from this disease.  There are 2,500  deaths per year from all causes.  The prevalence of this disease is given by Choices: a) 400 /250,000  b) 600 /250,000  c) 1,000 /250,000  d) 2,500 /250,000  
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate the prevalence of the disease. Prevalence is the number of cases of the disease divided by the total population. In this case, the number of cases is 250,000 and the number of deaths from the disease is 400. However, to find the total number of cases, I need to consider that some of the deaths could be from other causes. To do this, I subtract the deaths from all causes (2,500) from the total deaths (400 + 2,500 = 2,900). This gives me the number of deaths specifically from the disease, which is 2,900 - 2,500 = 400.

Now, I have the total number of cases (250,000) and the total number of deaths specifically from the disease (400). To find the prevalence, I divide the number of cases by the population: 250,000 / 400 = 625.

However, this answer does not match any of the given choices. It seems there was an error in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the steps.

The correct way to calculate the prevalence is to divide the number of cases by the population, which is 250,000 / 400 = 625. This is not one of the given choices, so there must be a mistake in the question or the choices provided.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'None of the given choices'}"
"Input: Which unique form does the rabies virus take?  Choices: a) The virion has a dumbbell appearance b) It is shaped like a bullet from a gun c) The virus is star shaped d) The virion is very pleomorphic 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the unique form of the rabies virus.  The rabies virus is a member of the Rhabdoviridae family,  which includes viruses with diverse morphologies.
 Next,  I can eliminate options b) and c) because they do not describe the typical form of the rabies virus.  The rabies virus is not shaped like a bullet from a gun nor is it star shaped.
 Now,  I need to consider options a) and d).  Option a) describes the dumbbell appearance of the rabies virion,  which is a common form.  Option d) describes the virus as very pleomorphic,  meaning it can take many forms.  However,  the most unique and characteristic form of the rabies virus is the dumbbell appearance.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following diseases is not caused by togaviruses?  Choices: a) Chikungunya b) Rubella (German measles) c) Western Equine encephalitis d) Yellow Fever 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the diseases caused by togaviruses.  Togaviruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases in humans and other animals.  They are named for their resemblance to the filoviruses,  which cause Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fever.
 The diseases caused by togaviruses include Chikungunya,  Western Equine encephalitis,  and Yellow Fever.  These diseases are transmitted by mosquitoes that feed on infected animals,  such as mosquitoes that feed on infected monkeys or horses.
 Rubella,  or German measles,  is not caused by togaviruses.  It is caused by the rubella virus,  which belongs to the rubivirus genus of the family Togaviridae.  However,  the virus is not a togavirus itself.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
