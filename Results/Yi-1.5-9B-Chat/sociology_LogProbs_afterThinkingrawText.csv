"Input: Mass-society theory suggests that: Choices: a) the content of the media is determined by market forces b) the subordinate classes are dominated by the ideology of the ruling class c) the media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable,  passive consumers d) audiences make selective interpretations of media messages 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of mass-society theory.  This theory posits that the mass media,  through the dominant class,  exerts a powerful influence on the masses,  making them passive and vulnerable to manipulation.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice in relation to the concept.  a) the content of the media is determined by market forces - this is related to the idea that media content is influenced by economic factors,  but it doesn't directly address the mass-society theory's focus on the media's influence on the masses.
 b) the subordinate classes are dominated by the ideology of the ruling class - this choice is closer to the idea of hegemony,  not specifically mass-society theory.
 c) the media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable,  passive consumers - this choice aligns with the mass-society theory's idea that the media exert a powerful influence on the masses, making them vulnerable and passive.
 d) audiences make selective interpretations of media messages - this choice is related to the idea of audience agency and critical thinking,  but it doesn't directly address the mass-society theory's focus on the media's influence on the masses.

Based on the analysis,  the choice that best represents the mass-society theory is c) the media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable,  passive consumers.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The ecological approach to urban sociology involved studying: Choices: a) how social groups colonized different areas of the city and competed for resources b) the forms of wildlife and natural habitats that could be found on the edges of the city c) the way in which people organized collective protests about environmental issues d) how men and women used the city's public spaces differently 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the ecological approach to urban sociology.  This approach focuses on the relationship between social structures and the physical environment.
 Next,  I need to consider each of the choices and determine which one aligns with the ecological approach.
 a) This choice discusses social groups competing for resources, which relates to the interaction between social structures and the physical environment.
 b) This choice focuses on wildlife and natural habitats, which is more related to environmental studies than the ecological approach to urban sociology.
 c) This choice is about environmental protests, which is a political action rather than an ecological approach to studying urban sociology.
 d) This choice discusses gender differences in public space use, which is related to social structures but does not focus on the physical environment.

Based on the analysis,  the choice that best represents the ecological approach to urban sociology is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Becker proclaimed that cannabis use was: Choices: a) increasing throughout all sections of youth in the 1970 s b) learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career c) a dangerous pastime that young people should not be allowed to pursue d) not as enjoyable as other sociologists had suggested 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of Becker's statement.  Becker was a sociologist who focused on the theory of action and the concept of ""normative structures."" In the 1970s, there was a significant debate about the use of cannabis among young people.

Next,  I need to consider each of the choices and evaluate them in the context of Becker's work and the historical context of the 1970s.

a) increasing throughout all sections of youth in the the 1970s - This choice aligns with the historical context of the 1970s, when cannabis use was indeed becoming more widespread among young people.

b) learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career - This choice relates to Becker's concept of ""normative structures"" and how individuals make decisions based on the perceived costs and benefits of their actions. However, this choice does not directly address Becker's specific statement about cannabis use.

c) a dangerous pastime that young people should not be allowed to pursue - This choice contradicts Becker's perspective, as he did not view cannabis use as inherently dangerous.

d) not as enjoyable as other sociologists had suggested - This choice suggests a specific opinion on the enjoyment of cannabis, which is not directly supported by the given information.

Based on the context and the choices provided, the most accurate representation of Becker's proclaimed view on cannabis use in the 1970s is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: The middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century were: Choices: a) an urban set,  involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations b) too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness c) often involved in 'white collar' work d) all of the above 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the characteristics of the middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century.  They were indeed urban,  involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations,  and often involved in 'white collar' work.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  Choice a) describes the urban nature and involvement in civic bodies and voluntary associations.  Choice b) suggests that the middle classes were too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness.  Choice c) describes the 'white collar' work aspect.
 Finally,  I need to determine which choice best represents the development of the middle classes over the nineteenth century.  Choice d) states that all of the above characteristics were present.

"Input: Technological forms of surveillance have made it easier to: Choices: a) access and exchange 'private' information about consumers b) reduce prison overcrowding by the use of electronic tagging c) monitor employees' activities at work d) all of the above 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider each choice individually.
 a) Technological forms of surveillance can indeed make it easier to access and exchange 'private' information about consumers.  For example,  social media platforms collect data on user behavior and preferences.
 b) Electronic tagging can be considered a form of surveillance,  as it involves monitoring the location and activities of individuals who are under supervision but not in jail.  So,  it can be argued that it reduces prison overcrowding.
 c) Employers often use surveillance technology to monitor employees' activities at work,  to ensure productivity and compliance with company policies.
 d) Since all the previous choices are valid,  this option includes all the possibilities mentioned before.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The concept of gemeinschaft developed by Ferdinand Tönnies describes basically the same relational characteristics as Choices: a) organic solidarity b) mechanical solidarity c) gesellschaft d) anomie 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of gemeinschaft.  Gemeinschaft is a social form characterized by close,  intimate relationships and shared cultural norms.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices and their definitions.  Organic solidarity is based on division of labor and specialization,  mechanical solidarity is based on similar values and beliefs,  gesellschaft is a social form characterized by impersonal,  rational relationships, and anomie is a state of normlessness and instability.
 Now,  I need to compare the characteristics of gemeinschaft with the choices.  Gemeinschaft is characterized by close,  intimate relationships and shared cultural norms,  which is similar to the characteristics of mechanical solidarity,  which is based on similar values and beliefs.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: There was a growth in income inequality in the 1980 s because: Choices: a) rates of income tax increased equally for all occupational groups b) there were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them c) the price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings d) growing unemployment made more people dependent on welfare benefits 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the context of the 1980s. This was a period when there was significant economic change, including changes in tax policies, job availability, and the economy's overall performance.

Next, let's analyze each choice in the context of the 1980s:

a) Rates of income tax increased equally for all occupational groups - This choice suggests that the tax system was more equal, which would likely reduce income inequality. This does not align with the observed growth in income inequality during this period.

b) There were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them - While this could lead to higher wages for those in professional jobs, it does not directly explain the growth in income inequality. It does not account for the overall increase in income disparities.

c) The price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings - This choice suggests that while earnings were increasing, the cost of living was increasing at a faster rate. This would lead to a widening gap between the wealthy and the less affluent, as those with higher incomes could still afford to buy more while those with lower incomes would find it harder to keep up. This choice aligns with the observed growth in income inequality during this period.

d) Growing unemployment made more people dependent on welfare benefits - While unemployment and welfare dependency could be factors in income inequality, this choice does not directly explain the growth in income inequality during the 1980s. It does not account for the overall increase in income disparities observed during this time.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: If a deviant act is 'normalized',  it is: Choices: a) recognised as breaking an important norm of behaviour b) seen a temporary aberration from an otherwise 'normal' character c) the first step in establishing a deviant career d) attributed to the person's genetic or anatomical make up 
 Output:
 First,  let's understand the term 'normalized' in the context of deviant acts.  Normalization means to treat something as acceptable or common,  making it part of the norm.
 Next,  we need to consider each choice and see which one aligns with the definition of normalization.
 a) If a deviant act is 'normalized',  it means it is no longer seen as breaking an important norm of behavior,  so this choice is consistent with normalization.
 b) This choice suggests that a deviant act is seen as a temporary aberration,  which does not align with normalization,  as normalization makes it acceptable.
 c) This choice implies that normalization is the first step in establishing a deviant career,  which is not consistent with the definition of normalization.
 d) This choice suggests that normalization is attributed to genetic or anatomical make-up,  which is not relevant to the concept of normalization.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: In the debate about the 'managerial revolution',  John Scott (1997 ) argued that: Choices: a) owners still exercised control through groups of shareholders and interlocking directorships b) ownership and management were becoming increasingly separate functions c) the techniques of scientific management were overly bureaucratic and inefficient d) managers were becoming dissatisfied with their working conditions and planned to overthrow the owners of businesses 
 Output:
 First,  I need to recall the main argument of John Scott's 1997  paper on the 'managerial revolution'.  The paper argues that there was a shift in the relationship between ownership and management during this period.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice in the context of the 'managerial revolution'.  Choice a) discusses the continued exercise of control through shareholders and interlocking directorships, which does not align with the idea of a revolution where ownership and management roles were changing.
 Choice b) suggests that ownership and management were becoming increasingly separate functions, which aligns with the idea of a revolution where the roles were changing.
 Choice c) discusses the inefficiency of scientific management, but this does not directly relate to the argument about the changing roles of ownership and management.
 Choice d) suggests a conspiracy theory about managers overthrowing business owners, which is not supported by the argument in the paper.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Marxist feminists explain patriarchy in terms of: Choices: a) a lack of equal rights and opportunities for men and women b) sex classes,  through which men oppress women economically,  politically and sexually c) women's domestic labour being exploited by the capitalist economy d) the dual systems of capitalism and male domination 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the perspective of Marxist feminists.  Marxist feminists argue that patriarchy is not just about inequality between men and women,  but also about the exploitation of women's labor in the domestic sphere and the ways in which this is linked to the broader systems of capitalism and male domination.
 Next,  I need to consider each of the choices in the context of this perspective.  Choice a) focuses on the lack of equal rights and opportunities,  which is a part of the broader issue but does not capture the specific focus on the domestic labor of women and its links to capitalism and male domination.
 Choice b) mentions sex classes and men's economic,  political,  and sexual oppression of women,  which is related to the perspective but does not fully encompass the role of capitalism and the exploitation of women's domestic labor.
 Choice c) directly addresses the exploitation of women's domestic labor by the capitalist economy,  which is a key aspect of the Marxist feminist perspective.
 Choice d) combines the exploitation of women's domestic labor with the dual systems of capitalism and male domination,  which fully captures the perspective of Marxist feminists.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to identify which of the choices was not defined by Giddens (1998) as part of New Labour's 'third way'.
 According to Giddens (1998),  the 'third way' includes the democratization of civil society,  not the democratization of the family.  So,  choice a) is not part of Giddens' definition of the 'third way'.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Anti-psychiatrists like Laing & Esterson believed that: Choices: a) Psychiatry was an out-moded form of treatment and should be replaced by alternative therapies like aromatherapy and kinesiology b) Mental illnesses were biological in origin,  so there was no point in studying 'the mind' as experienced by the patient c) Psychiatrists were agents of capitalism who tried to instill ruling class ideology into their patients d) Behaviour that seemed bizarre could be seen as a reasonable response to disturbed patterns of family interaction 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the perspective of anti-psychiatrists like Laing & Esterson.  They were critical of the traditional psychiatric approach,  which focused on the individual's mind and the use of drugs.
 Next,  I need to compare the given choices with the perspective of anti-psychiatrists.  Choice a) suggests that psychiatry should be replaced by alternative therapies, which aligns with the anti-psychiatrists' criticism of the traditional approach.
 Choice b) states that mental illnesses are biological in origin, which is not the perspective of anti-psychiatrists, who believed that mental health issues were more related to social and environmental factors.
 Choice c) accuses psychiatrists of promoting capitalist ideology, which is a part of the anti-psychiatrists' critique, but it is not the central focus of their argument.
 Choice d) suggests that bizarre behavior can be a reasonable response to disturbed family patterns, which is related to the anti-psychiatrists' idea of 'double-bind' situations that can lead to mental health issues.
 After analyzing the choices,  I can conclude that the perspective of anti-psychiatrists like Laing & Esterson is best represented by choice d) {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Butler & Stokes (1969 ) suggested that working class support for the Labour Party arose from: Choices: a) socialization into working class families and communities b) rational calculation of self-interest c) issue-based concerns about culture and lifestyle d) false consciousness and the acceptance of hegemonic values 
 Output:
 First,  I need to recall the main idea of Butler & Stokes (1969).  They argued that working-class support for the Labour Party was not solely based on rational calculation of self-interest or issue-based concerns,  but also on socialization into working-class families and communities.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: In contemporary societies,  social institutions are: Choices: a) highly specialized,  interrelated sets of social practices b) disorganized social relations in a postmodern world c) virtual communities in cyberspace d) no longer relevant to sociology

 First,  I need to understand the nature of social institutions in contemporary societies.  Social institutions are defined as systems of shared practices,  norms,  and roles that are organized to meet the needs of society.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  a) highly specialized, interrelated sets of social practices - This choice aligns with the definition of social institutions as organized systems.  b) disorganized social relations in a postmodern world - This choice contradicts the definition of social institutions as organized systems.  c) virtual communities in cyberspace - This choice refers to a specific type of social interaction,  not the broader concept of social institutions.  d) no longer relevant to sociology - This choice is not relevant to the definition of social institutions.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: The term 'emotion work' (Hochschild 1983 ) refers to: Choices: a) the techniques used to consciously manage and present emotions that are deemed appropriate for public settings of interaction b) the work done by psychologists,  counselors and therapists to help clients with mental and emotional problems c) experiences such as grieving and falling in love,  which demand a lot of emotional energy from a person d) the way in which increasing levels of risk and anxiety have made us think more reflexively about our self-identities 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the definition of 'emotion work' as given by Hochschild (1983).  Emotion work,  according to Hochschild,  refers to the effort individuals make to manage and present emotions that are considered appropriate for different social contexts.
 Next,  I need to compare this definition to the given choices.  Choice a) describes the conscious management and presentation of emotions in public settings, which aligns with the definition of emotion work provided by Hochschild.
 Choice b) refers to the work of psychologists and therapists, which is not specifically related to emotion work as defined by Hochschild.
 Choice c) describes experiences that demand emotional energy, which is not the same as managing and presenting emotions in different social contexts.
 Choice d) discusses the impact of risk and anxiety on self-identities, which is not directly related to emotion work as defined by Hochschild.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to recall the four ideal types of social action that Max Weber identified.  Weber classified social action into four types based on the type of justification or purpose behind the action.
 The first type is instrumentally-rational,  which is based on means-ends rationality and efficiency.
 The second type is value-rational,  which is based on the pursuit of values and principles.
 The third type is traditional,  which is based on adherence to established customs and traditions.
 The fourth type is a) affectual,  which is based on emotional and interpersonal relationships.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the meaning of the term 'ecclesia'.  An ecclesia refers to a congregation or assembly of people who come together for a common purpose,  such as religious or political matters.
 Next,  I need to consider each choice and see if it matches the definition of 'ecclesia'.
 a) A religious organization that claims total spiritual authority over its members - This choice describes a specific type of religious group,  but it does not define 'ecclesia'.
 b) A church organized around voluntary rather than compulsory membership - This choice describes a specific type of church,  but it does not define 'ecclesia'.
 c) A sect or cult with a very small following - This choice describes a specific type of religious group,  but it does not define 'ecclesia'.
 d) A hierarchy of priests or other spiritual leaders - This choice describes a specific type of religious organization,  but it does not define 'ecclesia'.

None of the choices directly define 'ecclesia',  but they all describe different types of religious organizations.  However,  the original definition of 'ecclesia' is a congregation or assembly of people,  which is closest to the concept of a church organized around voluntary rather than compulsory membership.
Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

"Input: Sutherland's study of the 'professional thief' suggested that: Choices: a) people are socialized into a life of crime by associating with others who define it in positive terms b) the majority of crime is committed by middle class people in professional occupations c) those who were arrested and charged with theft did not define themselves as thieves d) the most dangerous criminals on the street were those who were highly skilled thieves 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the context of Sutherland's study. He focused on the 'professional thief' and aimed to understand their motivations and socialization.

Next, let's analyze each choice in relation to the study's findings:
a) This choice suggests that people are influenced by positive associations with crime, which aligns with Sutherland's concept of differential association theory, where individuals learn criminal behavior through social interactions.
b) This choice implies that middle-class professionals commit the majority of crimes, which is not supported by Sutherland's study, which focused on the 'professional thief' and did not generalize to the broader population.
c) This choice states that arrested thieves do not define themselves as thieves, which contradicts Sutherland's observation that the 'professional thief' often identifies as such within their social circles.
d) This choice claims that highly skilled thieves are the most dangerous, which is not directly supported by Sutherland's study, which focused on the motivations and socialization of professional thieves rather than their level of danger.

Based on the analysis, the choice that best aligns with Sutherland's study is a) people are socialized into a life of crime by associating with others who define it in positive terms.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

"Input: Stone's research suggests that prior to industrialization,  the nuclear family: Choices: a) did not exist in any form b) had begun to disappear,  as extended networks of kin became more important c) had begun to emerge through the separation of work and home life d) was simply another institution of patriarchal control 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of Stone's research.  Stone's research likely refers to the work of family historian Marjorie Stone, who studied the history of the nuclear family.
 Next,  I need to consider the time period mentioned,  which is before industrialization.  Before industrialization,  the economy was primarily agrarian,  and work and home life were more closely integrated.
 Finally,  I need to evaluate the choices based on this context.  Choice a) does not fit the context,  as the nuclear family did exist,  even if it was not as prevalent as it is today.  Choice b) also does not fit,  as extended networks of kin were more important,  not less.  Choice c) fits the context,  as the separation of work and home life began to emerge as a result of changes in the economy and society.  Choice d) is not directly supported by the context,  as the focus is on the integration of work and home life,  not the patriarchal control of the nuclear family.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 First, let's consider the context of the question. The question is about the theory of Pierre Bourdieu, a prominent sociologist known for his work on social class and cultural reproduction.

Next, let's examine the choices provided:
a) cults of the capital - This option seems to refer to the religious or ideological aspects of capitalism, which is not the primary focus of Bourdieu's theory.
b) capital culture - This could refer to the cultural aspects influenced by economic power, which is related to Bourdieu's concept of ""cultural capital.""
c) cultural capital - This term is directly related to Bourdieu's theory, which posits that cultural assets such as education, art, and manners contribute to the reproduction of social classes.

"Input: The general fertility rate fell between 1964  and 2000  because of: Choices: a) increases in the age of marriage and the age at which childbearing begins b) there being fewer women of childbearing age than there were in the first half of the century c) errors in the measurement of birth rates and production of statistics d) the risk of diseases caused by poverty,  poor housing and bad sanitation 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the time frame given,  which is from 1964  to 2000.  During this period,  there were significant changes in societal norms,  economy,  and living conditions.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice in the context of this time frame.
 a) Increases in the age of marriage and the age at which childbearing begins: This choice could be a factor,  as changes in societal norms and economic factors may have led to later marriages and childbearing.
 b) There being fewer women of childbearing age than there were in the first half of the century: This choice could also be a factor,  as the demographic structure of the population may have changed over time.
 c) Errors in the measurement of birth rates and production of statistics: While errors in measurement could affect the reported fertility rates,  this choice does not explain the underlying cause of the decline.
 d) The risk of diseases caused by poverty,  poor housing,  and bad sanitation: This choice could be a factor,  as improvements in public health and living conditions may have led to a decrease in the risk of diseases that could affect fertility.

After evaluating each choice,  I can conclude that the most likely explanation for the decline in the general fertility rate between 1964  and 2000  is a combination of factors,  including increases in the age of marriage and the age at which childbearing begins (a) and there being fewer women of childbearing age than there were in the first half of the century (b).

"Input: Howard's idea of the garden city consisted of: Choices: a) six small towns surrounded by green belts and linked to a larger central city b) planning cities to have plenty of trees,  flowers and public gardens c) each privately owned house to have its own front and back garden d) tower blocks to displace the population vertically and leave most of the land available as green open spaces 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the main idea of Howard's garden city concept.  Howard envisioned a sustainable and self-sufficient urban development model.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice based on the main idea.
 a) Six small towns surrounded by green belts and linked to a larger central city - This choice reflects the idea of decentralized living with green spaces and accessibility to a larger urban center, which aligns with Howard's vision.
 b) Planning cities to have plenty of trees,  flowers, and public gardens - This choice focuses on the importance of green spaces, which is a part of Howard's concept but does not encompass the whole idea.
 c) Each privately owned house to have its own front and back garden - This choice emphasizes individual garden ownership, which is not the central focus of Howard's garden city concept.
 d) Tower blocks to displace the population vertically and leave most of the land available as green open spaces - This choice focuses on vertical living and leaving land for green spaces, but it contradicts Howard's idea of decentralized living.

Based on the evaluation, the choice that best represents Howard's idea of the garden city is {'sol': 'a'}"

 First,  I need to identify the stages of the life course.  The life course is typically divided into several stages,  including infancy,  early childhood,  middle childhood,  adolescence,  early adulthood,  middle adulthood,  and late adulthood.
 Next,  I need to understand the 'third age'.  The 'third age' is a term used to describe the period between retirement and old age,  which is typically associated with middle adulthood.
 Now,  I can evaluate the choices based on the characteristics of the 'third age'.  a) active non-work and independence after retirement describes a period after retirement,  which is part of the 'third age'.  b) full time employment,  family-building and adult responsibility describes the period before retirement,  not the 'third age'.  c) illness,  isolation and increasing dependence on others is a possible characteristic of the 'third age' for some individuals,  but it is not the defining characteristic.  d) the transition from education to work,  and distinctive youth cultures describes the period of adolescence and early adulthood,  not the 'third age'.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Weber (1919 ) said that the state's monopoly of the use of force was legitimated by: Choices: a) charismatic authority b) rational-legal authority c) traditional authority d) value-rational authority 
 Output:
 First,  I need to recall the concept of Weber's ideal types of authority.  Max Weber distinguished between three types of authority: charismatic authority,  rational-legal authority,  and traditional authority.
 Next,  I need to consider the specific context of Weber's statement from 1919.  Weber argued that the state's monopoly of the use of force is legitimated by rational-legal authority.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Sullivan's (2000 ) study suggested that the proportion of housework men did was greatest when: Choices: a) they had rediscovered themselves as 'new men' b) their wives were at home and nagged them all the time c) exciting gadgets like the hoover and electric iron were invented d) they were unemployed or both partners worked full time 
 Output:
 First, we need to recall the context of Sullivan's (2000) study. The study focused on the relationship between men's participation in housework and various factors.

Next, we need to consider each choice and evaluate its relevance to the study's findings.

a) They had rediscovered themselves as 'new men': This choice refers to a shift in men's attitudes and roles, which could potentially increase their participation in housework.

b) Their wives were at home and nagged them all the time: This choice suggests that men would do more housework if their wives were constantly demanding it, which might not necessarily lead to a long-term increase in participation.

c) Exciting gadgets like the hoover and electric iron were invented: While the invention of these gadgets could have made housework easier and potentially encouraged men to participate more, the study's focus was on the reasons behind men's participation, not the tools available.

d) They were unemployed or both partners worked full time: This choice suggests that men's participation in housework was greatest when they were not working or when both partners were working full time. This could imply that when men are not working, they have more time to participate in housework, and when both partners work, the division of labor is more equal.

Based on the analysis, the choice that best aligns with Sullivan's (2000) study's findings is d) they were unemployed or both partners worked full time.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The shift from custodial to joint parenthood after divorce means that: Choices: a) fathers are more likely to be absent from their children's lives b) one parent has total responsibility for the child's welfare and socialization c) both parents are expected to co-operate in the continued care of their children d) parents must provide for all of their children in equal measure 
 Output:
 First,  let's consider the shift from custodial to joint parenthood after divorce.  This means that both parents share the responsibility for their children.
 Next,  we can eliminate choices that contradict this idea.  Choice a) suggests that fathers are more likely to be absent,  which contradicts the idea of joint parenthood.  Choice b) suggests that one parent has total responsibility,  which also contradicts the idea of joint parenthood.  Choice d) suggests that parents must provide for their children in equal measure,  which is not necessarily true,  as each parent may contribute differently based on their circumstances.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Émile Durkheim believed the primary focus of sociology should be which of the following?  Choices: a) Social action b) Social facts c) Class relations d) Cultural dynamics 
 Output:
 First,  I need to recall the main contributions of Émile Durkheim to sociology.  He was a founding father of sociology and focused on the study of social facts, which are the norms, values, and institutions that shape human behavior and society.
 Next,  I need to compare this to the given choices.  a) Social action refers to the ways in which individuals interact with each other, which is not the primary focus of Durkheim's sociology.  b) Social facts align with Durkheim's emphasis on the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals.  c) Class relations are a specific aspect of social structure that Durkheim studied, but it is not his primary focus.  d) Cultural dynamics refers to the study of how cultural norms and values change over time, which is related to Durkheim's work but not his primary focus.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to recall the main finding of the Brown & Harris (1978) study on depression.  The study found that women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: The alternative form of 'network organization' means that: Choices: a) work can be subcontracted out to independent suppliers and retailers b) business transactions occur only through electronic communication c) the Japanese model is applied,  through lateral networks of flexible roles d) activities are redistributed equally between men and women 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the term 'network organization'.  A network organization is a type of organization that relies on a network of independent suppliers,  retailers,  and other partners to operate.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice based on this understanding.  Choice a) describes a situation where work is subcontracted out to independent suppliers and retailers,  which is consistent with the concept of a network organization.
 Choice b) describes business transactions occurring only through electronic communication,  which is not necessarily related to the alternative form of network organization.
 Choice c) describes the application of the Japanese model,  which is not directly related to the alternative form of network organization.
 Choice d) describes activities being redistributed equally between men and women,  which is not related to the alternative form of network organization.

"Input: Margaret Mead suggested that: Choices: a) adolescence and gender roles varied between societies and so were culturally determined b) gender roles in three New Guinea societies were identical and so must be biologically determined c) adolescence in the USA is a time of relative calm compared to the experience in Japan and Europe d) anthropological fieldwork can be problematic because the researcher's values affect the way they interpret their observations 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the main idea of Margaret Mead's suggestion.  Mead was an anthropologist who studied gender roles and adolescence in different cultures.
 Next,  I need to look at the choices and find the one that aligns with Mead's main idea.  Mead believed that culture played a significant role in shaping gender roles and adolescence experiences.

"Input: The term 'secondary deviation' refers to: Choices: a) the punishment or stigmatization of deviant acts b) the labelling of an act as deviant through social reactions to it c) the ways in which taking on a deviant role affects future action d) all of the above 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the term 'secondary deviation.'  This term refers to the process by which an individual who has taken on a deviant role is further stigmatized and labeled as deviant due to the reactions of others to their behavior.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  Choice a) describes the punishment or stigmatization of deviant acts, which is part of the process of secondary deviation.  Choice b) describes the labelling of an act as deviant through social reactions to it, which is also part of the process of secondary deviation.  Choice c) describes the ways in which taking on a deviant role affects future action, which is related to but not the same as the process of secondary deviation.
 Finally,  I need to determine which choice best represents the term 'secondary deviation.'  Choice d) states that all of the above choices are correct, which is not accurate because choice c) is related to but not the same as the process of secondary deviation.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The effect of the Internet upon the public sphere has been to: Choices: a) repress it,  by promoting only the interests of elite groups b) revive it,  by reaffirming a commitment to freedom of speech c) reproduce it,  by emphasizing face-to-face contact with peer groups d) replace it with a superior form of communication 
 Output:
 First,  we need to consider the impact of the Internet on the public sphere.  The Internet has made it easier for people to share information and ideas,  and to participate in public discourse.
 Next,  we need to evaluate each choice in light of this impact.  Choice a) suggests that the Internet has repressed the public sphere,  but this does not align with the fact that it has made it easier for people to participate.
 Choice b) suggests that the Internet has revived the public sphere,  by reaffirming a commitment to freedom of speech.  This is a plausible interpretation,  as the Internet has made it easier for people to share their opinions and engage in public discourse.
 Choice c) suggests that the Internet has reproduced the public sphere,  by emphasizing face-to-face contact with peer groups.  This does not seem to align with the impact of the Internet,  which has facilitated online communication rather than emphasizing face-to-face contact.
 Choice d) suggests that the Internet has replaced the public sphere with a superior form of communication.  This is a subjective evaluation,  and not necessarily supported by the evidence.

Based on the analysis,  the most plausible answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Weber said that the 'spirit of capitalism' could be traced back to: Choices: a) the movement towards religious pluralism b) inspirational Protestant groups who revived religious ideas c) new religious movements who rejected traditional forms of labour d) Calvinists who engaged in ascetic practices to gain signs of salvation 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the context of Weber's statement.  Max Weber was a sociologist who studied the development of capitalism and its relationship with religion.
 Next,  we need to consider each choice and evaluate its relevance to Weber's ideas.  a) the movement towards religious pluralism is not directly related to the development of capitalism as described by Weber.  b) inspirational Protestant groups who revived religious ideas could be relevant,  as Weber did discuss how certain Protestant beliefs contributed to the development of capitalism.  c) new religious movements who rejected traditional forms of labour is not mentioned by Weber as a factor in the development of capitalism.  d) Calvinists who engaged in ascetic practices to gain signs of salvation is also relevant,  as Weber discussed how Calvinism played a role in the development of capitalism.
 Finally,  we need to choose the option that best aligns with Weber's ideas on the 'spirit of capitalism'.  Both b) and d) are relevant to Weber's analysis,  but d) specifically addresses the economic implications of religious practices,  which is central to Weber's argument.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The terms 'crisis of the 1970 s' is used to refer to: Choices: a) declining profits and rising unemployment b) the eradication of the welfare state c) rising divorce rates and the decline of the traditional family d) an unfortunate twist in fashion sensibility 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the 'crisis of the 1970s'.  The 1970s was a period marked by economic challenges,  particularly in developed countries.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice in relation to the historical context of the 1970s.  a) declining profits and rising unemployment is a common description of economic downturns,  which occurred during this period.  b) the eradication of the welfare state is not accurate,  as many countries expanded their welfare systems during the 1970s.  c) rising divorce rates and the decline of the traditional family is a social issue,  but not a primary economic crisis.  d) an unfortunate twist in fashion sensibility is not relevant to the economic context of the 1970s.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: The Macpherson Report highlighted the increasing problem of: Choices: a) hate crimes: violence against ethnic minorities simply because of their race b) institutional racism: systematic forms of disadvantage built into the routines and practices of social institutions c) overt racism in the police force that must be tackled by institutional reforms d) growing numbers of asylum seekers in need of long term accommodation 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the topic that the Macpherson Report focused on.  The Macpherson Report,  commissioned by the British government in 1981,  was named after Sir William Macpherson and was tasked with investigating the murder of Stephen Lawrence.
 The report,  published in 1999,  highlighted the problem of institutional racism.  Institutional racism refers to systematic forms of disadvantage built into the routines and practices of social institutions,  which can lead to discriminatory outcomes against ethnic minorities.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Seven people standing silently while waiting for a bus at a bus stop is an example of which of the following?  Choices: a) A primary group b) A secondary group c) An aggregate d) A social category 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the question.  The scenario describes seven people waiting together at a bus stop,  and they are not interacting with each other.
 Next,  I need to consider the definitions of the choices.  A primary group is a close-knit group with strong emotional bonds,  a secondary group is a more formal or impersonal group,  an aggregate is a collection of individuals without any particular relationship,  and a social category is a group defined by shared characteristics.
 Now,  I can analyze the situation.  The seven people are standing together at a bus stop,  but they are not interacting,  so there are no strong emotional bonds.  They are not part of a formal or impersonal group,  and they are not defined by any shared characteristics.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider each choice and see if it aligns with the definition of being global in the sense of environmentalist social movements.
 a) They increase our awareness of risks that affect the whole planet. This choice suggests that these movements focus on global issues, which is consistent with the idea of being global.
 b) They appeal to universal values and human rights. This choice suggests that these movements have a universal appeal, which is also consistent with the idea of being global.
 c) They use global media to generate publicity. This choice suggests that these movements have a global reach, which is consistent with the idea of being global.
 d) All of the above. Since all the previous choices are consistent with the idea of being global, this choice is also consistent.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Chodorow (1978 ) argued that gender socialization occurred through: Choices: a) both boys and girls being closely attached to their mothers,  but then boys breaking away b) girls being attached to their mothers but then breaking away c) boys being attached to their fathers and girls to their mothers d) both boys and girls being closely attached to their fathers,  but girls breaking away 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the argument presented by Chodorow (1978).  Chodorow argued that gender socialization occurs through the process of children,  both boys and girls,  being closely attached to their mothers but then breaking away from this attachment as they internalize gender roles.

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the context of the 1980s.  During this decade,  societal norms and attitudes towards masculinity were changing.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice in the context of the 1980s.  Option a) sensitive,  caring,  and emotional aligns with the broader societal shift towards valuing emotional expression and relationships.
 Option b) laddish,  aggressive,  and violent does not align with the changing norms of the 1980s,  as these traits were not considered desirable or masculine.
 Option c) a strong and dependable breadwinner is a characteristic that was still valued during the 1980s,  but it does not capture the changing attitudes towards masculinity.
 Option d) openly bisexual and proud of it is not consistent with the context of the 1980s,  as while bisexuality was becoming more accepted, being openly bisexual and proud of it was not the prevailing attitude.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: In the 1960 s,  comprehensive schools did not eradicate class inequalities in education because: Choices: a) they tended to recruit pupils from the inner cities and traditionally working class areas b) selective schools could still 'cream off' the most able pupils,  while the comprehensives put children into ability streams c) teachers in comprehensive schools used the restricted code in the classroom,  whereas working class pupils used elaborated codes of speech d) national testing and league tables made the new schools highly competitive and selective 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the context of the 1960 s and the purpose of comprehensive schools.  Comprehensive schools were established to provide education to all children,  irrespective of their academic ability,  and to eliminate the class inequalities that existed in the selective system.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice in the context of the comprehensive school system and its impact on class inequalities.
 a) Comprehensive schools did indeed recruit pupils from the inner cities and traditionally working-class areas,  but this choice does not explain why they did not eradicate class inequalities.
 b) Selective schools could still 'cream off' the most able pupils,  which means that the best students would still attend these schools,  leaving the comprehensive schools with a less able student body.  This choice suggests that the comprehensive schools did not achieve their goal of providing equal education to all children.
 c) The use of restricted and elaborated codes of speech in comprehensive schools does not directly relate to the eradication of class inequalities in education.
 d) National testing and league tables created a competitive and selective environment in the new comprehensive schools,  which contradicts the purpose of comprehensive education.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: In idealized views of science,  the experimental method is said to involve: Choices: a) testing out new research methods to see which one works best b) isolating and measuring the effect of one variable upon another c) using personal beliefs and values to decide what to study d) interpreting data subjectively,  drawing on theoretical paradigms 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key aspect of the experimental method in the context of idealized views of science.  The experimental method is a systematic approach to testing hypotheses and theories.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice in relation to this key aspect.  Choice a) focuses on testing new research methods,  which is related to the experimental method but not its core aspect.  Choice b) involves isolating and measuring the effect of one variable upon another,  which is a common component of the experimental method.  Choice c) suggests using personal beliefs and values,  which is not aligned with the objective nature of the experimental method.  Choice d) refers to interpreting data subjectively,  which contradicts the objective nature of the experimental method.
 Based on this analysis,  the choice that best represents the core aspect of the experimental method in idealized views of science is {'sol': 'b'}"

 First,  I need to understand the definition of an 'open' society.  An 'open' society is one that is transparent,  inclusive,  and accessible to all its members.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice based on this definition.  Choice a) grants every member equal status,  which aligns with the idea of transparency and inclusiveness.  Choice b) does not have any official secrets in its government,  which aligns with the idea of transparency.  Choice c) has permissive attitudes towards sexual behaviour,  which does not necessarily align with the definition of an 'open' society.  Choice d) allows people to move between levels of the hierarchy,  which aligns with the idea of inclusiveness.

"Input: The Nation of Islam group appealed to: Choices: a) British-born second generation immigrants from the Asian subcontinent b) White Americans who wanted to convert to Islam c) African-Americans who felt excluded from the 'ethnic melting pot' in the USA d) African-Caribbeans who lived in the inner cities and had a distinctive youth culture 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify which group the Nation of Islam group appealed to.  The Nation of Islam is known for its focus on Black nationalism and Islamic identity.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice in relation to the characteristics of the Nation of Islam.
 a) British-born second generation immigrants from the Asian subcontinent - This choice does not match the focus on Black nationalism and Islamic identity.
 b) White Americans who wanted to convert to Islam - This choice also does not match the focus on Black nationalism and Islamic identity.
 c) African-Americans who felt excluded from the 'ethnic melting pot' in the USA - This choice aligns with the focus on Black nationalism and Islamic identity, as it mentions African-Americans and their exclusion from the 'ethnic melting pot.'
 d) African-Caribbeans who lived in the inner cities and had a distinctive youth culture - This choice does not specifically mention Islam or Black nationalism.

Based on the analysis,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Comte's term 'positivism' refers to: Choices: a) a theory that emphasizes the positive aspects of society b) the precise,  scientific study of observable phenomena c) a theory that posits difficult questions and sets out to answer them d) an unscientific set of laws about social progress 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the meaning of 'positivism'.  Positivism is a philosophical movement that emphasizes the importance of empirical evidence and the use of scientific methods in acquiring knowledge.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice in the context of this definition.  Choice a) suggests that positivism focuses on the positive aspects of society,  which is not accurate because positivism is concerned with the scientific study of phenomena,  not their value.
 Choice b) states that positivism is the precise,  scientific study of observable phenomena,  which aligns with the definition of positivism.
 Choice c) suggests that positivism involves posing difficult questions and answering them,  which is not the focus of positivism.
 Choice d) claims that positivism is an unscientific set of laws about social progress,  which is incorrect because positivism is based on scientific methods.

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of racialized discourse.  Racialized discourse refers to the ways in which race is discussed and perceived in society.
 Next,  I need to consider each of the choices and evaluate their relevance to the concept of racialized discourse.  Choice a suggests that race is an objective way of categorizing people on biological grounds,  which does not align with the idea that race is socially constructed.
 Choice b states that the idea of race is socially constructed through powerful ideologies,  which is consistent with the concept of racialized discourse.
 Choice c mentions race relations in Britain and America and colonial times,  which is related to the historical context of race but does not directly address the concept of racialized discourse.
 Choice d suggests that people choose their racial identity and this becomes fixed,  which does not align with the idea that race is socially constructed.

"Input: A major car accident occurs.  One man stops his car and starts helping people.  After seeing him stop,  others also stop and start helping.  Which of the following theories best explains the scenario?  Choices: a) Convergence b) Emergent-norm c) Contagion d) Value-added 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the scenario.  A major car accident occurs,  and one man stops his car to help people.  Others also stop and help after seeing his action.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices and their definitions.
 a) Convergence: refers to the process where different groups or individuals come together.
 b) Emergent-norm: refers to the process where a new social norm emerges due to the actions of individuals.
 c) Contagion: refers to the process where a behavior spreads from one person to another, like a contagious disease.
 d) Value-added: refers to the process where an action adds value to a situation.

 In this scenario,  the man's action of stopping to help starts a chain reaction where others also stop to help.  The behavior spreads from one person to another.

"Input: A new highway extends from a major city though an area used for farmland.  Which of the following is most likely to happen as a result?  Choices: a) Farmers will increase the acreage under production.  b) The city will evolve into a multiple nuclei model.  c) Suburbanization will develop because the time it takes to commute to the city has been decreased.  d) People from the countryside will move to the city,  depopulating the farmland region.  
 Output:
 First,  consider the impact of the new highway on the accessibility of the major city.  The highway will likely reduce the time it takes to commute to the city,  making it more convenient for people to travel to and from the city.
 Next,  consider the potential changes in land use and population distribution.  With the reduced commute time,  people from the surrounding areas,  including the farmland region,  may be more inclined to move to the city or to nearby suburbs.
 Finally,  consider the implications for farmers.  As people move to the city,  there may be a decrease in the number of people available to work the farmland,  potentially leading to a reduction in acreage under production.
 Therefore,  the most likely outcome is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: According to W.  E.  B.  Dubois,  progress for African Americans in the aftermath of slavery Choices: a) depended on the small group of African Americans receiving the same thorough and extensive education as the most talented White Americans were able to access b) involved their use of skills they already had from farming,  domestic work,  and labors of rural life rather than being forced to learn new skills in the late 1800 s c) required that they be trained and prepared as craftspeople and service employees so they could become immediately self-sufficient d) required them to move to large cities where they would be accepted as equals in government,  religion,  and education 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the question,  which is about the progress of African Americans after slavery.  The choices given are about different ways they could achieve progress.
 Next,  I need to consider the historical context of the time period mentioned,  the late 1800 s.  During this time,  African Americans were facing challenges in accessing education and were often forced to work in low-paying jobs.
 Now,  I need to evaluate each choice based on this context.  Choice a) suggests that progress depended on a small group receiving the same education as white Americans,  which is not realistic for most African Americans during this time.  Choice b) mentions using existing skills,  which could be a more practical approach for many African Americans.  Choice c) suggests being trained as craftspeople and service employees,  which could also be a practical approach.  Choice d) suggests moving to large cities,  which was not a realistic option for everyone due to lack of resources.
 Therefore,  considering the historical context and the practicality of each choice,  the most likely answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Pluralist theories suggest that: Choices: a) the state's power can be exercised through several different administrative structures b) the ruling elite is composed of people from various class backgrounds c) political parties must compete for the votes of 'consumers' in the electorate d) there is a close alignment between class background and party preference 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the definition of pluralist theories. Pluralist theories in political science suggest that power in society is distributed among various groups or interests, rather than being concentrated in the hands of a few.

Next, let's evaluate each choice in the context of pluralist theories:
a) the state's power can be exercised through several different administrative structures - This choice aligns with the idea that power is distributed among different administrative structures, which is consistent with pluralist theory.
b) the ruling elite is composed of people from various class backgrounds - This choice suggests that the ruling elite is diverse, which could be consistent with a pluralist theory that emphasizes the distribution of power among different groups.
c) political parties must compete for the votes of 'consumers' in the electorate - This choice suggests competition among political parties, which is a key aspect of pluralist theory.
d) there is a close alignment between class background and party preference - This choice suggests a correlation between class background and party preference, which is more aligned with a Marxist perspective of class conflict rather than pluralist theory.

Based on the analysis, the choice that best aligns with pluralist theories is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: The term 'over-urbanization' means that: Choices: a) life in modern Western cities is so far removed from that of the Third World that we find it difficult to understand these societies b) in poorer countries,  the rapidly developing cities drain resources from the rural areas c) the extent to which urbanization affects development has been exaggerated d) governments are so preoccupied with urbanization in the West that they forget to attend to problems in the Third World 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the meaning of 'over-urbanization'.  The term refers to the excessive growth of cities and the negative impacts it can have on development.
 Next,  I need to consider each choice and see which one best describes 'over-urbanization'.
 a) This choice talks about the difference between modern Western cities and the Third World, but it does not address the concept of over-urbanization.
 b) This choice mentions that rapidly developing cities drain resources from rural areas, which is a negative impact of over-urbanization.
 c) This choice suggests that the impact of urbanization on development has been exaggerated, which is not the definition of over-urbanization.
 d) This choice talks about governments being preoccupied with urbanization in the West, but it does not address the concept of over-urbanization.

After analyzing each choice,  I can conclude that the best definition of 'over-urbanization' is b) in poorer countries,  the rapidly developing cities drain resources from the rural areas.

"Input: The capitalist class of the mid-twentieth century were said to join the upper class because they: Choices: a) participated in the same leisure pursuits and events of the 'social calendar' b) emulated the lifestyle and cultural values of the traditional aristocracy c) owned companies and financial assets that generated wealth through corporations d) had direct,  personal ownerships of land and businesses as physical assets 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the context of the question.  The question is about the capitalist class in the mid-twentieth century and how they joined the upper class.
 Next,  we need to analyze each choice and see which one fits the context.
 a) Participating in the same leisure pursuits and events of the 'social calendar' could be a way for the capitalist class to join the upper class,  as it would allow them to be part of the same social circles and networks.
 b) Emulating the lifestyle and cultural values of the traditional aristocracy could also be a way for the capitalist class to join the upper class,  as it would show a connection to the established upper class.
 c) Owning companies and financial assets that generated wealth through corporations is a characteristic of the capitalist class,  but it doesn't necessarily explain how they joined the upper class.
 d) Having direct,  personal ownerships of land and businesses as physical assets is another characteristic of the capitalist class,  but it also doesn't necessarily explain how they joined the upper class.

Based on the analysis,  the choice that best explains how the capitalist class joined the upper class is {'sol': 'a'}"

 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  Choice a) refers to intra-personal mobility,  not inter-generational mobility.  Choice c) and d) do not mention the concept of different generations.
 The only choice that refers to mobility between different generations is b) movement into different occupational categories between generations.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: The term 'culture industry',  used by members of the Frankfurt School,  referred to: Choices: a) the globalization of culture through new technologies b) the way in which cultural products were bought and sold for profit c) the development of subcultures and counter-cultures in society d) the way in which industrialization had created new means of communication 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the term 'culture industry' as used by the Frankfurt School.  The Frankfurt School was a group of intellectuals who analyzed culture and society during the early 20th century.
 Next,  I need to consider each of the given choices and determine which one aligns with the concept of the culture industry as used by the Frankfurt School.
 Choice a) refers to the globalization of culture through new technologies, which is a broader concept that includes the culture industry but is not specific to the Frankfurt School's usage.
 Choice b) refers to the way in which cultural products were bought and sold for profit, which is a key aspect of the culture industry as used by the Frankfurt School.
 Choice c) refers to the development of subcultures and counter-cultures in society, which is related to but distinct from the culture industry concept.
 Choice d) refers to the way in which industrialization had created new means of communication, which is a broader concept that includes the culture industry but is not specific to the Frankfurt School's usage.

Based on the analysis,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: According to Hakim (1995,  1996 ),  the majority of part-time work is done by women because: Choices: a) part-time jobs pay relatively high wages and so are financially beneficial b) they make a rational choice to combine employment with their 'home-centred' lives c) their choices are constrained by structural factors,  such as being unable to afford childcare d) full time work is not available in the kinds of occupations that they want to enter 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the options given and evaluate their relevance to the statement provided by Hakim.
 Option a) suggests that part-time jobs pay relatively high wages,  which would make them financially beneficial.  However,  this does not necessarily explain why the majority of part-time work is done by women.
 Option b) suggests that women make a rational choice to combine employment with their 'home-centred' lives.  This option is related to the idea of women balancing work and family responsibilities,  which could be a factor in part-time work.
 Option c) suggests that women's choices are constrained by structural factors,  such as being unable to afford childcare.  This option directly addresses the issue of women's limited options due to financial constraints,  which could be a reason for part-time work.
 Option d) suggests that full-time work is not available in the kinds of occupations that women want to enter.  This option implies that women may be forced to work part-time due to limited job opportunities in their preferred fields.

Upon evaluating the options,  I find that option c) their choices are constrained by structural factors,  such as being unable to afford childcare,  best explains why the majority of part-time work is done by women according to Hakim.
Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A sect is organised around: Choices: a) beliefs that can be challenged by members,  a charismatic leader,  and openness to new recruits b) tolerance towards other religions and the separation of church and state c) voluntary membership,  democratic leadership,  and high levels of emotional commitment d) the idea of the secular world itself as being sacred 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a sect is.  A sect is a religious group that is considered separate from the main body of a religion due to differences in beliefs,  practices,  or both.
 Next,  I need to analyze the choices and find the one that best describes the characteristics of a sect.
 a) This choice mentions beliefs that can be challenged,  a charismatic leader,  and openness to new recruits.  These are all characteristics of a sect,  as sects often have more flexible beliefs and are more open to new members.
 b) This choice mentions tolerance towards other religions and the separation of church and state.  These are characteristics of a more liberal and secular religious group,  not a sect.
 c) This choice mentions voluntary membership,  democratic leadership,  and high levels of emotional commitment.  While sects may have these characteristics,  they are not unique to sects and can be found in other types of religious groups.
 d) This choice mentions the idea of the secular world itself as being sacred.  This is not a characteristic of a sect,  as sects often have specific beliefs that differ from the main body of a religion.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: What is the name of the process by which we acquire a sense of identity and become members of society?  Choices: a) rationalization b) colonization c) McDonaldization d) socialization 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the question and identify the process that leads to the formation of identity and social membership.  The process described is related to how individuals learn societal norms, values, and roles.
 Next,  I can eliminate options that do not fit the description.  Rationalization is a psychological defense mechanism, colonization is a historical event, and McDonaldization refers to the spread of fast-food culture.  None of these options describe the process of becoming a member of society.
 This leaves me with option d) socialization, which is the process by which individuals learn the norms, values, and roles of their society and become members.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Pre-testing a questionnaire is useful for: Choices: a) finding out which topics are important to the respondents b) testing out your computer and printer c) identifying any problems with the question wording and routing d) deciding which respondents to leave out of the final sample 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the purpose of pre-testing a questionnaire.  The main goal of pre-testing is to identify any issues with the questionnaire itself,  such as unclear questions or confusing routing.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice in relation to the purpose of pre-testing.  Choice a) is related to the content of the questionnaire,  not the actual testing process.  Choice b) is about technical aspects,  not the questionnaire's content or clarity.  Choice c) directly relates to the purpose of pre-testing,  as it involves identifying any problems with the question wording and routing.  Choice d) is about selecting respondents,  which is a separate step from pre-testing the questionnaire itself.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Judith Butler (1999 ) suggested that: Choices: a) sexual characteristics are the biological determinants of gender b) heterosexuality and homosexuality are essential,  opposing identities c) the 'two-sex' model replaced the 'one-sex' model in the eighteenth century d) gender is performed through bodily gestures and styles to create 'sex' 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key concept in Judith Butler's theory.  Butler is known for her work on gender performativity,  which suggests that gender is not a fixed attribute but is instead constructed through the performance of certain behaviors and actions.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice in relation to this concept.  a) suggests that sexual characteristics are the biological determinants of gender,  which does not align with Butler's theory of performativity.  b) describes opposing identities,  which is not the main focus of Butler's work.  c) discusses the 'two-sex' model replacing the 'one-sex' model,  which is related to the history of sexology but not the core of Butler's theory.  d) states that gender is performed through bodily gestures and styles to create 'sex,' which directly aligns with Butler's concept of gender performativity.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Patterns of drug use in Britain reveal that: Choices: a) it has increased and is no longer confined to a hedonistic youth subculture b) the most commonly used recreational drug is Ecstasy c) teenage girls are more likely to experiment with hard drugs than teenage boys d) despite a series of moral panics,  the use of illegal drugs is very rare 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze each choice and determine if it is supported by the given information.
 Choice a) states that drug use has increased and is no longer confined to a hedonistic youth subculture.  This choice is supported by the information provided,  as it suggests a change in patterns of drug use.
 Choice b) claims that the most commonly used recreational drug is Ecstasy.  This choice is not directly supported by the information provided,  as it does not mention Ecstasy specifically.
 Choice c) suggests that teenage girls are more likely to experiment with hard drugs than teenage boys.  This choice is not directly supported by the information provided,  as it does not mention gender differences in drug use.
 Choice d) claims that the use of illegal drugs is very rare.  This choice is not supported by the information provided,  as it contradicts the idea that drug use has increased and is no longer confined to a specific subculture.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Murray thought that the 'underclass' consisted of people who: Choices: a) formed an inferior 'race' with low levels of intelligence b) lived morally unsound lives of crime and squalor c) were too reliant upon welfare benefits d) all of the above 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the definition of 'underclass.'  The underclass refers to a group of people who are excluded from the mainstream economy and society due to their inability to participate in it.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice in relation to the definition.  Choice a) suggests that the underclass is a specific 'race' with low intelligence, which is not accurate as it implies a genetic basis for exclusion, whereas the underclass is a social construct.
 Choice b) suggests that the underclass lives a life of crime and squalor, which is a stereotype but not the full definition.
 Choice c) suggests that the underclass is too reliant on welfare benefits, which is partially true but does not capture the full scope of the underclass.
 Choice d) suggests that all of the above are true, which is not accurate as choices a) and c) do not fully capture the definition of the underclass.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Religious organizations such as the Church of Norway,  Islam,  the Church of England,  and the Church of Greece have which of the following characteristics in common?  Choices: a) They are cultures as well as churches.  b) They practice separation of church and state.  c) They exclude women as clergy.  d) They are monotheistic.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze each characteristic and see if it applies to all the religious organizations mentioned.
 a) They are cultures as well as churches: While these organizations may have cultural aspects, they are primarily religious institutions.
 b) They practice separation of church and state: This characteristic is not common among all the mentioned religious organizations.
 c) They exclude women as clergy: This characteristic is not common among all the mentioned religious organizations.
 d) They are monotheistic: All the mentioned religious organizations (Church of Norway, Islam, Church of England, and Church of Greece) are monotheistic.

"Input: A researcher mailed 1,000  questionnaires to members of a labor union and received 300  back.  Most of those who returned the questionnaires indicated that they were dissatisfied with the union.  Results based only on the returned questionnaires are most likely contaminated by Choices: a) response rate bias b) researcher bias c) confusing correlation and causation d) statistical regression 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the potential bias in the data.  In this case,  the researcher mailed out 1,000  questionnaires and received only 300  back.  This indicates that not all respondents participated,  which could lead to a bias in the results.
 Next,  I need to consider the type of bias.  The issue here is that the returned questionnaires are not representative of the entire population of the labor union,  as those who did not return the questionnaire are not included in the analysis.
 Finally,  I compare the potential biases to the choices given.  The most likely bias in this scenario is related to the response rate,  as it affects the representativeness of the returned questionnaires.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Role-learning theory suggests that Choices: a) we internalise and take on social roles from a pre-existing framework b) we create and negotiate our roles through interaction with others c) social roles are not fixed or stable but fluid and pluralistic d) roles have to be learned to suppress unconscious motivations 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the role-learning theory's focus on how individuals acquire and understand their social roles. 

Step 1: Analyze the options.
a) This option suggests that individuals simply internalize and adopt pre-existing roles without much negotiation or creation.
b) This option implies that individuals actively create and negotiate their roles through interactions with others.
c) This option highlights that social roles are not fixed but rather fluid and can be pluralistic, meaning they can change and be varied.
d) This option suggests that learning roles is related to managing or suppressing unconscious motivations.

Step 2: Identify the core concept of role-learning theory.
Role-learning theory emphasizes the process through which individuals develop their social roles, which involves not just accepting pre-existing frameworks but actively engaging in the creation, negotiation, and understanding of these roles.

Step 3: Match the core concept with the most appropriate option.
Based on the core concept of role-learning theory, the process of creating and negotiating roles through interaction with others best represents the theory's perspective.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Post-modernist writers have argued that: Choices: a) we live in a world of superficial,  fragmented images b) no theory is better than any other: 'anything goes' c) society has changed and we need new kinds of theory d) all of the above 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the argument of post-modernist writers.  Post-modernist writers argue that traditional notions of truth,  reality,  and certainty are problematic.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice in relation to this argument.  a) they argue that we live in a world of superficial,  fragmented images,  which aligns with their critique of traditional notions of reality.  b) they argue that no theory is better than any other: 'anything goes',  which reflects their rejection of absolute truths and the idea that one theory is superior to another.  c) they argue that society has changed and we need new kinds of theory,  which shows their recognition of the changing nature of society and the need for new theoretical frameworks.
 Finally,  I will determine which choice best represents the argument of post-modernist writers.  All three choices (a, b, and c) are consistent with the argument of post-modernist writers.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Leroy visits his parents,  who live in a primarily African American working-class neighborhood.  During his visit,  he notices that the community is changing.  Several developments have been built to accommodate single-family homes,  and upscale shopping centers have been added.  While Leroy appreciates these changes,  he is worried that his parents will not be able to afford to continue living in their neighborhood because property values are rising.  Which of the following best explains what is happening to Leroy's old neighborhood?  Choices: a) Gentrification b) Urbanization c) White flight d) The demographic transition 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key elements of the situation.  The neighborhood is changing,  with new developments and rising property values.  Leroy is concerned about his parents' ability to afford to live there.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given and match them to the situation.  Gentrification is the process of a neighborhood changing from a lower-income, working-class area to a higher-income, often more diverse area, often accompanied by rising property values.
 Urbanization is the process of a population moving from rural areas to urban areas,  which is not the main focus of the situation.
 White flight is the phenomenon of white people moving out of urban areas to suburban or rural areas,  which does not fully capture the situation.
 The demographic transition is a model that describes the change in birth and death rates over time,  which is not relevant to the situation.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Warner's study of the city of Natchez in the American Deep South showed that the 'colour line' there was: Choices: a) no longer a powerful influence upon race relations b) a way of marking out the land so that black people had less space for housing c) a new policy that had been introduced to assimilate black and white groups d) a sharp division between black and white castes,  underpinned by beliefs about white superiority 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the context of Warner's study.  Warner was an American sociologist who conducted research in the American Deep South during the early 20th century.  His study focused on the 'colour line,' which refers to the social, economic, and political barriers that separate racial groups.
 Next,  we need to consider the choices given and evaluate them based on the context of Warner's study.  Choice a) suggests that the 'colour line' was no longer a powerful influence upon race relations, which is not consistent with the historical context of the American South during the early 20th century.
 Choice b) describes the 'colour line' as a way of marking out the land, which is not relevant to the social and racial context of Warner's study.
 Choice c) proposes that the 'colour line' was a new policy to assimilate black and white groups, which is not consistent with the historical context of racial segregation and discrimination in the American South.
 Choice d) describes the 'colour line' as a sharp division between black and white castes, underpinned by beliefs about white superiority, which is consistent with the historical context of racial segregation and discrimination in the American South during the early 20th century.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The social construction of childhood can be traced back to: Choices: a) the introduction of compulsory education b) increasingly emotional ties between parents and children c) new consumer goods for children,  such as clothes,  toys and books d) all of the above 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider each choice and evaluate its impact on the social construction of childhood.
 a) The introduction of compulsory education is a significant factor that contributed to the social construction of childhood.  It established a clear boundary between childhood and adulthood,  and it also created a sense of dependency on the state for education.
 b) Increasingly emotional ties between parents and children can also be considered a factor in the social construction of childhood.  However,  this choice does not directly contribute to the definition and role of childhood in society.
 c) The availability of new consumer goods for children,  such as clothes,  toys,  and books,  can be seen as a way to reinforce the social construction of childhood.  These goods are often marketed specifically to children,  and they help to create a distinct identity for children in society.
 d) Since both a) and c) are factors that contributed to the social construction of childhood,  this choice is also valid.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: In Marx's theory,  the 'mode of production' means: Choices: a) the way in which products are made in a factory b) the average measure of productivity under capitalism c) the organization of a society's technical and human resources d) an integral part of the superstructure of a society 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the term 'mode of production' in the context of Marx's theory.  According to Marx,  the mode of production refers to the way in which goods and services are produced and distributed within a society.
 Next,  I will compare the given choices to the definition of the mode of production.  Choice a) focuses on a specific production site (a factory),  which is too narrow.  Choice b) refers to an average measure of productivity,  which is not the core concept of the mode of production.  Choice c) aligns with Marx's definition,  as it describes the organization of a society's technical and human resources,  which are essential components of the mode of production.  Choice d) mentions the superstructure,  which is related to the mode of production but is not an integral part of it.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The trend of decarceration involves: Choices: a) community alternatives to imprisonment and institutional care b) the increased use of imprisonment as the main form of punishment c) transferring the management of prisons to private companies d) decentralized organization due to the mobility of capital 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of decarceration.  Decarceration refers to the reduction in the number of people incarcerated in prisons and jails.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  a) community alternatives to imprisonment and institutional care suggests reducing the use of prisons by using community-based solutions.  b) the increased use of imprisonment as the main form of punishment is the opposite of decarceration.  c) transferring the management of prisons to private companies does not necessarily lead to decarceration.  d) decentralized organization due to the mobility of capital is not directly related to decarceration.
 The choice that best aligns with the concept of decarceration is a) community alternatives to imprisonment and institutional care.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

 First,  I need to analyze each choice and compare it to Smart's work.
 a) Smart's work did not suggest that the rates of violent crime were similar for men and women.
 b) Smart's work did not suggest that women's sexual delinquency was more likely to be normalized than men's.
 c) Smart's work suggested that women's criminal behavior tended to reflect traditional gender roles.

"Input: Allen's (2001 ) study of nurses showed that: Choices: a) nurses perform a great deal of emotional labour for which they are not paid b) the policies of Project 2000  had the effect of de-professionalising the career of nursing c) more men were moving into nursing,  which challenges some of the prevailing stereotypes about the occupation d) the role of the nurse was ambiguous and had to be constantly redefined in the context of everyday interactions with other staff and patients 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the main findings of Allen's (2001) study of nurses.  The study found that nurses perform a great deal of emotional labour for which they are not paid (choice a).
 Next,  I need to consider if any of the other choices are supported by the study.  Choice b) discusses the effects of Project 2000,  which is not mentioned in the input.  Choice c) mentions the movement of men into nursing,  which is not addressed in the input.  Choice d) discusses the ambiguity of the nurse's role,  which is not explicitly mentioned in the input.

 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the main topics that Dahrendorf,  Rex,  and Habermas focused on.  Dahrendorf is known for his work on gender and the concept of 'united we stand,  divided we fall',  which emphasizes the importance of social cohesion and solidarity.  Rex,  a sociologist,  focused on the interpretive understanding of action,  which is the process of understanding human behavior through the meanings people attach to it.  Habermas is known for his work on the public sphere,  power,  and domination,  which are all related to the concept of 'the interpretive understanding of action'.

Considering the main topics of their work,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the options given for resisting American cultural domination of the media.  Option a) suggests domesticating its content,  including more 'home-produced' programmes.  Option b) suggests controlling the distribution of imported products by banning satellite dishes.  Option c) suggests creating 'reverse flows' of their own programmes back to imperial societies.

"Input: Mulholland (1998 ) argued that privatization changed the relationship between companies and managers in that: Choices: a) flexibility was reduced by the introduction of detailed daily worksheets b) the state had greater control than managers over production processes c) ownership was transferred from small shareholders to senior managers d) employment depended on performance rather than trust and commitment 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of Mulholland's argument.  He argued that privatization changed the relationship between companies and managers.
 Next,  I need to consider each choice and see if it aligns with Mulholland's argument.
 a) Flexibility was reduced by the introduction of detailed daily worksheets.  This choice suggests that privatization led to less flexibility, which could be a result of increased regulation or oversight.
 b) The state had greater control than managers over production processes.  This choice contradicts Mulholland's argument, as he argued that privatization changed the relationship between companies and managers, not between the state and managers.
 c) Ownership was transferred from small shareholders to senior managers.  This choice could be a result of privatization, but it does not directly address the relationship between companies and managers as Mulholland argued.
 d) Employment depended on performance rather than trust and commitment.  This choice aligns with Mulholland's argument, as it suggests that privatization changed the relationship between companies and managers by emphasizing performance-based employment rather than trust and commitment.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following is consistent with results of current research conducted in the area of gender roles and the workplace?  Choices: a) In about a quarter of households with children,  men stay home with the children so their wives can work.  b) Most women believe that there is equal opportunity today between men and women in career choice,  advancement,  and income.  c) Most men believe that women should be homemakers because men earn more money.  d) Most men married to working women do not share housework and childcare obligations equally with their working wives.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the current research on gender roles and the workplace.  Research has shown that there is still a significant gap in career choice,  advancement,  and income between men and women.  Furthermore,  research has found that men and women have different views on gender roles in the home and workplace.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice based on the research findings.  Choice a) suggests that men staying home with children is a common occurrence,  but this does not align with the research findings on gender roles in the workplace.  Choice b) claims that there is equal opportunity between men and women,  which contradicts the research findings.  Choice c) suggests that men believe women should be homemakers,  but this is not consistent with the research findings on gender roles in the workplace.  Choice d) states that most men do not share housework and childcare equally with working wives,  which is consistent with the research findings on gender roles in the workplace.

"Input: Socialization is: Choices: a) the formation of an attachment bond between an infant and its carer b) a tendency of social theorists to explain everything in terms of social causes c) the process of becoming part of a society by learning its norms and values d) the historical process by which societies change from traditional to modern 
 Output:
 First,  I will analyze each choice to determine which one best defines socialization.
 a) The formation of an attachment bond between an infant and its carer is a part of socialization,  but it is not the entire definition.  Socialization involves learning and adapting to society,  not just forming attachments.
 b) A tendency of social theorists to explain everything in terms of social causes is not a definition of socialization.  It is an observation about the way some theorists approach their work,  but it does not capture the essence of socialization.
 c) The process of becoming part of a society by learning its norms and values is a comprehensive definition of socialization.  It encompasses the various aspects of socialization,  such as learning language,  behaviors,  and values to fit into society.
 d) The historical process by which societies change from traditional to modern is related to social change,  but it is not the same as socialization.  Socialization is about the individual's process of becoming part of a society,  not the transformation of societies.

Based on the analysis,  the best definition of socialization is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The term 'assets' refers to: Choices: a) the culturally valued commodities and standards of living that make the poor feel relatively deprived b) the flow of money a person receives from their salary or wage c) a stock of economic resources,  including land,  shares and bank deposits d) the 'slices' of the population who own differing amounts of wealth 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the term 'assets'.  Assets are resources that have economic value and are owned by an individual or entity.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice based on this definition.
 a) This choice talks about the poor feeling relatively deprived,  which is not related to the definition of assets.
 b) This choice refers to a flow of money,  which is related to income,  not assets.
 c) This choice defines assets as a stock of economic resources,  which aligns with the definition of assets.
 d) This choice refers to the distribution of wealth among different groups,  which is related to income inequality,  not assets.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

"Input: Social norms are: Choices: a) creative activities such as gardening,  cookery and craftwork b) the symbolic representation of social groups in the mass media c) religious beliefs about how the world ought to be d) rules and expectations about interaction that regulate social life 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what social norms are.  Social norms are rules and expectations about interaction that regulate social life.  This means they are about how people should behave in different situations.
 Next,  I need to compare each choice to the definition of social norms.  a) creative activities such as gardening,  cookery and craftwork are not rules or expectations about interaction,  so they are not social norms.  b) the symbolic representation of social groups in the mass media is not about how people should behave,  so it is not social norms.  c) religious beliefs about how the world ought to be are not necessarily about how people should behave in social situations,  so they are not necessarily social norms.
 The only choice that matches the definition of social norms is d) rules and expectations about interaction that regulate social life.  This is exactly what social norms are.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

 First,  I need to consider the rise of new social movements.  These movements often focus on personal,  cultural,  and environmental issues,  as well as economic interests.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  Option a) suggests that people vote based on pragmatic issues and concerns,  which is a possible reason for the rise of new social movements.
 Option b) states that consumer identities are more important than class identities,  which could also be a reason for the rise of new social movements,  as these movements often emphasize individual identity and personal values.
 Option c) suggests that personal,  cultural,  and environmental issues can mobilize political consciousness just as much as economic interests,  which directly aligns with the characteristics of new social movements.
 Finally,  I need to determine which option best represents the rise of new social movements.  Option d) states that all of the above are reasons for the rise of new social movements,  which is the most comprehensive answer.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

"Input: Post-Fordist forms of media production and consumption involve: Choices: a) the mass production of standardized products for passive audiences b) television based on producer-broadcaster rather than publisher-broadcaster models c) a diverse range of products aimed at niche markets d) increasing numbers of advertisements for motoring and car-related products 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the concept of post-Fordist forms of media production and consumption.  Post-Fordist refers to a system that is more flexible and diverse than the Fordist model, which was characterized by mass production of standardized products.

Next,  we can evaluate each choice in the context of post-Fordist media production and consumption.

a) the mass production of standardized products for passive audiences - This choice describes the characteristics of the Fordist model, not post-Fordist.

b) television based on producer-broadcaster rather than publisher-broadcaster models - This choice refers to a specific type of television model, not the broader concept of post-Fordist media production and consumption.

c) a diverse range of products aimed at niche markets - This choice aligns with the concept of post-Fordism, as it describes a more flexible and diverse system, with products tailored to specific niche markets.

d) increasing numbers of advertisements for motoring and car-related products - This choice is specific to the motoring industry and does not represent the broader concept of post-Fordist media production and consumption.

"Input: Sociologists like Bordo (1993 ) have attributed the 'epidemic' of anorexia in Western cultures to: Choices: a) a generally ascetic,  frugal lifestyle that can be taken to extremes b) traditional images of women as emotional,  domesticated,  and unassertive c) the social construction of mental illness,  through which 'normal' patterns of behaviour are pathologized d) the new ideal of independent,  self-assured femininity,  combined with cultural values of achievement and control 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the question.  The question is about the attribution of the 'epidemic' of anorexia in Western cultures by sociologists like Bordo (1993).
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice in the context of the question.  a) suggests that anorexia is a result of a generally ascetic,  frugal lifestyle,  which is not directly related to the epidemic of anorexia.  b) mentions traditional images of women,  which could be a factor,  but it doesn't address the epidemic aspect.  c) discusses the social construction of mental illness,  which could be relevant,  but it doesn't specifically address the epidemic of anorexia in Western cultures.  d) combines the new ideal of independent,  self-assured femininity with cultural values of achievement and control,  which could explain the epidemic of anorexia in Western cultures.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: One of the difficulties in 'operationalizing' concepts like social class is that: Choices: a) definitions and indicators can vary,  making valid comparisons problematic b) there are no reliable indicators of such widely contested ideas c) it takes all the fun out of armchair theorising d) it has little use for applied,  empirical research about the topic 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the nature of the concepts being discussed.  Social class is a complex and contested concept,  with different definitions and indicators being used by different scholars.
 Next,  I need to consider the implications of these differences.  Different definitions and indicators can lead to different results and interpretations,  making it difficult to make valid comparisons between different studies and analyses.
 Finally,  I need to consider the other answer choices and eliminate those that do not fit the criteria.  Choice b) suggests that there are no reliable indicators,  which is not necessarily true,  as there are several indicators that are commonly used in research on social class.  Choice c) is not relevant to the difficulty of operationalizing a concept.  Choice d) suggests that the concept has little use for applied,  empirical research,  which is not necessarily true,  as applied,  empirical research is often necessary to understand and analyze social phenomena.

"Input: In the 1990  reform of the National Health Service,  hospitals became: Choices: a) self-governing trusts competing for purchasing contracts from health authorities b) state-controlled providers,  dependent on funding from the central government c) increasingly detached from health authorities and providers of private health care d) less inclined to run themselves efficiently,  as demand for health care was falling 
 Output:
 First,  I need to recall the 1990  reform of the National Health Service.  This reform was known as the ""Hunt reforms"" or the ""internal market.""
 Next,  I need to understand the main components of this reform.  One of the key changes was the creation of self-governing hospitals,  which were known as ""hospital trusts.""
 Finally,  I need to match the reform's outcomes with the given choices.  The 1990  reform led to hospitals becoming self-governing trusts that competed for purchasing contracts from health authorities.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Law and order was privatized in the 1980 s and 1990 s through: Choices: a) the expansion of private security companies b) the building of private prisons c) the introduction of market disciplines to measure police performance d) all of the above 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the choices given and evaluate them based on the information provided.
 Choice a) the expansion of private security companies is a privatization method that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s.  Private security companies were indeed established during this time to provide additional services to law enforcement.
 Choice b) the building of private prisons is also a privatization method that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s.  Private prisons were established during this time to provide an alternative to public prisons.
 Choice c) the introduction of market disciplines to measure police performance is another privatization method that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s.  Market-based measures were introduced to evaluate and improve police performance.
 All three choices a, b, and c are valid methods of privatization that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The 'correspondence principle' (Bowles & Gintis) suggests that: Choices: a) schools prepare children for work by teaching them to be obedient b) teachers and parents tend to have similar attitudes to learning c) children who write lots of letters develop a better grasp of language d) boys' and girls' educational achievements have recently become similar 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the 'correspondence principle' as described by Bowles & Gintis.  The principle suggests that institutions and practices that were once based on biological differences between groups (such as men and women) may now be based on social and economic differences.  It implies that the original function of these institutions may still have an influence, even though the conditions that originally justified them no longer exist.

Next,  I need to evaluate each choice in the context of the 'correspondence principle.'

a) schools prepare children for work by teaching them to be obedient - This choice aligns with the 'correspondence principle' because schools, like other institutions, may still have functions related to their historical origins, even though their current purpose is different. Teaching children to be obedient could be seen as a remnant of the original function of schools to prepare children for work in a specific context.

b) teachers and parents tend to have similar attitudes to learning - This choice does not directly relate to the 'correspondence principle' as it discusses attitudes rather than the historical origins and functions of institutions.

c) children who write lots of letters develop a better grasp of language - This choice is more about the practical effect of writing on language development rather than the 'correspondence principle.'

d) boys' and girls' educational achievements have recently become similar - This choice is about the current state of educational achievement and does not address the 'correspondence principle.'

Based on the analysis, the choice that best aligns with the 'correspondence principle' as described by Bowles & Gintis is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Class segregation was apparent in mid-twentieth century Britain insofar as: Choices: a) middle class owner-occupiers moved into the inner city through gentrification b) working class communities formed in the inner cities,  while the middle classes moved out to the suburbs c) the middle classes lived in the countryside while the working class lived in the city d) the upper and middle classes dominated public space,  while working class people were more home-centred 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of class segregation in mid-twentieth century Britain.  During this time,  there was a significant shift in residential patterns,  with the middle class moving out of the inner cities and into the suburbs,  while the working class communities remained in the inner cities.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice in the context of this historical period.  Choice a suggests that middle class owner-occupiers moved into the inner city through gentrification,  which is not accurate,  as they were moving out of the inner cities.
 Choice b correctly describes the residential patterns of the time,  with working class communities forming in the inner cities,  while the middle classes moved out to the suburbs.
 Choice c is partially correct,  as the middle classes did live in the suburbs,  but it does not accurately describe the inner cities.
 Choice d describes the social dynamics of the time,  but it does not specifically address the residential patterns of class segregation.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Charles Cooley's theory of the looking-glass self emphasizes Choices: a) the manner in which young children come to a realization that they have a separate identity b) the difficulty one experiences in seeing oneself as others do c) how one's self-concept is based on one's perception of how others see one d) how one's self-concept is heavily influenced by one's physical appearance 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the key components of Charles Cooley's theory of the looking-glass self. This theory posits that an individual's self-concept is formed through a process of imagining how others perceive them. This process involves three main stages: the imagination of how one appears to others, the interpretation of how one is perceived, and the re-evaluation of oneself based on this perceived image.

Now, let's evaluate the choices given:

a) The manner in which young children come to a realization that they have a separate identity - This choice is related to the development of identity but does not specifically focus on the process of how one's self-concept is formed through others' perceptions, which is the core of the looking-glass self theory.

b) The difficulty one experiences in seeing oneself as others do - This choice touches on the idea of self-perception but does not capture the essence of the looking-glass self theory, which is about the process of imagining how others perceive us.

c) How one's self-concept is based on one's perception of how others see one - This choice directly aligns with the core concept of the looking-glass self theory, which emphasizes that our self-concept is formed through our imagination of how we appear to others and the subsequent interpretation of this imagined perception.

d) How one's self-concept is heavily influenced by one's physical appearance - While physical appearance can be a factor in how others perceive us, this choice narrows the focus to only physical appearance and does not encompass the broader process of self-concept formation through others' perceptions as described by the looking-glass self theory.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Queer Theory makes the claim that: Choices: a) heterosexuality is the normal and most desirable way to be b) the sexual categories and discourses we use are based upon true,  underlying biological differences c) deviant forms of masculinity are seen as more threatening to the gender order than deviant forms of femininity d) all sexualities are pluralistic,  fragmented and frequently reconstructed 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the main claim of Queer Theory.  Queer Theory argues that the sexual categories and discourses we use are not based on true,  underlying biological differences.
 Next,  I need to compare this claim to the given choices.  Choice a) discusses heterosexuality as the normal and most desirable way to be,  which is not the main claim of Queer Theory.
 Choice b) states that the sexual categories and discourses we use are based upon true,  underlying biological differences,  which contradicts the main claim of Queer Theory.
 Choice c) talks about the threat of deviant forms of masculinity to the gender order,  which is not the main focus of Queer Theory.
 Choice d) claims that all sexualities are pluralistic,  fragmented,  and frequently reconstructed,  which aligns with the main claim of Queer Theory.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Scott (1991 ) introduced the term 'power elite' to describe: Choices: a) the ruling class,  or bourgeoisie,  who exploit the proletariat b) a capitalist class dependent on property ownership and advantaged life chances c) an alignment of classes with shared interests but no state power d) a state elite whose members are drawn overwhelmingly from a power bloc 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify who Scott (1991 ) is.  Scott (1991 ) refers to James C. Scott,  an anthropologist.
 Next,  I need to understand the term 'power elite'.  The term 'power elite' was introduced by C. Wright Mills in his book ""The Power Elite"" (1956).  However,  James C. Scott later adapted and expanded on this concept in his book ""The Art of Not Being Governed"" (1999).
 Now,  I need to determine which choice best describes Scott's interpretation of the 'power elite'.  In his book ""The Art of Not Being Governed"",  Scott describes the 'power elite' as a state elite whose members are drawn overwhelmingly from a power bloc.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A sociologist is conducting research on institutional power relations at a local hospital.  The sociologist is on staff at the hospital for several weeks,  recording data as field notes.  This method of research is called Choices: a) experimentation b) secondary data analysis c) participant observation d) survey administration 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the type of research method being described.  The sociologist is on staff at the hospital,  which means they are directly involved in the setting they are studying.
 Next,  the sociologist is recording data as field notes,  which means they are collecting data while actively observing the environment.
 The method of research that involves being directly involved in the setting and collecting data while observing is called participant observation.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: In Symbolic Interactionist theory,  Mead defined the 'generalized other' as: Choices: a) the group of structural theories of society that he was reacting against b) the overall impression of ourselves that we try to give off to others c) a significant figure in early childhood who teaches us the general values of society d) an image of how people in the wider society might perceive our behaviour 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of the 'generalized other' in Symbolic Interactionist theory.  The generalized other is a concept introduced by George Herbert Mead, an American philosopher and psychologist.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given and see which one aligns with the definition of the generalized other.  The generalized other refers to the collective expectations and norms of society that individuals internalize and act upon.
 Now,  I can eliminate choices a) and c) because they do not accurately describe the generalized other.  The generalized other is not a group of structural theories or a significant figure in early childhood, but rather the collective expectations of society.
 Between choices b) and d),  the generalized other is more accurately described by choice d) an image of how people in the wider society might perceive our behavior.  The generalized other encompasses the collective expectations of society, which includes how individuals might perceive our behavior.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: According to Davis (1995 ),  women may seek cosmetic surgery because: Choices: a) they have a deep-rooted sense of ineffectiveness and are striving for control b) they are in pursuit of the 'perfect' body,  fuelled by images of beauty c) they perceive a part of their body as stigmatizing,  in relation to a cultural ideal d) their male partners pressurize them to look like supermodels 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the statement.  The statement is from Davis (1995),  which is a source discussing the reasons why women may seek cosmetic surgery.
 Next,  I need to consider each of the given choices and evaluate which one is supported by the context of the statement.  The statement does not mention ineffectiveness,  control,  or pressure from male partners.
 The statement does mention the pursuit of the 'perfect' body and the influence of images of beauty.  This choice is supported by the context of the statement.
 The statement also mentions the perception of a part of the body as stigmatizing,  in relation to a cultural ideal.  This choice is also supported by the context of the statement.
 Therefore,  the correct answers are {'sol': 'b'}"

 Next,  I need to consider the choices provided.  a) the product they were making,  b) the production process,  c) each other and humanity in general,  and d) all of the above.
 Now,  I need to recall Marx's main points on alienation.  Marx claimed that workers are alienated from their products,  the process of production,  their fellow workers,  and from humanity as a whole.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of Herberg's study.  Herberg's (1955) study focused on the relationship between religion and American society.
 Next,  I need to consider each of the choices and see if they align with the findings of the study.  a) Ethnic minorities practiced religion to achieve social acceptance in the culture, which is a possible interpretation of the study.  b) Mainstream faiths were becoming increasingly identified with national identity, which is also a possible interpretation.  c) The moral teachings of the main religions were becoming relatively similar, which is another possible interpretation.

 First,  I need to understand the traditional working class identity.  This identity was based on the social and economic conditions of people who worked in the manufacturing industry and were part of the proletariat.
 Next,  I need to consider the options given.  Option a) refers to shared working conditions,  which is part of the traditional working class identity.  Option b) refers to the class consciousness of members of the proletariat,  which is also part of the traditional working class identity.  Option c) refers to local communities,  extended kinship networks,  and shared leisure pursuits,  which were important aspects of the traditional working class identity.  Option d) refers to collective aspirations to move into the middle class,  which is a part of the traditional working class identity but not the primary basis.

"Input: Bernstein thought that using 'restricted codes' of language disadvantaged pupils at school because: Choices: a) this pattern of speech made them the target of bullying b) they referred to explicit,  context independent meanings c) they prevented children from communicating outside of their peer groups d) they involved short,  simple sentences with a small vocabulary 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand what 'restricted codes' of language are.  These are the language patterns typically used by children from lower socio-economic backgrounds,  which are often characterized by short,  simple sentences with a small vocabulary.
 Bernstein believed that these restricted codes disadvantaged pupils at school because they prevented children from communicating outside of their peer groups.  This is because the language used in school is different from the language used in their everyday lives,  and using restricted codes can make it difficult for them to understand and participate in academic discussions.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

"Input: Frank (1967 ) made the claim that 'underdeveloped' societies were: Choices: a) insufficiently involved in the international capitalist economy b) reluctant to surrender their traditional ways of life c) economically dependent on the wealthy countries that exploited them d) the 'metropoles' to which 'satellite' countries were attached 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the context of Frank's claim.  Frank was an economist who argued against the traditional view of underdeveloped societies.
 Next,  we need to consider each choice and see which one aligns with Frank's view.  a) is not correct because Frank argued that underdeveloped societies were actually involved too much in the international capitalist economy, not too little.  b) is not correct because Frank believed that underdeveloped societies were not reluctant to change, but rather were forced into traditional ways of life by the wealthy countries.  c) is correct because Frank argued that underdeveloped societies were economically dependent on the wealthy countries that exploited them.  d) is not correct because Frank did not view underdeveloped societies as 'satellite' countries dependent on 'metropoles.'

"Input: The print revolution of the nineteenth century resulted in: Choices: a) mass production,  mass circulation,  and the decline of serious content b) the public ownership of newspapers as a shared resource c) more people going to the cinema as a new leisure activity d) a reduction of 'virtual communities' on the Internet 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the impact of the print revolution of the nineteenth century.  This revolution was characterized by the development of new printing technologies that made it easier and cheaper to produce printed materials.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the choices given in relation to the impact of the print revolution.  Choice a) mass production,  mass circulation,  and the decline of serious content is a direct result of the increased accessibility and affordability of printed materials.
 Choice b) the public ownership of newspapers as a shared resource is not a direct result of the print revolution,  as the public ownership of newspapers is a political and social concept rather than a technological one.
 Choice c) more people going to the cinema as a new leisure activity is not related to the print revolution,  as the cinema was invented in the late nineteenth century,  after the print revolution.
 Choice d) a reduction of 'virtual communities' on the Internet is not related to the print revolution,  as the Internet is a product of the twentieth century and virtual communities are a modern concept.

"Input: Marx proclaimed that religion would disappear when: Choices: a) a new trend of moral individualism became established b) a socialist revolution removed the need for capitalist ideology c) church attendance dropped below 15 % d) people came to believe more in science and technology 
 Output:
 First, I need to consider the context of Marx's views on religion. Karl Marx believed that religion was a product of society and that it would disappear as society progressed and the needs that religion served were eliminated.

Next, I need to evaluate each choice in relation to Marx's views.

a) A new trend of moral individualism becoming established - This choice suggests that as society moved away from the individualistic values promoted by religion, religion would disappear. This aligns with Marx's view that religion would vanish as society progressed.

b) A socialist revolution removing the need for capitalist ideology - This choice suggests that Marx believed religion would disappear with the establishment of a socialist society. This is consistent with Marx's view that religion would disappear as society progressed and the capitalist system was replaced.

c) Church attendance dropping below 15% - This choice is not directly related to Marx's views on the disappearance of religion. Marx did not base his prediction on the numerical decline of religious adherents.

d) People coming to believe more in science and technology - This choice suggests that as society became more scientifically and technologically advanced, religion would disappear. While this is a possible outcome of societal progress, it is not specifically what Marx predicted. Marx believed that religion would disappear as a result of societal and economic changes, not solely due to an increase in scientific knowledge.

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider which of the given factors is most commonly used to gauge a person's social status in modern societies.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice:
 a) Age: While age can sometimes influence social status,  it is not the primary measure in modern societies.
 b) Income: Income is a significant factor in determining a person's social status,  as it often correlates with access to resources,  education,  and opportunities.
 c) Verbal fluency: Verbal fluency is an important skill,  but it is not typically used as a primary measure of social status.
 d) Occupation: Occupation is a common way to gauge a person's social status,  as certain professions are associated with higher social standing.

After evaluating each choice,  it is clear that income is the most commonly used factor to measure a person's social status in modern societies.

"Input: Sociology differs from common sense in that: Choices: a) it focuses on the researchers' own experiences b) it makes little distinction between the way the world is and the way it ought to be c) its knowledge is accumulated from many different research contexts d) it is subjective and biased 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the difference between sociology and common sense.  Sociology is a scientific discipline that studies human society and social interaction,  while common sense refers to general beliefs and practices that are widely accepted without formal study.
 Next,  we can evaluate each choice in relation to the difference between the two.  Choice a) suggests that sociology focuses on researchers' own experiences,  which is not true because sociology aims to study society objectively,  not based on personal experiences.
 Choice b) states that sociology makes little distinction between the way the world is and the way it ought to be.  This is actually a characteristic of sociology,  as it focuses on understanding social phenomena as they exist,  without necessarily proposing changes or improvements.
 Choice c) claims that sociology's knowledge is accumulated from many different research contexts.  This is true,  as sociology relies on a variety of research methods and sources to build its knowledge base.
 Choice d) suggests that sociology is subjective and biased.  While it is true that all scientific knowledge is based on human interpretation, sociology aims to be objective and unbiased by using systematic research methods and peer review to validate findings.

 Choice a) suggests that white-collar crime involves only small amounts of money,  which is not necessarily true.  White-collar crimes can involve large amounts of money.
 Choice b) claims that the proletariat can outsmart the bourgeoisie,  which is not directly related to the visibility of white-collar crime.
 Choice c) states that the police turn a blind eye to corporate crime,  which is not a widely accepted fact and may not be the main reason for the low visibility of white-collar crime.
 Choice d) suggests that white-collar crime goes undetected in the context of everyday business transactions,  which is a plausible reason for its low visibility.  White-collar crimes often blend in with normal business activities,  making them difficult to detect.

"Input: The 'demographic transition' is a social trend that involves: Choices: a) a reduction in population size,  caused by a higher rate of emigration than immigration b) a change in the principal causes of death and disease since industrialization c) increased birth and death rates,  resulting in a relatively young population d) a decline in the birth rate,  greater life expectancy,  and an ageing population 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what the 'demographic transition' is.  It refers to a shift in the birth and death rates of a population,  as a country moves from a pre-industrial to an industrialized state.
 Next,  I need to consider each choice and see if it matches the definition of the demographic transition.
 a) A reduction in population size is not the main focus of the demographic transition.  It is more about changes in birth and death rates.
 b) A change in the principal causes of death and disease since industrialization is related to improvements in public health,  but it is not the main focus of the demographic transition.
 c) Increased birth and death rates,  resulting in a relatively young population,  is not the correct description of the demographic transition.  The transition involves a change in these rates.
 d) A decline in the birth rate,  greater life expectancy,  and an ageing population accurately describes the demographic transition.  As a country industrializes,  birth rates tend to decline,  and life expectancy increases,  leading to an ageing population.

"Input: Which of the following is not recognised as a level of society?  Choices: a) the household b) the office c) the global village d) the nation state 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the definition of a level of society.  A level of society typically refers to a social structure or setting where people interact and form relationships.
 Next,  I will go through the choices and evaluate which one does not fit the definition.  The household is a level of society as it is a social structure where family members interact and form relationships.  The office is also a level of society as it is a place where people work and interact with colleagues.  The global village is a level of society as it refers to the interconnectedness of people around the world through technology and communication.  The nation state is a level of society as it is a political entity where people live and interact within a defined territory.
 Therefore,  the choice that is not recognised as a level of society is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Ethnic identity refers to: Choices: a) the objective categories of ethnicity used in the census b) a felt sense of group membership on the basis of religion,  language,  or history c) the imposition of a racial label on a minority by a powerful majority d) the fragmented and pluralistic nature of ethnicity 
 Output:
 First,  I will analyze each choice to determine which one best defines ethnic identity.
 a) The objective categories of ethnicity used in the census refers to the way ethnic groups are categorized in official records,  but it does not capture the subjective experience of ethnic identity.
 b) A felt sense of group membership on the basis of religion,  language,  or history refers to the personal and subjective experience of belonging to a particular ethnic group,  which aligns with the concept of ethnic identity.
 c) The imposition of a racial label on a minority by a powerful majority refers to a specific historical and political process,  but it does not define ethnic identity in general.
 d) The fragmented and pluralistic nature of ethnicity refers to the complexity and diversity of ethnic groups,  but it does not define the concept of ethnic identity itself.

After analyzing each choice,  I can conclude that the correct definition of ethnic identity is a felt sense of group membership on the basis of religion,  language,  or history.

Choice a) suggests that the proportion of people living alone has decreased,  which does not directly contribute to the decline of marriage.  Choice b) indicates that people are cohabiting in long term relationships,  which can be seen as a substitute for marriage.  Choice c) explains that remarriages are increasing,  which partially compensates for the decrease in first marriages.

 Third,  I need to consider if all of the above factors are contributing to the decline of marriage.  Choice b) and c) both contribute to the decline of marriage,  as they show alternatives to marriage and a partial compensation for the decrease in first marriages.

"Input: The use of 'indentured labour' in the nineteenth century involved: Choices: a) people being transported to the British colonies and forced to work for one employer under poor conditions b) the sale of African people through the slave trade in the 'Atlantic triangle' c) selecting the most skilled workers in factories to promote their employer's company overseas d) extracting the teeth of the laziest workers to stop them from talking 
 Output:
 First, I need to understand what 'indentured labour' means. Indentured labour refers to a system where people agree to work for a certain period of time in exchange for passage to a new country or for their freedom.
 Next, I need to consider the time period mentioned, which is the nineteenth century. During this time, the British Empire was expanding and needed workers for its colonies.
 Now, I can evaluate the choices based on this information. Choice a) describes a situation where people are transported to the British colonies and forced to work for one employer under poor conditions, which aligns with the concept of indentured labour.
 Choice b) refers to the sale of African people through the slave trade, which is a different system and not indentured labour.
 Choice c) describes a situation where skilled workers are selected for overseas promotion, which does not match the concept of indentured labour.
 Choice d) mentions extracting teeth from lazy workers, which is a fictional and extreme scenario and not related to indentured labour.
 Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Cultural restructuring has involved: Choices: a) regenerating cities in economic decline b) turning industrial landscapes into tourist attractions c) selling sites and images through the 'symbolic economy' of media advertising d) all of the above 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider each choice and see if it is a part of cultural restructuring.
 a) Regenerating cities in economic decline can be a part of cultural restructuring,  as it involves transforming the cultural landscape of a city.
 b) Turning industrial landscapes into tourist attractions can also be a part of cultural restructuring,  as it involves changing the perception and use of these landscapes.
 c) Selling sites and images through the 'symbolic economy' of media advertising can be a part of cultural restructuring,  as it involves the commodification of cultural sites and images.
 d) Since all the previous choices are parts of cultural restructuring,  this choice is also valid.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

"Input: Which of the following is the most important agent of socialization in early childhood?  Choices: a) A preschool provider b) A peer group c) The mass media d) The family 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the context of early childhood,  which typically refers to the period from birth to age 8 or 12.  During this time,  children are most influenced by those who are close to them and have a significant role in their daily lives.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the choices based on the importance of each agent of socialization during early childhood.  A preschool provider plays a role in the development of children,  but it is not the most consistent or long-lasting influence compared to other options.  A peer group is important,  but it is not the most influential agent during early childhood.  The mass media has a significant impact on society,  but its influence on early childhood is not as direct or consistent as other options.  The family,  on the other hand,  is the most consistent and long-lasting influence on children during early childhood,  as they spend the most time with family members and learn values,  behaviors,  and beliefs from them.
 Therefore,  the most important agent of socialization in early childhood is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following is not a 'research purpose'?  Choices: a) triangulation b) explanation c) description d) exploration 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the purpose of research.  Research is conducted to gather information,  understand a phenomenon,  or solve a problem.  The purpose of research can be to describe,  explore,  explain,  or triangulate.
 Next,  I need to identify which of the choices is not a 'research purpose'.  Triangulation is a method used to improve the accuracy of data collection and analysis,  but it is not a purpose of research itself.  The purpose of research is to describe,  explore,  explain,  or triangulate the data.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: 'Scientific' theories in the nineteenth century tried to explain race in naturalistic terms.  Which of the following ideas was not considered?  Choices: a) genetics b) evolution c) height d) brain size 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify which of the choices was not considered as a naturalistic explanation for race in the nineteenth century.  The options are genetics,  evolution,  height,  and brain size.
 In the nineteenth century,  the understanding of genetics and evolution was not as advanced as it is today.  Genetics,  as a field,  was not fully developed until the early 20th century with Gregor Mendel's work on inheritance laws.  Evolution,  as a concept,  was proposed by Charles Darwin in the 1859 with the publication of ""On the Origin of Species,"" but it was not widely accepted until the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
 Height and brain size were more directly observable physical characteristics that could be compared between different populations,  and thus were more likely to be considered in explanations of race during the nineteenth century.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

"Input: Which of the following industries did Blauner (1964 ) suggest was most alienating to its employees?  Choices: a) machine-based factory work b) textile work as craft production c) car manufacturing in assembly plants d) chemical processing with automated practices 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the industry that Blauner (1964) suggested was most alienating to employees.  According to Blauner's research,  the most alienating industry is the one that involves a high degree of dehumanization and deindividualization.
 Next,  I need to consider each choice and evaluate its characteristics in terms of dehumanization and deindividualization.  Machine-based factory work involves repetitive tasks and a lack of control over the work process.  Textile work as craft production involves more individual control and skill.  Car manufacturing in assembly plants involve standardized tasks and a lack of control over the work process.  Chemical processing with automated practices involves a high degree of automation and a lack of control over the work process.
 Based on these characteristics,  the industry that is most alienating to employees,  according to Blauner (1964),  is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The 'decentralized city' can be identified by: Choices: a) the shift of employment and services away from the inner city towards multiple centres in smaller towns and rural areas b) the degendering of public space as women use local facilities more c) gentrification: the movement of middle class people back into the inner city d) all of the above 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a 'decentralized city' is.  A decentralized city is one where there is a distribution of employment, services, and population across multiple centers, rather than being concentrated in a single area.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice in relation to the definition.
 a) The shift of employment and services away from the inner city towards multiple centers in smaller towns and rural areas aligns with the definition of a decentralized city.
 b) The degendering of public space as women use local facilities more is not directly related to the concept of decentralization.
 c) Gentrification, the movement of middle-class people back into the inner city, can contribute to decentralization by increasing the demand for services and employment in the inner city, but it is not the sole factor.
 d) Since choice a) is directly related to the definition of a decentralized city, and choices b) and c) are not, this choice is incorrect.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Lombroso claimed that: Choices: a) criminals were socialized into an 'underworld' of crime b) no act is intrinsically deviant c) biological failings drove some people into crime d) women were less likely to be arrested than men 
 Output:
 First, let's consider each choice and evaluate its relevance to Lombroso's theory.

 a) criminals were socialized into an 'underworld' of crime - This choice aligns with the concept of social deviance, but it is not specifically related to Lombroso's theory. Lombroso's focus was on the biological and physical differences between criminals and non-criminals.

 b) no act is intrinsically deviant - This choice is more aligned with labeling theory, which argues that deviance is not inherent in behavior but is determined by society through its labeling practices. Lombroso's theory did not emphasize this aspect.

 c) biological failings drove some people into crime - This choice is directly related to Lombroso's theory. Lombroso believed that certain physical and biological traits were indicative of a predisposition to criminality.

 d) women were less likely to be arrested than men - This choice is not directly related to Lombroso's theory. While it may be true in some historical contexts, it is not a central tenet of Lombroso's work.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Warner and Myrdal claimed that black former slaves were not joining the 'ethnic melting pot' of the North American cities because: Choices: a) the white population did not believe in liberty,  equality,  and democracy b) they wanted to retain a strong sense of their original ethnic identity c) they were not prepared to leave the Southern states and move to North America d) the promise of citizenship was contradicted by continued discrimination 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the context of the claim made by Warner and Myrdal.  They were discussing the reasons why black former slaves were not integrating into the ethnic melting pot of North American cities.

Next,  we can evaluate each choice in the context of their claim.  Choice a) suggests that the white population did not believe in the principles of liberty,  equality,  and democracy,  which is not directly related to the integration process.  Choice b) mentions the desire to retain a strong sense of original ethnic identity,  which could be a reason for not fully integrating.  Choice c) states that black former slaves were not willing to leave the Southern states and move to North America,  which contradicts the fact that they were already former slaves seeking new opportunities.  Choice d) highlights the contradiction between the promise of citizenship and continued discrimination,  which could explain why they were not fully integrating into the melting pot.

Based on the evaluation,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: When Berger & Luckmann said that reality is socially constructed,  they meant: Choices: a) scientists are guided in their work by social values and interests,  so they define and measure phenomena that will support their theories b) people negotiate shared definitions of their situation and live according to these,  often forgetting that these social worlds are not fixed and external c) sociologists decide what constitutes social reality and measure only that d) terms like 'reality' have no deeper meaning beyond the level of discourse 
 Output:
 First, let's analyze each choice and see which one aligns with the concept of reality being socially constructed.

a) This choice suggests that scientists' social values and interests influence their work, but it doesn't directly address the idea that reality is constructed by society.

b) This choice aligns with the concept of reality being socially constructed, as it mentions people negotiating shared definitions and living according to these, often forgetting that these social worlds are not fixed and external.

c) This choice incorrectly suggests that sociologists decide what constitutes social reality, which contradicts the idea that reality is constructed by society, not by a specific group of people.

d) This choice discusses the meaning of terms like 'reality' but doesn't directly address the concept of reality being socially constructed.

"Input: Which of the following groups or organizations can be identified as having the characteristics of a bureaucracy?  Choices: a) An extended or consanguine family,  including all the relatives by blood,  marriage,  or adoption b) The government of a large city c) A book club in which books are chosen by members who take turns alphabetically to lead discussion d) The volunteers who gather annually to clean the neighborhood 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the characteristics of a bureaucracy.  A bureaucracy is typically characterized by a hierarchical structure,  rules and procedures,  and a division of labor.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice based on these characteristics.
 a) An extended or consanguine family does not have a formal hierarchical structure,  rules and procedures,  or a division of labor,  so it does not fit the characteristics of a bureaucracy.
 b) The government of a large city has a formal hierarchical structure,  rules and procedures,  and a division of labor,  so it can be identified as having the characteristics of a bureaucracy.
 c) A book club in which books are chosen by members who take turns alphabetically to lead discussion does not have a formal hierarchical structure,  rules and procedures,  or a division of labor,  so it does not fit the characteristics of a bureaucracy.
 d) The volunteers who gather annually to clean the neighborhood does not have a formal hierarchical structure,  rules and procedures,  or a division of labor,  so it does not fit the characteristics of a bureaucracy.

"Input: Pilcher (1999 ) identified soap operas as a 'feminine genre' of media because: Choices: a) most of the characters in soap operas are women b) they represent images of women as both domesticated and independent c) they alienate women and appeal to an audience of men d) female television producers are most likely to work in this area 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the options given and evaluate their relevance to Pilcher's claim that soap operas are a 'feminine genre'.

Option a) suggests that most characters in soap operas are women. While it's true that soap operas often have a high proportion of female characters, this alone does not necessarily make them a 'feminine genre'. Genre is more about the themes, narratives, and conventions that are commonly associated with a type of media, not just the gender of the characters.

Option b) mentions that soap operas represent images of women as both domesticated and independent. This option touches on the dual portrayal of women in soap operas, which could be seen as appealing to a broad audience, not just women. However, this alone does not define a genre as 'feminine'.

Option c) claims that soap operas alienate women and appeal to an audience of men. This option seems to contradict Pilcher's claim. If soap operas alienate women, they would not be considered a 'feminine genre'.

Option d) suggests that female television producers are most likely to work in this area. This option aligns with Pilcher's claim. If soap operas are produced by women, it is reasonable to assume that they would be considered a 'feminine genre', as it reflects the perspective and interests of women in media production.

 Output:
 First,  I will analyze each choice to see which one best defines the concept of political culture.
 a) This choice describes how cultural products reflect political ideologies,  which is related to cultural expression but not the core definition of political culture.
 b) This choice describes the basic beliefs and orientation toward politics shared by the members of a culture,  which aligns with the concept of political culture as a shared set of attitudes and values related to politics.
 c) This choice focuses on political beliefs and attitudes shared by people in public offices,  which is a subset of the broader concept of political culture that includes all members of a culture,  not just those in public offices.
 d) This choice refers to ideological biases of the mass media,  which is related to media influence but not the definition of political culture itself.

After analyzing each choice,  I can conclude that the best definition of political culture is b) basic beliefs and orientation toward politics that are shared widely by the members of a culture.

"Input: The population pyramid of a population that has had a slightly larger birth rate than death rate for several generations will most likely have which of the following shapes?  Choices: a) Wider at the top than in the middle b) Wider at the bottom than at the top c) Bulging in the middle d) Having parallel sides 
 Output:
 First,  consider the effect of a slightly larger birth rate than death rate on the population.  This means that more people are being born than dying,  which will lead to an increase in the number of individuals in each age group over time.
 Next,  think about the shape of the population pyramid.  The base of the pyramid represents the youngest age group,  and the top represents the oldest age group.  As the birth rate is slightly higher than the death rate,  the number of individuals in the youngest age group will be higher than the oldest age group.
 Therefore,  the population pyramid will be wider at the bottom than at the top.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: The 'new racism' refers to: Choices: a) a subtler form of prejudice,  masked by nationalist pride b) a post-modern deconstruction of racist ideas to reveal their lack of depth c) racist practices found in newly emerging areas of social life,  such as cyberspace d) an anti-fascist movement which challenges nationalist politics

 Output:
 First,  we need to understand what Goldthorpe identified as the 'service class'.  Goldthorpe defined the service class as those who were involved in providing services to others,  but not in the traditional sense of domestic service.
 Next,  we can eliminate options b) and c) because they are not related to Goldthorpe's definition of the service class.  Option b) refers to people working in consultancy firms,  which is not a part of Goldthorpe's definition,  and option c) refers to young men and women employed in domestic service in the nineteenth century,  which is a traditional form of service and not what Goldthorpe was referring to.
 This leaves us with options a) and d).  Option a) refers to those in non-manual occupations,  exercising authority on behalf of the state,  which could be part of Goldthorpe's service class.  Option d) refers to those who had worked in the armed services,  which could also be part of Goldthorpe's service class.

"Input: Industrial production in the nineteenth century was characterized by: Choices: a) increasing numbers of women in high status positions b) cottage industries and homeworkers doing piecework in the domestic sphere c) the 'managerial revolution' by which ownership and control became separate d) power-driven machinery and the concentration of workers in large workplaces 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the time period mentioned, which is the nineteenth century. This was a period of significant industrialization and technological advancements.

Next, let's evaluate each choice in the context of the nineteenth century.

a) Increasing numbers of women in high status positions - This choice seems unlikely during the nineteenth century, as women's rights and equality were not as advanced as they are today, and high status positions were typically held by men.

b) Cottage industries and homeworkers doing piecework in the domestic sphere - This choice refers to a pre-industrial or early-industrial scenario where production was decentralized and workers were often self-employed. While cottage industries and homeworkers did exist during the nineteenth century, they were gradually replaced by more centralized and mechanized production methods.

c) The 'managerial revolution' by which ownership and control became separate - This choice refers to a concept that occurred later in the industrialization process, particularly in the early 20th century. It describes the separation of ownership and management in larger corporations, which was a later development in industrial organization.

d) Power-driven machinery and the concentration of workers in large workplaces - This choice aligns well with the characteristics of industrial production in the nineteenth century. The period saw significant advancements in technology, including the use of steam power and other forms of mechanical energy to drive machinery. Additionally, the concentration of workers in large workplaces, such as factories, was a defining feature of this era's industrial production.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is the characteristic that best describes industrial production in the nineteenth century: {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The term 'collective consumption' (Castells 1977 ) refers to: Choices: a) the privatization of public services by the Conservative government b) the lifestyle practice of shopping in peer groups c) the form of tuberculosis suffered by those who collect stamps d) the provision of health,  housing,  and education services by the state 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the term 'collective consumption' in the context of the given source,  Castells 1977.  Collective consumption is a concept that refers to the provision of essential services to the public by the state,  such as health,  housing,  and education.
 Next,  I will compare this definition to the given choices.  Choice a) refers to privatization,  which is the opposite of collective consumption.  Choice b) refers to a lifestyle practice,  which is not the definition of collective consumption.  Choice c) refers to a form of tuberculosis,  which is unrelated to the concept.  Choice d) refers to the provision of health,  housing,  and education services by the state,  which matches the definition of collective consumption.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The deviant subculture of homosexuals who met in seventeenth and eighteenth century London was called the: Choices: a) pollies b) mollies c) dollies d) lollies 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the deviant subculture of homosexuals that met in seventeenth and eighteenth century London.  This subculture was known as the ""Mollys.""
 The term ""Molly"" originated from the Dutch word ""mollen,"" meaning ""mill,"" and was used to describe effeminate men.  They were often associated with cross-dressing and had a reputation for being sexually promiscuous.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Robert and Tanya are married and live with their three children.  Their family unit is called Choices: a) a family of orientation b) a nuclear family c) an extended family d) a communal family 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the characteristics of the family unit.  Robert and Tanya are married and live with their three children,  making them the parents.
 Next,  I need to consider the size and structure of the family.  There are four adults (Robert, Tanya, and the two parents) and three children,  for a total of seven members.
 Now,  I need to determine which type of family structure this falls into.  A family of orientation is typically a family where children are being raised,  but this definition does not specify the size or structure of the family.
 A nuclear family is a family consisting of two parents and their children,  which matches the description of this family.
 An extended family includes more than two generations,  which is not the case here.
 A communal family is a family that lives together in a community,  which is not the case here.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: In Durkheim's work,  the term 'collective representations' refers to: Choices: a) effervescent ceremonies that create a feeling of belonging b) images of gods or totems that are widely recognized c) shared ideas and moral values,  often symbolized by an object or figurehead d) ideological tools used to obscure class divisions 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of Durkheim's work.  Emile Durkheim was a French sociologist who focused on the study of social phenomena.
 Next,  I need to consider the definition of 'collective representations.'  In Durkheim's work,  collective representations refer to the shared ideas and symbols that bind a society together.
 Now,  I can compare the choices to the definition.  a) refers to specific rituals,  not shared ideas,  so it is not the correct answer.  b) refers to religious symbols,  which is a specific type of collective representation but not the general definition,  so it is not the correct answer.  c) matches the definition of collective representations,  as it describes shared ideas and moral values,  often symbolized by an object or figurehead.  d) refers to ideological tools,  which is not the same as collective representations.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following is not a characteristic of totalitarian societies?  Choices: a) indoctrination and propaganda b) freedom of movement for citizens c) one-party rule d) a centrally planned economy 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the characteristics of totalitarian societies.  Totalitarian societies typically have a strong emphasis on control and conformity.
 Next,  I will go through the choices and evaluate their relevance to totalitarian societies.  a) indoctrination and propaganda is a common characteristic,  as it is used to control the population and maintain the regime's power.  b) freedom of movement for citizens is not a characteristic of totalitarian societies,  as they often restrict movement to maintain control.  c) one-party rule is a characteristic,  as it ensures that there is no opposition to the ruling party.  d) a centrally planned economy is also a characteristic,  as it allows for greater control over the economy.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Freud's notion of the 'ego' referred to: Choices: a) the unconscious mass of instinctive drives that may be repressed b) the self as a whole: an unstable mix of conscious and unconscious elements c) the conscious part of the mind that regulates emotional drives on a practical,  rational level d) the neurotic part of the mind that longs for belonging and may suffer an inferiority complex 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand Freud's concept of the 'ego'.  Freud proposed that the mind is divided into three parts: the id, the ego, and the superego.
 The id represents the unconscious mass of instinctive drives that may be repressed,  so option a) is related to the id, not the ego.
 The superego represents the moral part of the mind, which is the neurotic part of the mind that longs for belonging and may suffer an inferiority complex,  so option d) is related to the superego, not the ego.
 Now,  I need to consider option b) the self as a whole: an unstable mix of conscious and unconscious elements.  This option describes the overall mind,  including both conscious and unconscious elements,  which aligns with Freud's view of the ego as the part that mediates between the id and the superego.
 Option c) the conscious part of the mind that regulates emotional drives on a practical,  rational level is a part of the ego, but it does not fully capture the essence of the ego as a whole.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following is a personal document with closed access?  Choices: a) government 'white paper' b) confidential medical records c) household account book d) the shares register of a business 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the nature of each document and its access level.  A government 'white paper' is a public document that provides an overview of a policy matter,  so it is not a personal document with closed access.
 Next,  confidential medical records are personal documents that are intended for the direct use of the patient and are kept confidential,  so they have closed access.
 A household account book is a personal document that contains financial information about the household,  but it may not necessarily be kept confidential or have closed access,  depending on the circumstances.
 The shares register of a business is a document that lists the shareholders and their shareholdings,  but it is not a personal document and is intended for the use of the business and its stakeholders,  so it does not have closed access.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

 First,  I need to identify the tripartite system.  The tripartite system is a system of education in the UK that was used to select pupils into different types of schools.
 Next,  I need to find the type of schools that were selected by the 11 + exam.  The 11 + exam was used to select pupils for grammar,  technical,  and secondary modern schools.

"Input: Durkheim defined social facts as: Choices: a) ways of acting,  thinking,  and feeling that are collective and social in origin b) the way scientists construct knowledge in a social context c) data collected about social phenomena that are proven to be correct d) ideas and theories that have no basis in the external,  physical world 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what Durkheim defined as social facts.  According to Durkheim,  social facts are ways of acting,  thinking,  and feeling that are collective and social in origin.
 This means that social facts are shared beliefs,  norms,  and values that are created and maintained by society as a whole,  rather than by individual actions or personal experiences.
 Comparing this definition to the given choices,  I can see that choice a) ways of acting,  thinking,  and feeling that are collective and social in origin matches the definition of social facts as defined by Durkheim.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: The media-themes model of media influence claims that: Choices: a) audiences selectively interpret what they want to hear b) content analysis is the best way to identify the themes covered by the media c) audiences passively absorb whatever messages they are given d) social interaction reinforces the ideas and images that audiences select 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the media-themes model of media influence.  This model suggests that audiences do not simply passively absorb messages but actively select and interpret them.
 Next,  we can evaluate each choice based on this understanding.  Choice a) audiences selectively interpret what they want to hear aligns with the idea that audiences actively select and interpret messages.
 Choice b) content analysis is a method used to analyze media content, but it does not directly relate to the media-themes model of media influence.
 Choice c) audiences passively absorb whatever messages they are given contradicts the media-themes model, which posits that audiences actively select and interpret messages.
 Choice d) social interaction can influence media consumption, but it does not directly describe the media-themes model of media influence.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Bowlby's maternal deprivation thesis claimed that: Choices: a) mothers who are living in poverty cannot afford to give their children the resources that other children enjoy b) children deprived of an early,  secure attachment to their mother are prone to suffer physically,  intellectually and socially in later life c) 'mothering' is a socially constructed activity identified in the narratives of new mothers d) deprivation is something children inherit,  usually through their mother's side 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand Bowlby's theory. John Bowlby,  a British psychiatrist,  developed the theory of maternal deprivation in the mid-20th century. His theory focused on the importance of early attachments between children and their mothers.

Next,  we can evaluate the choices given. Choice a) discusses poverty and resources, which is not the main focus of Bowlby's theory. Choice c) refers to 'mothering' as a socially constructed activity, which is not related to Bowlby's theory of maternal deprivation. Choice d) talks about inheritance of deprivation, which is not supported by Bowlby's theory.

This leaves us with choice b), which states that children deprived of an early, secure attachment to their mother are prone to suffer physically, intellectually, and socially in later life. This choice aligns with Bowlby's theory, which posits that the quality of the attachment between a child and their mother during the first years of life has a significant impact on the child's development.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the factors that made war possible between nation states in the nineteenth century.  One factor is the division of the world into several rival overseas empires,  which created competition and conflict.
 Next,  industrialization played a significant role in making war possible.  It provided better transport,  technology,  and administration,  which allowed for more efficient military operations and the expansion of empires.
 Finally,  there was intense economic,  political,  and military competition among nation states,  which drove them to engage in war.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

 First,  I need to identify the criteria of community as defined by Fulcher & Scott.  According to Fulcher & Scott,  a community is characterized by a shared sense of identity and belonging together,  common activities involving all-round relationships,  and collective action based on common interests.
 Next,  I need to compare each choice to the criteria identified by Fulcher & Scott.  Choice a) is a shared sense of identity and belonging together,  which is one of the criteria.  Choice b) is common activities involving all-round relationships,  which is another criterion.  Choice c) is a fixed geographical location,  which is not mentioned as a criterion by Fulcher & Scott.

The consequence of this was: Choices: a) assimilation: all racial boundaries were dissolved by the 'ethnic melting pot' b) multiculturalism: all ethnic identities were celebrated equally c) most ethnic groups were integrated into mainstream society,  but the black population remained in the city's ghettos d) racism: the white host population were hostile and prejudiced towards migrants 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the 'Great Migration'.  It was a period when millions of African Americans moved out of the rural South to urban areas in the North,  primarily between 1916 and 1970.
 Next,  I need to consider the consequences of this migration on Chicago.  The city became more ethnically diverse,  with African Americans,  Europeans,  and other groups moving in.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the given choices in the context of the consequences of the Great Migration.
 a) Assimilation: While some ethnic boundaries were dissolved,  the African American population did not fully assimilate into white society.
 b) Multiculturalism: The celebration of all ethnic identities is not accurate,  as the African American population faced segregation and discrimination.
 c) Integration and ghettos: Most ethnic groups were indeed integrated into mainstream society,  but the African American population remained in the city's ghettos.
 d) Racism: The white host population was indeed hostile and prejudiced towards migrants,  which contributed to the segregation and discrimination faced by the African American population.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the definition of 'authentic' in the context of documents.  According to Scott (1990),  a document is 'authentic' if it meets a specific criterion.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice based on the definition provided.  Choice a) is about the sincerity and accuracy of the account,  but it does not mention anything about being a 'sound' original or reliable copy.  Choice b) is about representing similar documents that did not survive,  which is not related to the authenticity of the document itself.  Choice c) is about having both literal and interpretive meaning,  which is not directly related to the authenticity of the document.

 Output:
 First,  I will analyze each choice to determine which one is not a consequence of global tourism.
 a) decreased rates of prostitution and sex tourism - This is not a direct consequence of global tourism. While it may be a problem in some areas, global tourism itself does not necessarily lead to decreased rates of prostitution and sex tourism.
 b) developing countries can depend on it as a crucial source of income - This is a consequence of global tourism, as it provides income for developing countries.
 c) the exploitation of cheap, unregulated labor in poor countries - This is also a consequence of global tourism, as it can lead to the exploitation of labor in developing countries.
 d) we have become more aware of 'other' societies and ways of living - This is a consequence of global tourism, as it allows people to experience different cultures and ways of life.

"Input: One of the ethical problems with covert participant observation is: Choices: a) not being able to write comprehensive fieldnotes or record conversations b) deceiving the respondents as to the reason for your presence c) observing people outside of their natural setting d) subjecting the participants to physical harm 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider each of the choices and evaluate their relevance to the ethical issues associated with covert participant observation.
 Choice a) not being able to write comprehensive fieldnotes or record conversations,  is not necessarily an ethical problem,  as it depends on the specific circumstances and the methods used to record information.
 Choice b) deceiving the respondents as to the reason for your presence,  is an ethical issue because it violates the principle of honesty and trust between the researcher and the participants.
 Choice c) observing people outside of their natural setting,  is not an ethical problem specific to covert participant observation,  as both covert and overt observation can occur outside of natural settings.
 Choice d) subjecting the participants to physical harm,  is not an ethical problem specific to covert participant observation,  as both covert and overt observation do not typically involve physical harm.

After evaluating each choice,  I can conclude that the ethical problem with covert participant observation is deceiving the respondents as to the reason for your presence.
