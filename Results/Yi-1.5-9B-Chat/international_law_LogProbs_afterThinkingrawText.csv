"Input: Which State ordinarily exercises jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels?  Choices: a) The coastal State b) The flag State c) All States enjoy such jurisdiction d) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the context of the question,  which is about the jurisdiction of states over crimes committed on board vessels.
 Next,  I need to analyze the choices provided.  a) The coastal State refers to the state where the vessel is located,  b) The flag State refers to the state the vessel is registered under,  c) All States enjoy such jurisdiction is not accurate,  as there is a specific state that usually has jurisdiction,  and d) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea is an organization,  not a state.
 To determine the correct answer,  I need to consider the most common practice in international law.  The jurisdiction of states over vessels is typically determined by the flag state,  as it is the state the vessel is registered under.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: What is the meaning of justiciability?  Choices: a) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders b) Justiciability refers to the just nature or cause of a particular right c) Justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular rights conforms to principles of justice d) Justiciability refers to the obligation of a State to enforce a particular Right 
 Output:
 First, let's analyze the given choices and their meanings.
 a) This choice suggests that justiciability is about the ability of rights holders to enforce a particular right through legal channels.
 b) This choice suggests that justiciability is about the fairness or righteousness of a particular right itself.
 c) This choice suggests that justiciability is about the courts' evaluation of whether the non-enforcement of a particular right aligns with principles of justice.
 d) This choice suggests that justiciability is about the legal obligation of a state to enforce a particular right.

Now, let's determine which choice best represents the meaning of justiciability.
Justiciability is primarily concerned with the legal question of whether a case is suitable for judicial review. It is about the practicality and feasibility of a case being brought before the courts, not just the fairness or righteousness of a right, the enforcement by rights holders, or the obligation of a state to enforce a right.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: In what way is Responsibility to Protect (R2 P) different from humanitarian intervention?  Choices: a) R2 P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention b) R2 P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress c) R2 P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis d) R2 P always involves armed force,  whereas humanitarian intervention does not 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the difference between Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and humanitarian intervention.  R2P is a principle that emerged in the 21st century,  focusing on the responsibility of the international community to prevent and stop genocide,  ethnic cleansing,  and mass atrocities.  Humanitarian intervention,  on the other hand,  is a more traditional concept that allows for the use of force to prevent or stop gross violations of human rights.

Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  Choice a suggests that R2P is the same as humanitarian intervention,  which is not true,  as they have different focuses and methods.  Choice b states that R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress,  which is not a defining difference between the two concepts.  Choice c mentions that R2P requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis,  which is a key difference between R2P and humanitarian intervention.  Choice d suggests that R2P always involves armed force,  whereas humanitarian intervention does not,  which is not accurate,  as both concepts can involve armed force.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the nature of the UK Constitution.  It is a legal framework that outlines the structure and principles of the UK's government.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each statement in relation to the UK Constitution.  Statement a) suggests that the sovereign has the only source of power, which is not true, as the UK is a constitutional monarchy with power distributed among different branches of government.
 Statement b) claims that the judiciary can overturn acts of parliament, which is not accurate, as the UK has a parliamentary democracy, and the judiciary does not have the power to overturn acts of parliament.
 Statement c) describes the UK Constitution as uncodified and found in various sources, which is true. The UK Constitution is not a single document but a collection of various sources, including laws, customs, and conventions.
 Statement d) states that the UK Constitution is based on a Bill of Rights, which is partially true. The Bill of Rights is one of the sources of the UK Constitution, but it is not the sole basis.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

This does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes c) It is a peremptory norm of international law and all States have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute d) It is an obligation which concerns solely international courts and tribunals 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the type of obligation the peaceful settlement of disputes is considered.  Is it an obligation of result,  an obligation of conduct,  or something else?
 Next,  I need to consider if this obligation is peremptory,  meaning it is a norm that has the highest rank of obligation,  or if it concerns only specific entities like international courts and tribunals.
 Finally,  I need to evaluate the given choices and determine which one correctly describes the obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes.

After analyzing the choices,  I can conclude that the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the options provided and evaluate their relevance to the principal source of immunity for international organizations (IOs).
 Option a) The UN Charter is a significant document that provides a framework for IOs, but it does not exclusively define the principal source of immunity for IOs.
 Option b) Headquarters agreements and multilateral treaties providing specific immunities are important sources of immunity for IOs, but they are not the sole principal source.
 Option c) Customary law is a general source of international law, but it is not the exclusive principal source of immunity for IOs.

"Input: What is the meaning of proportionality in relation to the options available to the victim State?  Choices: a) The victim State may use the same means and intensity of force as the aggressor b) The victim State may use any means to defeat and incapacitate the aggressor c) The victim State may only use such means and force as it is necessary to defeat the aggressor d) The victim State can do nothing without Security Council approval 
 Output:
 First, let's understand the concept of proportionality in this context. Proportionality refers to the principle that the use of force by a victim state should be in direct relation to the threat posed by the aggressor. This means that the victim state should not use more force than necessary to defeat the aggressor.

Now, let's analyze the options:
a) The victim State may use the same means and intensity of force as the aggressor - This option does not consider the principle of proportionality, as it suggests using the same amount of force, which may be excessive.
b) The victim State may use any means to defeat and incapacitate the aggressor - This option is too broad, as it does not consider the need for proportionality in the use of force.
c) The victim State may only use such means and force as it is necessary to defeat the aggressor - This option aligns with the principle of proportionality, as it suggests using only the necessary means and force to defeat the aggressor.
d) The victim State can do nothing without Security Council approval - This option is not related to the concept of proportionality, as it focuses on the approval process rather than the use of force.

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the purpose of baselines under the law of the sea.  Baselines are used to demarcate the territorial sea,  contiguous zone,  exclusive economic zone,  and internal waters of a coastal State.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice in relation to the purpose of baselines.
 a) While the determination of baselines is used for the measuring of the internal waters of coastal States,  it is not the sole purpose.
 b) The determination of baselines is indeed instrumental to the establishment of all maritime zones,  since they constitute the starting point for measuring the breadth of each zone.  This choice aligns with the purpose of baselines.
 c) The determination of baselines is not directly related to the safe navigation of vessels on the high seas.
 d) Baselines are not only drawn in cases of maritime delimitation between opposing States before an international court or tribunal; they are used for establishing maritime zones in general.

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the main difference between conciliation and mediation.  Both are methods of dispute resolution,  but conciliation involves a neutral third party who helps the parties reach a voluntary agreement,  while mediation also involves a neutral third party but the third party does not have the power to enforce the agreement.
 Next,  I need to find the option that describes this difference.  Option a) states that conciliation produces a binding result,  while mediation does not,  which accurately describes the difference between the two.

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the criteria for requesting an advisory opinion of the ICJ.  The choices provided give different levels of detail,  so I will analyze each one.
 Choice a) states that only the principal organs of the UN may request an advisory opinion.  This includes the Security Council,  General Assembly,  ECOSOC,  Trusteeship Council,  and the Secretariat.
 Choice b) suggests that all international organizations may request an advisory opinion.  This is not accurate,  as the ICJ's advisory jurisdiction is limited to the principal organs of the UN.
 Choice c) provides a more detailed explanation,  stating that the General Assembly and the Security Council may request advisory opinions on any legal question.  Additionally,  'other organs of the United Nations and specialized agencies,  which may at any time be so authorized by the General Assembly,  may also request advisory opinions of the Court on legal questions arising within the scope of their activities'.
 Choice d) combines the criteria from choices a) and c),  stating that the principal organs of the UN may request an advisory opinion as well as the State that have been authorized by the General Assembly.

Choices: a) Its aim is to establish certain offences as universal b) Its aim is to deter the commission of certain international crimes c) Its aim is to provide jurisdiction to all States in respect of particular crimes d) Its aim is to provide jurisdiction to all States in respect of all international crimes 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the purpose of universal jurisdiction. Universal jurisdiction is a legal principle that allows states to exercise jurisdiction over certain individuals for specific crimes, regardless of where the crimes were committed or the nationality of the individuals involved.

Now, let's evaluate the choices:
a) Its aim is to establish certain offences as universal - This choice is partially correct, as universal jurisdiction does involve recognizing certain offenses as universal.
b) Its aim is to deter the commission of certain international crimes - This choice is also partially correct, as one of the effects of universal jurisdiction is to deter the commission of certain international crimes.
c) Its aim is to provide jurisdiction to all States in respect of particular crimes - This choice is more accurate, as it states that universal jurisdiction allows states to have jurisdiction over specific crimes, regardless of the nationality of the individuals or the location of the crime.
d) Its aim is to provide jurisdiction to all States in respect of all international crimes - This choice is not entirely accurate, as universal jurisdiction does not provide jurisdiction over all international crimes; rather, it is limited to specific crimes that are recognized as universal.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Are all acts of State organs attributed to the State under the law international responsibility?  Choices: a) The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State,  even in the case that this conduct was unauthorized or ultra vires b) Only the conduct of the higher echelons of the government of State shall be attributable to it c) The conduct of any State organs shall be considered an act of that State,  provided that it is intra vires d) Only the conduct of the executive branch of the State shall be considered an act of that State.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the question and identify the correct choice.  The question asks if all acts of State organs are attributed to the State under international law.

Next,  I will analyze the choices given:
a) The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State, even in the case that this conduct was unauthorized or ultra vires.
b) Only the conduct of the higher echelons of the government of State shall be attributable to it.
c) The conduct of any State organs shall be considered an act of that State, provided that it is intra vires.
d) Only the conduct of the executive branch of the State shall be considered an act of that State.

Now,  I will determine which choice best answers the question.  The correct answer should state that all acts of State organs are attributed to the State under international law.

Choice a) states that the conduct of any State organ, even unauthorized or ultra vires, is attributed to the State. This choice seems to be the most accurate, as it includes all acts of State organs, regardless of authorization or legality.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: What is a 'treaty' according to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT)?  Choices: a) Treaties are all agreements concluded between States,  international organizations and non-State entities (e. g.  corporations) b) Treaties are agreements concluded between States in written form and governed by international law c) Treaties are both the written and oral agreements between States d) Treaties are agreements concluded between States in written form governed either by international or domestic law 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the definition of a 'treaty' according to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT).  The VCLT defines a treaty as an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law.
 Next,  I will compare this definition to the given choices.  Choice a) includes non-State entities,  which is not mentioned in the VCLT definition.  Choice b) is partially correct,  as it mentions written form and international law,  but it does not mention international organizations and non-State entities.  Choice c) mentions both written and oral agreements,  which is not accurate according to the VCLT.  Choice d) includes domestic law,  which is not mentioned in the VCLT definition.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Is the unlawful homicide committed by Minister of country X abroad an act jure imperii or jure gestionis?  Choices: a) Such conduct is a public act (jure imperii) b) Such conduct never attracts immunity c) Such conduct is a private act (jure gestionis) d) Such conduct is a public act but is shielded by immunity 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the concepts of jure imperii and jure gestionis.  jure imperii refers to acts performed by a sovereign or a state official in the exercise of their public authority,  which are attributable to the state.  jure gestionis,  on the other hand,  refers to acts performed by a sovereign or a state official in their private capacity,  which are not attributable to the state.
 In this case,  the Minister of country X is committing an unlawful homicide abroad.  The act is committed in the exercise of their public authority as a Minister,  so it is attributable to the state.  However,  the act is also unlawful and committed abroad,  which may raise questions about the state's responsibility.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: What was the outcome before the European Court of Human Rights in the Al-Adsani case?  Choices: a) The Court held that the right to a fair trial trumped the privilege of immunity b) The Court held that immunity trumped the right to a fair trial c) The Court held that immunities were not in conflict with the right to a fair trial d) The Court held that human rights considerations prevailed over all other contrary rules of international law,  including most immunities 
 Output:
 First,  I need to recall the outcome of the Al-Adsani case.  The Al-Adsani case involved the arrest of an Iraqi official in Jordan.  The issue at hand was whether the official's immunity from prosecution under international law prevented him from being tried in a national court.
 Next,  I need to consider the options given.  Option a suggests that the right to a fair trial was more important than immunity.  Option b suggests that immunity was more important than the right to a fair trial.  Option c suggests that immunities were not in conflict with the right to a fair trial.  Option d suggests that human rights considerations took precedence over all other rules of international law.
 Finally,  I recall that the European Court of Human Rights ruled that immunities were not in conflict with the right to a fair trial.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: What other criteria were imposed by the Badinter Commission on the former Yugoslav republics?  Choices: a) The Commission required a commitment to submit disputes to the ICJ b) The Commission required a change in boundaries c) The Commission required a commitment to human rights and democracy d) The Commission required an exchange of ethnic populations 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the Badinter Commission.  The Badinter Commission was an international body established in 1991 to determine the borders of the former Yugoslav republics following the dissolution of Yugoslavia.
 Next,  I need to identify the criteria imposed by the Badinter Commission on the former Yugoslav republics.  The Commission focused on criteria that would ensure the stability and security of the region,  as well as respect for human rights and democracy.
 Among the choices provided,  the criteria that were imposed by the Badinter Commission are: a commitment to human rights and democracy (c).
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: How treaties are to be interpreted?  Choices: a) Treaties are to be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose b) Treaties are to be interpreted only in accordance with the ordinary meaning of their terms c) Treaties are to be interpreted in accordance with the intention of the parties,  as evidenced in the preparatory works of the treaty d) Treaties are to be interpreted only in light of its object and purpose 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the general principles of treaty interpretation.  The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides guidelines for interpreting treaties.
 According to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention,  treaties are to be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.
 This means that the correct interpretation should consider the ordinary meaning of the terms,  the context in which they are used,  and the overall purpose of the treaty.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: When coastal States do enforce their criminal jurisdiction over foreign vessels in their ports?  Choices: a) Port States generally do not enforce their criminal jurisdiction over crimes that do not infringe their customs laws or disrupt peace and public order.  b) Port States enforce their jurisdiction in all cases of delinquent vessels c) Port States enforce their jurisdiction only in respect of very serious crimes,  such as drug trafficking d) Port States are not entitled to enforce their jurisdiction over any foreign vessel 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the role of coastal States in enforcing criminal jurisdiction over foreign vessels in their ports.  Coastal States have the authority to enforce their criminal jurisdiction over foreign vessels in their ports, but this authority is subject to certain conditions.
 Next,  we need to consider the choices given and evaluate their accuracy based on the role of coastal States.  Choice a) suggests that Port States generally do not enforce their criminal jurisdiction over crimes that do not infringe their customs laws or disrupt peace and public order, which is a correct statement.  Choice b) claims that Port States enforce their jurisdiction in all cases of delinquent vessels, which is not accurate, as there are certain conditions that must be met.  Choice c) states that Port States enforce their jurisdiction only in respect of very serious crimes, such as drug trafficking, which is not entirely accurate, as Port States may enforce their jurisdiction in other cases as well.  Choice d) claims that Port States are not entitled to enforce their jurisdiction over any foreign vessel, which is not accurate, as Port States do have the authority to enforce their jurisdiction in certain cases.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: What is the value of the Resolutions of the UN General Assembly in terms as a 'source' of international law?  Choices: a) GA Resolutions are considered as additional sources of international law and thus binding upon States b) GA Resolutions are equivalent to treaties c) GA Resolutions reflect always customary law d) GA Resolutions are considered as material source,  in the sense that they may enunciate statements of customary law 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the role of the UN General Assembly (GA) in the context of international law.  The GA is an important forum for States to discuss and adopt resolutions on various issues,  but it does not have the same legal force as treaties or customary law.
 Next,  I need to consider the options provided and evaluate their accuracy in relation to the role of GA resolutions as a source of international law.
 Option a) GA Resolutions are considered as additional sources of international law and thus binding upon States - This is not entirely accurate,  as GA resolutions are not binding upon States.
 Option b) GA Resolutions are equivalent to treaties - This is incorrect,  as GA resolutions do not have the same legal force as treaties.
 Option c) GA Resolutions reflect always customary law - This is not true,  as GA resolutions do not automatically reflect customary law.
 Option d) GA Resolutions are considered as material source,  in the sense that they may enunciate statements of customary law - This option is the closest to the actual role of GA resolutions in the context of international law.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Do treaties bind third States,  ie non-State parties?  Choices: a) Treaties may create only rights for third States b) Treaties create both obligations and rights for third States c) Treaties do no create obligations or rights for third States without their consent d) Treaties do not create any obligations or rights for third States,  even when the latter consent.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the relationship between treaties and third States,  or non-State parties.  Treaties are international agreements that can involve multiple parties,  including countries,  international organizations,  and sometimes non-State actors.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given and their implications.  Choice a suggests that treaties may create rights for third States,  but it does not mention obligations.  Choice b states that treaties create both obligations and rights for third States.  Choice c claims that treaties do not create obligations or rights for third States without their consent.  Choice d suggests that treaties do not create obligations or rights for third States,  even when they consent.
 To determine the correct answer,  I need to consider the general principle that treaties can create obligations and rights for third States,  provided they have some form of consent or recognition.  This is often through formal accession,  partial participation,  or through customary international law.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following articles are not qualified rights?  Choices: a) Article 3  b) Article 8  c) Article 9  d) Article 11  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand which articles are considered qualified rights.  Qualified rights are rights that have certain limitations or conditions attached to them.
 Next,  I need to look at the list of articles provided and determine which ones are known to be qualified rights.  In the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,  Article 3  is about the prohibition of slavery and Article 11  is about the right to freedom of movement,  both of which have conditions attached to them.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a', 'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: What is dualism?  Choices: a) Dualism suggests that international and domestic law are part of a unified legal system b) Under dualism,  international and domestic laws comprise distinct legal Systems c) Dualism suggests that international and domestic law are distinct but equal in hierarchy d) Dualism suggests that international and domestic law are distinct legal systems whereby domestic law always prevails 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what dualism is.  Dualism in the context of law refers to the idea that there are two separate but equal legal systems: international law and domestic law.
 Next,  I need to consider the given choices and find the one that best describes dualism.
 a) This choice suggests that international and domestic law are part of a unified legal system, which is not the case according to dualism.
 b) This choice states that international and domestic laws comprise distinct legal systems, which aligns with the concept of dualism.
 c) This choice suggests that international and domestic law are distinct but equal in hierarchy, which is a possible interpretation of dualism, but it does not capture the full essence of dualism.
 d) This choice suggests that international and domestic law are distinct legal systems, but it adds the condition that domestic law always prevails, which is not a requirement of dualism.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: What is an act jure imperii?  Choices: a) An act is jure imperii when undertaken by an international organisation b) An act is jure imperii when undertaken in an official State capacity c) All acts undertaken by State officials are acts jure imperii d) An act is jure imperii when undertaken by a State corporation 
 Output:
 First, let's understand the term ""jure imperii."" Jure imperii refers to authority or power derived from the state's sovereignty. An act jure imperii is one that is performed by a state or its agents in their official capacity, exercising the sovereign power of the state.

Now, let's evaluate the choices:
a) An act is jure imperii when undertaken by an international organisation - This is incorrect because international organisations do not possess the sovereign power of a state.
b) An act is jure imperii when undertaken in an official State capacity - This is correct because it aligns with the definition of an act jure imperii, where the act is performed by a state or its agents in their official capacity.
c) All acts undertaken by State officials are acts jure imperii - This is not necessarily true because not all acts of state officials are acts jure imperii. It depends on whether the act is performed in an official capacity and exercises sovereign power.
d) An act is jure imperii when undertaken by a State corporation - This is incorrect because state corporations are not the sovereign entities; they act on behalf of the state but do not possess the sovereign power.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: What is the relationship between the formal sources of international law?  Choices: a) There is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law b) Treaties supersede custom c) Custom supersedes treaties d) General Principles of Law supersede both custom and treaties 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the formal sources of international law.  These include treaties,  custom (general practice of states),  general principles of law,  and judicial decisions.
 Next,  I need to consider the relationship between these sources.  There is a hierarchy among the formal sources of international law.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: What was the particular advantage of UNSC Resolution 678  over a collective defensive action under Article 51  UN Charter during the Gulf War?  Choices: a) Resolution 678  allowed the allies to attack Iraq with nuclear and chemical weapons b) Resolution 678  is narrower than the inherent right of self-defence under Article 51  UN Charter c) Resolution 678  was faster to adopt and negotiate.  d) Resolution 678  is broader because it authorised the use of force with respect to any matter threatening the peace and security of the Gulf region.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the difference between UNSC Resolution 678 and Article 51  UN Charter.  UNSC Resolution 678 was adopted in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,  while Article 51  is the inherent right of self-defence for UN member states.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  Choice a) suggests that Resolution 678 allowed the use of nuclear and chemical weapons, which is not true, as the resolution did not authorize the use of such weapons.
 Choice b) states that Resolution 678 is narrower than the inherent right of self-defence under Article 51  UN Charter.  This is incorrect, as Resolution 678 was specifically designed to be a more specific and limited case of self-defence than the general Article 51.
 Choice c) suggests that Resolution 678 was faster to adopt and negotiate.  This is a possible advantage,  but it is not the primary reason why Resolution 678 was used over Article 51.
 Choice d) states that Resolution 678 is broader because it authorized the use of force with respect to any matter threatening the peace and security of the Gulf region.  This is the correct answer, as Resolution 678 was specifically designed to address the specific threat posed by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and its potential broader implications for the peace and security of the Gulf region.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: How can customary law be related to treaty provisions?  Choices: a) Treaties may only codify customary law b) Customary law is a different source of international and it cannot be embodied in treaties c) Treaties may 1 ) codify customary law,  2 ) 'crystallise' customary law,  3 ) lead to the emergence of customary law d) Customary law can emerge only from few multilateral treaties 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the relationship between customary law and treaty provisions.  Customary law is a body of law that is based on the consistent practice of states over a long period of time,  and it can be recognized as binding international law.  Treaties,  on the other hand,  are formal agreements between states that set out specific obligations and commitments.

Next,  I need to consider the choices given and evaluate their validity in relation to the relationship between customary law and treaty provisions.

a) Treaties may only codify customary law - This statement suggests that treaties can only formalize existing customary law,  but it does not address the possibility of treaties creating or crystallizing customary law.

b) Customary law is a different source of international law and it cannot be embodied in treaties - This statement is not entirely accurate,  as treaties can indeed codify or crystallize customary law.

c) Treaties may 1 ) codify customary law,  2 ) 'crystallise' customary law,  3 ) lead to the emergence of customary law - This statement accurately reflects the relationship between customary law and treaty provisions,  as treaties can formalize existing customary law,  create new customary law,  or lead to the crystallization of existing customary practices.

d) Customary law can emerge only from few multilateral treaties - This statement is too restrictive,  as customary law can emerge from a variety of sources,  not just multilateral treaties.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: What does it mean for a State to be sovereign?  Choices: a) Sovereignty means being recognised by all other States b) Sovereignty means to be able to enter into treaties and join the UN c) Sovereignty means freedom to determine one's own affairs without external interference d) Sovereignty means possessing the right to defend oneself 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of sovereignty.  Sovereignty refers to the supreme authority of a state over itself and its territory.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given and see which one best defines sovereignty.  Choice a) refers to recognition by other states, which is a consequence of sovereignty but not the definition.  Choice b) mentions entering into treaties and joining the UN, which are actions that sovereign states can do but are not the definition of sovereignty.  Choice c) describes freedom to determine one's own affairs without external interference, which aligns with the concept of supreme authority over a state and its territory.  Choice d) refers to the right to defend oneself, which is a consequence of sovereignty but not the definition.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: What is the meaning of functional recognition?  Choices: a) Recognition is a function as opposed to a power b) Recognition is reciprocal between two States c) Recognition is only afforded to particular administrative acts not to the entity's declared statehood d) Recognition is only afforded to the government,  not the State 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of functional recognition.  Functional recognition refers to the process by which one state acknowledges the existence and functions of another state,  without necessarily recognizing the latter's declared statehood.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the given choices.  Choice a) is incorrect because it focuses on the nature of recognition as a function rather than its functional aspect.  Choice b) is partially correct but does not capture the essence of functional recognition,  which is not necessarily reciprocal.  Choice c) is partially correct but does not encompass the full scope of functional recognition.  Choice d) is incorrect because it suggests that recognition is only afforded to the government,  not the State.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: What is the meaning of ""act of State"" doctrine?  Choices: a) The act of State doctrine denotes that all State acts attract immunity b) The act of State doctrine denotes that the assessment as to the existence of an alleged tort committed by a State belongs to the executive and not the courts c) The act of State doctrine denotes that the courts are well placed to assess the existence of an alleged tort committed by the State d) The act of State doctrine is a legal mechanism that allows the courts to provide immunity to public acts of foreign States 
 Output:
 First, I will analyze each choice to determine which one accurately defines the ""act of State"" doctrine.

a) This choice suggests that all State acts attract immunity. This is not entirely accurate, as the act of State doctrine applies to specific types of acts, not all State acts.

b) This choice states that the assessment as to the existence of an alleged tort committed by a State belongs to the executive and not the courts. This is closer to the definition, as the act of State doctrine does involve the executive branch in certain cases.

c) This choice suggests that the courts are well placed to assess the existence of an alleged tort committed by the State. This is the opposite of what the act of State doctrine implies, as it typically involves the executive branch making decisions.

d) This choice describes the act of State doctrine as a legal mechanism that allows the courts to provide immunity to public acts of foreign States. This is not accurate, as the act of State doctrine primarily concerns immunity for the acts of a State's own government, not acts of foreign States.

After analyzing each choice, I can conclude that the correct definition of the ""act of State"" doctrine is: b) The act of State doctrine denotes that the assessment as to the existence of an alleged tort committed by a State belongs to the executive and not the courts. Therefore, the answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: How can the structure of the international society be displayed?  Choices: a) The structure of the international society follows the vertical model of the domestic legal orders b) International society consists of a constellation of sovereign States and other international organizations,  which are dispersed in a rather horizontal order of authority c) International society is so anarchical that there is no order of authority,  neither vertical nor horizontal d) The structure of the international society resembles the structure of the most powerful nations in the world 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the structure of the international society.  The international society is made up of sovereign states and international organizations.
 Next,  I need to consider the options given.  Option a) suggests that the international society follows the vertical model of the domestic legal orders,  which is not accurate because the international society does not have a clear hierarchy like domestic legal orders.
 Option b) states that international society consists of a constellation of sovereign states and other international organizations,  which are dispersed in a rather horizontal order of authority.  This option seems to accurately describe the structure of the international society.
 Option c) claims that international society is so anarchical that there is no order of authority,  neither vertical nor horizontal.  While it is true that international society is anarchical, this option does not accurately describe the structure of the international society.
 Option d) suggests that the structure of the international society resembles the structure of the most powerful nations in the world.  This option is not accurate because the structure of the international society is not determined by the most powerful nations.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Are there any limitations to the incorporation of customary crimes under English law?  Choices: a) There are no limitations to the incorporation of customary crimes b) Customary crimes must be contained in a multilateral treaty in order to be automatically incorporated c) The courts may freely incorporate customary crimes into the domestic sphere d) The situation is not clear-cut but an act of parliament would most probably be required 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of customary crimes and how they are incorporated into English law.  Customary crimes are those that are considered to be part of a community's customary law and are recognized as crimes under English law.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given and evaluate their validity in relation to the incorporation of customary crimes.
 a) There are no limitations to the incorporation of customary crimes - This choice suggests that there are no restrictions on the incorporation of customary crimes, which is not entirely accurate. While there may be some cases where customary crimes are automatically incorporated, there are still limitations and considerations involved.
 b) Customary crimes must be contained in a multilateral treaty in order to be automatically incorporated - This choice suggests that for customary crimes to be automatically incorporated, they must be contained in a multilateral treaty. This is not a requirement for automatic incorporation, as customary crimes can be recognized and incorporated without being contained in a treaty.
 c) The courts may freely incorporate customary crimes into the domestic sphere - This choice suggests that the courts have the authority to incorporate customary crimes into the domestic sphere, which is true. The courts have the power to recognize and incorporate customary crimes into English law, but this does not mean that there are no limitations or considerations involved.
 d) The situation is not clear-cut but an act of parliament would most probably be required - This choice acknowledges that the situation is not straightforward and that an act of parliament may be required for the incorporation of certain customary crimes. This is a more accurate representation of the limitations and requirements for the incorporation of customary crimes under English law.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: What is the function of the contiguous zone?  Choices: a) The contiguous zone functions as security zone of the coastal State b) The contiguous zone is a zone,  in which the coastal State may explore and exploit its mineral resources c) The contiguous zone is a zone in which the coastal State is permitted to prevent and punish infringements of customs,  fiscal,  immigration or sanitary laws d) The contiguous zone is a zone in which the coastal State safeguards its archaeological and historical objects

Choices: a) When the applicant is in the custody of the state b) Where the state must investigate claims against it c) The development of a legal framework to protect those within the state d) To provide housing for all those homeless within a state 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify which of the examples has not been developed by the European Court of Human Rights as a situation where the state has a positive obligation to protect.
 The European Court of Human Rights has developed a positive obligation for the state in situations where the applicant is in the custody of the state (a), where the state must investigate claims against it (b), and to provide housing for all those homeless within a state (d).
 The development of a legal framework to protect those within the state (c) is not an example that has been developed by the European Court of Human Rights as a situation where the state has a positive obligation to protect.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which case was the first to define the meaning of the doctrine of 'margin of appreciation' as applied by the European Court of Human Rights?  Choices: a) Goodwin v UK (2002 ) b) Airey v Ireland (1979 ) c) Osman v UK ( 1998 ) d) Handyside v UK (1976 ) 
 Output:
 First, I need to identify the case that introduced the concept of 'margin of appreciation' in the context of the European Court of Human Rights. The doctrine of 'margin of appreciation' refers to the flexibility given to member states to make their own decisions within certain limits, while still respecting the human rights standards set by the court.

Next, I will look at the chronological order of the cases provided: d) Handyside v UK (1976), b) Airey v Ireland (1979), c) Osman v UK (1998), and a) Goodwin v UK (2002).

The first case mentioned is d) Handyside v UK (1976), which was indeed the first case to define the meaning of the doctrine of 'margin of appreciation' as applied by the European Court of Human Rights.

Choices: a) All the members of the arbitral tribunal are appointed by the parties b) All the members of the arbitral tribunal are appointed by the parties c) All the members of the arbitral tribunal are appointed by an impartial third party,  such as the president of the ICJ d) All the members of the arbitral tribunal are appointed by the parties from a restricted list of arbitrators 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the structure of the arbitral tribunal.  An arbitral tribunal is a group of people appointed to hear a dispute and make a decision.
 Next,  I need to consider the options given for appointing the members of the arbitral tribunal.  The options are:
 a) All the members of the arbitral tribunal are appointed by the parties

"Input: Are the peremptory norms of international law the only norms that set out obligations erga omnes?  Choices: a) Yes b) No,  acts of international organizations also set out such obligations c) No,  decisions of international courts also set out such obligations d) No,  even though all peremptory norms set out obligations erga omnes,  the latter may also spring from treaties regulating objective regimes or unilateral acts 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the question.  The question is asking if peremptory norms of international law are the only source of obligations erga omnes,  or obligations that apply to all parties regardless of their membership or participation.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  Choice a) Yes suggests that peremptory norms are the only source.  Choice b) No,  acts of international organizations also set out such obligations suggests that there are other sources,  like acts of international organizations.  Choice c) No,  decisions of international courts also set out such obligations also suggests that there are other sources,  like decisions of international courts.  Choice d) No,  even though all peremptory norms set out obligations erga omnes,  the latter may also spring from treaties regulating objective regimes or unilateral acts suggests that while peremptory norms do set out obligations erga omnes,  there are other sources as well,  like treaties or unilateral acts.
 To answer the question,  I need to consider the definition of peremptory norms and obligations erga omnes.  Peremptory norms are norms that are universally recognized as prohibiting acts that constitute a crime against humanity or a violation of international human rights law.  Obligations erga omnes arise when a norm applies to all states regardless of their adherence to the norm.

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the constitutive theory of recognition.  This theory suggests that statehood is determined by the existence of a state's capacity to enter into relations with other states.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice in the context of the constitutive theory.  a) Recognition is determinative of statehood aligns with the constitutive theory,  as recognition is seen as a key factor in establishing statehood.
 b) Recognition requires constitutional approval by third nations does not align with the constitutive theory,  as it focuses on a specific process of approval rather than the state's capacity to enter into relations.
 c) Recognition requires that the constitution of the recognised State includes sufficient human rights guarantees does not align with the constitutive theory,  as it focuses on the content of the constitution rather than the state's capacity to enter into relations.
 d) Countries wishing to be recognised must possess a valid constitution does not align with the constitutive theory,  as it focuses on the existence of a constitution rather than the state's capacity to enter into relations.

"Input: The enforcement mechanism of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (and Protocol) consists of Choices: a) A reporting mechanism only b) Judgment of an international tribunal c) Right to individual petition only d) A reporting mechanism and right to individual petition 
 Output:
 First,  I need to recall the enforcement mechanism of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).  The ICCPR has two main enforcement mechanisms: a reporting mechanism and a right to individual petition.
 The reporting mechanism allows states to report on their implementation of the Covenant, and the Covenant provides for a review of these reports by the Human Rights Committee.
 The right to individual petition allows individuals to submit complaints to the Human Rights Committee if they believe their rights have been violated.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Is piracy under international (jure gentium) law subject to universal jurisdiction?  Choices: a) Piracy jure gentium is subject to flag State jurisdiction b) Piracy jure gentium is subject to universal jurisdiction c) Piracy jure gentium is subject to port State jurisdiction d) Piracy jure gentium is subject to nationality-based jurisdiction 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the nature of piracy under international law, specifically jure gentium, which refers to offenses considered wrongful by the laws of all nations. Piracy jure gentium includes acts such as robbery, assault, and kidnapping on the high seas.

Next, let's examine the types of jurisdiction mentioned in the choices. Flag State jurisdiction is based on the ship's nationality, Port State jurisdiction is based on the port where the ship is docked, Nationality-based jurisdiction is based on the crew's nationality, and Universal jurisdiction is the power of a state to try and punish a person for a crime committed anywhere in the world, if the crime is considered a crime under the laws of all nations.

Now, considering the nature of piracy jure gentium and the definition of universal jurisdiction, it becomes clear that piracy jure gentium is subject to universal jurisdiction, as it is a crime considered wrongful by the laws of all nations and can be prosecuted by any state, regardless of the ship's flag or the port where the incident occurred.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: What are self-executing treaties?  Choices: a) Self-executing treaties are adopted only by the executive b) Self-executive treaties are clear and precise enough so as not to require any further implementing measures c) Self-executing rely on implementing measures stipulated in the treaty Itself d) Self-executing treaties follow the doctrine of transformation 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what self-executing treaties are.  These are treaties that can be put into effect without the need for additional implementing legislation.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  Choice a) suggests that self-executing treaties are adopted only by the executive,  which is not accurate because they can be adopted by the executive or by the legislature.
 Choice b) states that self-executing treaties are clear and precise enough so as not to require any further implementing measures.  This is a correct description of self-executing treaties.
 Choice c) suggests that self-executing treaties rely on implementing measures stipulated in the treaty itself.  This is not accurate because self-executing treaties do not require additional implementing measures.
 Choice d) states that self-executing treaties follow the doctrine of transformation.  This is not accurate because the doctrine of transformation refers to treaties that are not self-executing and require implementing legislation.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Is the ICJ hostile to the idea that an armed attack may arise through a series of lower intensity,  yet cumulative,  instances of armed force?  Choices: a) The ICJ was not hostile to the accumulation theory b) The concept of an armed attack refers to a single attack,  not multiple smaller instances of armed force c) In the Nicaragua case the ICJ dismissed the accumulation theory d) The ICJ has never addressed this issue 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze the question and identify the key information.  The question is asking whether the ICJ is hostile to the idea that an armed attack may arise through a series of lower intensity,  yet cumulative,  instances of armed force.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the choices given and find the one that best answers the question.
 a) The ICJ was not hostile to the accumulation theory - This choice suggests that the ICJ is not hostile to the accumulation theory,  which means it is open to the idea that an armed attack may arise through multiple instances of lower intensity force.
 b) The concept of an armed attack refers to a single attack,  not multiple smaller instances of armed force - This choice suggests that the ICJ does not consider multiple instances of lower intensity force as an armed attack.
 c) In the Nicaragua case the ICJ dismissed the accumulation theory - This choice suggests that the ICJ specifically dismissed the accumulation theory in the Nicaragua case.
 d) The ICJ has never addressed this issue - This choice suggests that the ICJ has not made a decision on whether it is hostile to the accumulation theory.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Is there any priority among international courts and tribunals?  Choices: a) According to the lis pendens rule,  the court or the tribunal that seizes first the dispute has exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate it b) The International Court of Justice has by definition priority over any other court or tribunal c) Since there is no lis pendens rule in international law and all depends on the consent of the parties to a dispute,  there is no priority or hierarchy among international courts and tribunals d) Regional or special courts have priority over all others in line of the principle of lex specialis 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the question and the choices given.  The question asks if there is any priority among international courts and tribunals.
 Next,  I need to analyze each choice and see which one best answers the question.
 Choice a) talks about the lis pendens rule,  which is a principle in civil law systems that prevents a party from starting a new lawsuit in a court that has already jurisdiction over a similar dispute.  This choice does not directly address the question of priority among international courts and tribunals.
 Choice b) states that the International Court of Justice has by definition priority over any other court or tribunal.  This choice suggests a hierarchy among international courts and tribunals, but it does not consider other courts or the principle of consent of the parties.
 Choice c) explains that there is no lis pendens rule in international law and that the priority among international courts and tribunals depends on the consent of the parties to a dispute.  This choice suggests that there is no fixed hierarchy and that the priority is determined by the agreement of the parties involved.
 Choice d) mentions that regional or special courts have priority over all others in line with the principle of lex specialis, which means the specific law takes precedence over general laws.  This choice suggests a hierarchy among international courts and tribunals, but it does not consider other courts or the principle of consent of the parties.

After analyzing each choice,  I can conclude that choice c) is the best answer,  as it accurately reflects the lack of a fixed hierarchy among international courts and tribunals and the importance of the consent of the parties to a dispute.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Do third States enjoy any fishing rights within the Exclusive Economic Zone of another State?  Choices: a) When the coastal State cannot harvest the 'total allowable catch',  the coastal State is to give other State access to that surplus with priority to be given to developing and land-locked States b) Third States may never have access to fisheries within another State's EEZ c) The coastal State is to give access to fisheries within its EEZ only to neighbouring States d) Third States are free to fish within another EEZ,  except from certain designated areas 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the question.  The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is a zone beyond the territorial sea of a coastal state where the state has sovereign rights to exploit marine resources.
 Next,  I need to consider the fishing rights of third States within the EEZ of another state.  The choices provided give different scenarios.
 Choice a) suggests that when the coastal state cannot harvest the 'total allowable catch',  third States, particularly developing and land-locked States,  may have access to the surplus.
 Choice b) states that third States may never have access to fisheries within another state's EEZ.
 Choice c) suggests that third States can only have access to fisheries within the EEZ of a coastal state if they are neighbouring states.
 Choice d) states that third States are generally free to fish within another EEZ,  with certain designated areas excluded.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: What is the purpose of sovereign immunity?  Choices: a) The purpose of immunity is to protect foreign Heads of State from embarrassment b) Immunity protects a State from being invaded by another c) Immunity shields States from being sued in the courts of other States d) The purpose of immunity is to offer impunity in respect of all crimes 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the concept of sovereign immunity.  Sovereign immunity is a legal principle that protects states from being sued in the courts of other states.
 Next,  we can evaluate the given choices.  Choice a) is partially correct,  as immunity can protect foreign Heads of State from embarrassment,  but it does not focus on the main purpose of immunity.
 Choice b) is related to the protection of a state from invasion,  but this is not the main purpose of sovereign immunity.
 Choice c) directly addresses the main purpose of sovereign immunity,  which is to shield states from being sued in the courts of other states.
 Choice d) suggests that the purpose of immunity is to offer impunity for all crimes,  which is not accurate,  as immunity is not meant to offer impunity for all crimes.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: What is passive personality jurisdiction?  Choices: a) It is jurisdiction based on the nationality of the offender b) It is jurisdiction based on where the offence was committed c) It is jurisdiction based on the nationality of the victims d) It is jurisdiction based on the country where the legal person was Registered 
 Output:
 First, let's understand the concept of passive personality jurisdiction. This type of jurisdiction allows a country to prosecute a person for an offense committed abroad if the person has some connection to the prosecuting country. This connection can be based on the person's nationality, residency, or other legal status.

Now, let's analyze the choices:
a) It is jurisdiction based on the nationality of the offender - This choice suggests that a country can prosecute an individual based on their nationality, regardless of where the offense was committed. This aligns with the concept of passive personality jurisdiction.
b) It is jurisdiction based on where the offence was committed - This choice describes territorial jurisdiction, not passive personality jurisdiction.
c) It is jurisdiction based on the nationality of the victims - This choice describes protective personality jurisdiction, not passive personality jurisdiction.
d) It is jurisdiction based on the country where the legal person was Registered - This choice describes universal jurisdiction in the context of legal persons, not passive personality jurisdiction for individuals.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

 Next,  I will look at the choices provided and determine which type of rights fits this description.  a) Social and economic rights b) Civil and political rights c) Cultural rights d) People's rights.
 Among these choices,  civil and political rights are considered the most basic and fundamental rights, which were established first in the human rights movement.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: What is the problem of 'fragmentation' of international law?  Choices: a) Fragmentation of international law concerns the possibility of different legal regimes apply the same rules of international law b) It is possible for several legal regimes (ie foreign investment law and human rights law) to exist and develop in isolation of each other,  ultimately culminating in the production of divergent rules of international law c) Fragmentation is when States assume different interpretations of the same rule of international law d) Fragmentation is when States disagree to abide by a certain rule of international law 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the problem of 'fragmentation' of international law.  Fragmentation refers to the issue of how different legal regimes or sources of international law interact and potentially conflict with each other.
 Next,  I will consider the given choices and determine which one best describes the problem of fragmentation.
 a) This choice suggests that different legal regimes could apply the same rules of international law, which is not the main issue of fragmentation.
 b) This choice describes the possibility of different legal regimes developing independently, leading to divergent rules of international law, which is a key aspect of the fragmentation problem.
 c) This choice defines fragmentation as different States interpreting the same rule of international law differently, which is related to but not the primary issue of fragmentation.
 d) This choice describes a situation where States disagree on abiding by a certain rule of international law, which is a consequence of fragmentation but not the main issue.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: What is functional (ratione materiae) immunity?  Choices: a) Functional immunity covers the person but not the act b) Functional immunity covers the act and incidentally also the person committing the act c) Functional immunity covers the State and incidentally also the act d) Functional immunity covers both private and public acts as long as they are sanctioned by the State 
 Output:
 First, let's understand the concept of functional immunity. Functional immunity refers to a legal immunity that protects certain entities or actions based on their purpose or function.

Next, let's consider the choices given:
a) Functional immunity covers the person but not the act
b) Functional immunity covers the act and incidentally also the person committing the act
c) Functional immunity covers the State and incidentally also the act
d) Functional immunity covers both private and public acts as long as they are sanctioned by the State

Now, let's analyze each choice:
a) This choice suggests that functional immunity only protects the person and not the act itself, which is not accurate. Functional immunity is based on the function of the act, not the person committing it.
b) This choice implies that functional immunity covers the act but also incidentally covers the person committing the act. This is not the correct understanding of functional immunity, as it is focused on the function of the act, not the individual.
c) This choice states that functional immunity covers the State and incidentally also the act. While it is true that the State may be the subject of functional immunity, the ""incidentally"" part is not accurate, as functional immunity is primarily based on the function of the act, not the entity performing it.
d) This choice correctly states that functional immunity covers both private and public acts as long as they are sanctioned by the State. This is because functional immunity is based on the purpose or function of the act, and acts sanctioned by the State are often considered to serve a public function.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: What is the meaning of implied authorisation?  Choices: a) Presumption of Security Council approval of armed force when a State has been forewarned b) Implicit authorisation on the basis of a specific number of votes by UNSC members c) Presumption that all unlawful attacks will be subject to armed force by a resolution of the UNSC d) In cases of repeated unlawful attacks the UNSC shall authorise neighbouring States to take whatever measures they deem necessary to rectify the situation 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of implied authorisation in the context of international law, particularly in relation to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).
 Implied authorisation refers to a situation where the UNSC, by not taking action to stop an action,  implies that the action is acceptable.  This is different from explicit authorisation,  which requires a specific resolution by the UNSC.
 Now,  I will evaluate each choice in relation to the concept of implied authorisation.
 a) This choice talks about Security Council approval of armed force when a State has been forewarned,  which is not the definition of implied authorisation.
 b) This choice talks about implicit authorisation on the basis of a specific number of votes by UNSC members,  which is not the definition of implied authorisation.
 c) This choice talks about the presumption that all unlawful attacks will be subject to armed force by a resolution of the UNSC,  which is not the definition of implied authorisation.
 d) This choice talks about cases of repeated unlawful attacks where the UNSC authorises neighbouring States to take whatever measures they deem necessary to rectify the situation,  which is an example of implied authorisation.

 Next,  I will check the background of each philosopher to find the one who made this statement.  Alan Gerhold is not known for making such a statement.  Emmanuel Kant did not call natural rights 'nonsense on stilts'.  John Locke did not call natural rights 'nonsense on stilts'.  Jeremy Bentham is known for his criticism of natural rights,  and he did call the idea of natural rights 'nonsense on stilts'.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand who has the authority to conclude a treaty on the part of States.  A treaty is a formal agreement between states,  and it must be concluded in a way that is recognized by international law.
 Next,  I will consider the choices given:
 a) Treaties are concluded by the competent representatives of States.  Heads of States,  heads of governments,  ministers of foreign affairs and heads of diplomatic missions are presumed to have such authority.
 b) Treaties may only negotiated and concluded by the heads of State and ministers of foreign affairs.
 c) Treaties are negotiated and signed only by the persons that bear the necessary 'full powers' and no person is presumed to hold such authority.
 d) Treates are concluded only by members of the diplomatic missions of States.

"Input: Who is a 'persistent objector'?  Choices: a) The State which persistently objects to the rule in question after its formation b) The State which denies to be bound by the rule in question for a short period c) The State which persistently and publicly objects to the formation of a rule of customary law from its outset d) The State which accepts the formation of a rule of customary law but it retains objections as to its content 
 Output:
 First,  let's understand the concept of a 'persistent objector' in the context of international law.  A persistent objector is a state that has a consistent and continuous objection to a rule of customary law.
 Next,  we need to consider the choices given and see which one best fits the definition.  Choice a) describes a state that objects to a rule after its formation, but it doesn't necessarily mean the objection is persistent.
 Choice b) describes a state that denies being bound by a rule for a short period, which doesn't necessarily mean the objection is persistent.
 Choice c) describes a state that persistently and publicly objects to the formation of a rule of customary law from its outset, which aligns with the definition of a persistent objector.
 Choice d) describes a state that accepts the formation of a rule of customary law but retains objections to its content, which doesn't necessarily mean the objection is persistent.

"Input: What is the meaning of collective security?  Choices: a) The right to self-defence by more than one nation acting in concert b) The right of one's allies to defend the victim State c) The authorisation of armed force by the UN Security Council d) The authorisation of peacekeeping missions by the UN General Assembly 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of collective security.  Collective security refers to a principle of international law and international relations that holds that nations should act together to maintain security,  protecting each other from external threats.
 Next,  I will examine the choices given.  Choice a) refers to the right of nations to defend themselves collectively,  which is related to collective security.  Choice b) refers to the right of allies to defend the victim state,  which is a specific aspect of collective security but not the general concept itself.  Choice c) refers to the authorisation of armed force by the UN Security Council,  which is a mechanism for implementing collective security.  Choice d) refers to the authorisation of peacekeeping missions by the UN General Assembly,  which is another mechanism for implementing collective security.
 The meaning of collective security is the general principle of nations acting together to maintain security,  so the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

 First,  I need to identify the main focus of the European Convention on Human Rights.  This convention is a set of international treaties that establish the civil and political rights that all European Union member states must respect.
 Next,  I will compare this focus with the given choices.  a) Economic and social rights, b) Environmental rights, c) Civil and political rights, and d) Economic freedom.
 The European Convention on Human Rights primarily deals with civil and political rights, which aligns with choice c).
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Is the jurisdiction of international tribunals regulated by the same principles applicable to national courts?  Choices: a) The jurisdictional principles applicable to national courts are also common to international tribunals b) The jurisdiction of all international tribunals is regulated by the UN Security Council c) International tribunals share some,  but not all,  of the jurisdictional principles applicable to national courts d) The jurisdiction of international tribunals is dictated solely by their founding treaties 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the relationship between international tribunals and national courts in terms of jurisdiction.  Both types of courts have jurisdiction over specific legal matters,  and their powers are defined by the laws and treaties that establish them.
 Next,  I need to consider the role of the UN Security Council in regulating the jurisdiction of international tribunals.  While the Security Council has the authority to make recommendations regarding the jurisdiction of international tribunals,  it does not have the exclusive power to regulate their jurisdiction.
 Now,  I need to consider the extent to which international tribunals share jurisdictional principles with national courts.  While there may be some overlap,  it is not accurate to say that all international tribunals share the exact same jurisdictional principles as national courts.
 Finally,  I need to consider the role of founding treaties in defining the jurisdiction of international tribunals.  The jurisdiction of many international tribunals is indeed defined by their founding treaties,  but this is not true for all international tribunals.
 Based on these considerations,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: What is the meaning of collective rights?  Choices: a) Collective rights belong to distinct groups of people b) Collective rights are those that belong to particular groups as opposed to the individual members of the group c) Minority rights are collective rights d) Collective rights entail a right of the group as such as well as individual rights of the group's members 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of collective rights.  Collective rights refer to rights that belong to distinct groups of people rather than to individual members of the group.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  Choice a) states that collective rights belong to distinct groups of people, which aligns with the definition.  Choice b) suggests that collective rights are those that belong to particular groups as opposed to individual members, which also aligns with the definition.  Choice c) defines minority rights as collective rights, which is not the same as the definition of collective rights.  Choice d) mentions that collective rights entail a right of the group as such as well as individual rights of the group's members, which is a more detailed explanation of collective rights but does not capture the essence of the concept.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Are States under any obligation when they conduct negotiations?  Choices: a) States are under no obligation as to how they conduct their negotiation b) States are under an obligation so to conduct themselves that the negotiations are meaningful c) States are under an obligation to find a solution of the dispute whenever they conduct negotiations d) States are under an obligation to inform the UN Secretary-General about the progress of their negotiations 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the question.  The question is asking about the obligation of states when they conduct negotiations.
 Next,  we need to consider the choices given.  Choice a) suggests that states have no obligation in how they conduct their negotiations.  Choice b) suggests that states have an obligation to conduct themselves in a way that the negotiations are meaningful.  Choice c) suggests that states have an obligation to find a solution to the dispute during negotiations.  Choice d) suggests that states have an obligation to inform the UN Secretary-General about the progress of their negotiations.
 To find the correct answer,  we need to consider the nature of negotiations.  Negotiations are meant to be a process of dialogue and discussion between states to reach a mutual understanding or agreement.  Therefore,  it is reasonable to say that states have an obligation to conduct themselves in a way that the negotiations are meaningful,  as this is the purpose of the negotiation process.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: What is the major difference between naturalism and positivism?  Choices: a) On the one hand,  naturalism is based on a set of rules that are of universal and objective scope and on the other hand,  positivism is based on a structured and coherent legal system that is created by States in light of their interests and desires b) While naturalism serves only the theory human rights law,  positivism has a wider and more general scope c) Naturalism concerns the underpinning values of the international society,  while positivism the international rules as such d) Naturalism is a school of thought advocated outside of Europe,  while positivism is Euro-centric theory 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the key concepts of naturalism and positivism.  Naturalism is a legal philosophy that emphasizes the universality and objectivity of human rights,  arguing that certain rights are inherent and inalienable to all human beings.  Positivism,  on the other hand,  is a legal philosophy that focuses on the role of state sovereignty and the creation of legal norms through treaties and other international agreements.
 Now,  I need to compare the two concepts and identify the major difference.  Option a) suggests that naturalism is based on a set of rules that are of universal and objective scope,  while positivism is based on a structured and coherent legal system created by states in light of their interests and desires.  This option accurately captures the main difference between the two philosophies.

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of 'internationally wrongful conduct'.  This term refers to a situation where a State is found to have violated an international obligation.
 Next,  I will analyze the given choices to find the correct definition.
 a) This choice focuses on actions or omissions that breach international criminal law, which is a subset of international obligations.
 b) This choice is too broad,  as it includes every breach of an international obligation,  whether attributable to the State or not.
 c) This choice accurately defines internationally wrongful conduct as an action or omission attributable to the State,  which constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.
 d) This choice focuses on conduct that cannot be excused,  which is related to internationally wrongful conduct but does not fully define it.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: What is the effects doctrine?  Choices: a) It posits that jurisdiction exists only when it is effective b) The effects doctrine serves to confer jurisdiction on the State which has an effective link with the harmful conduct c) The effects doctrine serves to confer jurisdiction on the State sharing the nationality of the offender d) The effects doctrine serves to confer jurisdiction to the State on whose territory the conduct produces effects 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what the effects doctrine is.  The effects doctrine is a principle in international law that determines the jurisdiction of a state over an individual based on the effects of the individual's conduct on the state's territory.
 Next,  I need to compare the given choices to the definition of the effects doctrine.  Choice a) states that jurisdiction exists only when it is effective,  which is not the full definition of the effects doctrine.  Choice b) confers jurisdiction on the state with an effective link with the harmful conduct,  which is not specifically about the effects on the state's territory.  Choice c) confers jurisdiction on the state sharing the nationality of the offender,  which is related to the nationality doctrine,  not the effects doctrine.
 Finally,  choice d) states that the effects doctrine serves to confer jurisdiction to the state whose territory the conduct produces effects.  This aligns with the definition of the effects doctrine,  which determines jurisdiction based on the effects of the conduct on the state's territory.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which persons are considered as 'de facto' organs of the State under the law of international responsibility?  Choices: a) 'De facto organs' are the individuals that are empowered by law to exercise elements of governmental authority b) 'De facto organs' are the persons,  which are,  in fact,  acting on the instructions of,  or under the direction or control of,  that State in carrying out the conduct attributable to the State c) 'De facto organs' are the de jure organs of the State that act without due authority or ultra vires d) 'De facto organs' are the organs,  whose acts or omission cannot be attributed to the State 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of 'de facto' organs of the State under the law of international responsibility.  'De facto' organs refer to entities or individuals that,  in fact,  exercise governmental authority or act on behalf of a State.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice based on this understanding.
 a) This choice describes 'de jure' organs,  not 'de facto' organs,  as they are empowered by law to exercise governmental authority.
 b) This choice accurately describes 'de facto' organs,  as they are persons acting on the instructions of,  or under the direction or control of,  the State in carrying out the conduct attributable to the State.
 c) This choice describes 'de jure' organs that act without due authority or ultra vires,  not 'de facto' organs.
 d) This choice describes 'de jure' organs whose acts or omissions cannot be attributed to the State,  not 'de facto' organs.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: What is the fundamental prerequisite for the incorporation of custom under English law?  Choices: a) Custom is incorporated if it is not in conflict with existing legislation b) Custom is superior to English law and is always incorporated c) Custom must first be recognised by Parliament before the courts can bring it into the domestic sphere d) Custom is incorporated with the passing of implementing legislation 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the concept of custom under English law.  Custom refers to a practice that has been followed for a long time and is generally accepted by the community.
 Next,  we need to consider the options given.  Option a suggests that custom is incorporated if it is not in conflict with existing legislation.  This makes sense because custom should not undermine existing laws.
 Option b states that custom is superior to English law and is always incorporated.  This is not true because custom cannot override existing laws.
 Option c says that custom must first be recognised by Parliament before the courts can bring it into the domestic sphere.  This is also not accurate because custom can be recognized by the courts without Parliament's involvement.
 Option d suggests that custom is incorporated with the passing of implementing legislation.  This is not correct because custom can be incorporated without the need for new legislation.

After analyzing the options,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Was the use of armed force permitted prior to the United Nations Charter?  Choices: a) Armed force was prohibited b) Armed force was permitted with no restrictions c) Armed force was permitted subject to few restrictions d) Armed force was not regulated under international law prior to 1945  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the United Nations Charter.  The Charter,  which came into effect in 1945,  established the United Nations and outlined the principles and methods for maintaining international peace and security.
 Next,  I need to understand the provisions of the Charter regarding the use of armed force.  The Charter allows the use of armed force only under specific conditions,  such as when authorized by the Security Council.

"Input: What is the 'equitable result' in the law and practice of maritime delimitation?  Choices: a) It is the only method of delimitation that international courts and tribunals follow b) An equitable result is what a judge or the arbitrator would decide ex aequo et bono,  i. e.  upon their discretion and in light of what they consider as fair and equitable in a delimitation case c) It is the end result that all delimitations of areas of continental shelf and EEZ should achieve,  after,  however,  drawing a provisional 'equidistance line' and adjusting the zone in the light of the relevant circumstances and the proportionality test.  d) Achieving an equitable result is an old method of delimitation which is currently not applicable 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of 'equitable result' in the context of maritime delimitation.  Maritime delimitation refers to the process of dividing the sea areas,  such as the continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone (EEZ),  between two or more coastal states.
 The 'equitable result' refers to a fair and equitable division of the sea areas,  considering the relevant circumstances and proportionality.
 Now,  I will analyze the given choices:
 a) This choice states that equitable result is the only method of delimitation followed by international courts and tribunals.  This is not accurate,  as there are other methods,  such as equidistance and median line,  that are also used.
 b) This choice describes the equitable result as what a judge or arbitrator decides based on their discretion and considering what is fair and equitable.  This is a correct description of the equitable result in maritime delimitation.
 c) This choice states that the equitable result is the end goal of all delimitations,  after drawing a provisional equidistance line and adjusting the zone based on relevant circumstances and the proportionality test.  This choice accurately describes the process of achieving an equitable result in maritime delimitation.
 d) This choice claims that achieving an equitable result is an old method of delimitation that is not applicable today.  This is not accurate,  as the equitable result is still an important consideration in maritime delimitation cases.

After analyzing the choices,  I can conclude that the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: What is a derogation?  Choices: a) Derogations are exemptions from particular human rights obligations contained in a treaty b) A derogation refers to the ability of rights holders to bring a claim against the State for breach of an obligation c) A State may suspend particular rights by means of a derogation in circumstances that threaten its existence d) Derogations are enforcement clauses in human rights treaties 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the term 'derogation' in the context of human rights treaties.  A derogation is a temporary suspension of certain rights or obligations under a treaty.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice based on this definition.
 a) Derogations are exemptions from particular human rights obligations contained in a treaty - This choice is partially correct, as derogations can be exemptions, but they are not just exemptions; they are suspensions of rights.
 b) A derrogation refers to the ability of rights holders to bring a claim against the State for breach of an obligation - This choice is incorrect, as a derogation is not about bringing a claim; it is about suspending rights.
 c) A State may suspend particular rights by means of a derogation in circumstances that threaten its existence - This choice is correct, as it describes a situation where a derogation can be used, which is when certain rights are temporarily suspended.
 d) Derogations are enforcement clauses in human rights treaties - This choice is incorrect, as derogations are not enforcement clauses; they are suspensions of rights or obligations.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: What is an act jure gestionis?  Choices: a) Acts jure gestionis are those undertaken by States in a private capacity b) All purchases by the State are acts jure gestionis c) All acts undertaken by State corporations are jure gestionis d) All conduct undertaken by government officials in their free time is considered jus gestionis.  
 Output:
 First, let's understand the term ""act jure gestionis."" It refers to actions taken by a state in the context of its administration or governance.

Next, let's evaluate each choice:
a) Acts jure gestionis are those undertaken by States in a private capacity - This statement is incorrect because states do not act in a private capacity; they act on behalf of the public.
b) All purchases by the State are acts jure gestionis - This statement is too broad and does not necessarily imply that all purchases are acts of governance.
c) All acts undertaken by State corporations are jure gestionis - This statement is closer to the definition, as state corporations are typically involved in the administration or governance of the state.
d) All conduct undertaken by government officials in their free time is considered jus gestionis - This statement is incorrect because the term ""act jure gestionis"" refers to actions taken during the official capacity of government officials, not their personal time.

Based on the analysis, the most accurate definition of an act jure gestionis is found in choice c) All acts undertaken by State corporations are jure gestionis.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 Output:
 First, I need to understand the concept of cultural relativism. Cultural relativism is the idea that what is considered right or wrong, good or bad, is relative to the culture in which it occurs. It emphasizes the importance of understanding and respecting cultural differences.

Next, I will analyze each choice to see which one best represents the concept of cultural relativism.

a) Culture relativism posits that human rights apply equally to all without restrictions - This choice suggests that cultural relativism implies a universal application of human rights, which is not accurate because cultural relativism acknowledges the importance of cultural differences.

b) Culture relativism posits that human rights have a cultural origin - This choice is partially correct, as human rights are indeed influenced by culture, but it does not capture the essence of cultural relativism, which is about understanding and respecting cultural differences.

c) Cultural relativism posits that the application of human rights is relative to the laws in each nation - This choice is the closest to the actual concept of cultural relativism, as it acknowledges that the application of human rights can vary based on the laws and cultural norms of each nation.

d) Cultural relativism posits that local culture should validate the existence and practice of all human rights - This choice is not accurate, as cultural relativism does not validate the existence and practice of all human rights; rather, it emphasizes the importance of understanding and respecting cultural differences in the context of human rights.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 Output:
 First, I need to understand the scope of the ECHR. The ECHR, or European Convention on Human Rights, primarily applies to member states within the European Union.

Next, I need to consider the circumstances under which the ECHR might extend its jurisdiction outside Europe. The correct answer is b) The ECHR applies extraterritorially in circumstances where a member State exercises effective control. This means that if a member state is responsible for human rights violations outside its traditional territory, the ECHR may still apply.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

"Input: What was the consequence from the absence of implementing legislation in the Tin Council case?  Choices: a) The International Tin Council was headquartered in London and hence the absence of implementing legislation was inconsequential b) The constitutive treaties of international organisations are subject to the doctrine of incorporation c) The absence of implementing legislation with respect to the Council's founding treaty meant that individuals did not derive rights and duties from it in the English legal system d) The absence of implementing legislation in England in respect of an international organisation is inconsequential under international law 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the context of the Tin Council case. The Tin Council is an international organization responsible for regulating the tin industry. The absence of implementing legislation in England is the main issue we need to address.

Next, let's analyze the choices provided:

a) This choice suggests that the location of the International Tin Council's headquarters in London made the absence of implementing legislation inconsequential. This is not necessarily true, as the location of the headquarters does not determine the legal consequences of not implementing legislation in a specific country.

b) This choice discusses the constitutive treaties of international organizations and the doctrine of incorporation, which is not directly related to the absence of implementing legislation in the Tin Council case.

c) This choice correctly addresses the issue by stating that the absence of implementing legislation with respect to the Council's founding treaty meant that individuals did not derive rights and duties from it in the English legal system. This is a plausible consequence of not implementing legislation.

d) This choice suggests that the absence of implementing legislation in England in respect of an international organization is inconsequential under international law. However, this statement does not necessarily hold true in all cases, as the consequences of not implementing legislation can vary depending on the specific circumstances and the nature of the international organization.

Based on the analysis, the most accurate consequence of the absence of implementing legislation in the Tin Council case is choice c) The absence of implementing legislation with respect to the Council's founding treaty meant that individuals did not derive rights and duties from it in the English legal system.

"Input: What is 'unilateral acts'?  Choices: a) They are acts that States perform as practice in the context of custom b) They are acts creating unilateral legal obligations to the acting State c) Unilateral acts are simply political acts of State devoid of any legal effect d) Unilateral acts are those that State perform in order to be bound by a treaty 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the definition of 'unilateral acts'. Unilateral acts refer to actions taken by a State that create legal obligations for that State without the need for consent from other States.

Next, let's evaluate each choice:
a) They are acts that States perform as practice in the context of custom - This choice is not accurate because unilateral acts create legal obligations, not just customary practices.
b) They are acts creating unilateral legal obligations to the acting State - This choice aligns with the definition of unilateral acts, as it states that they create legal obligations for the State performing the act.
c) Unilateral acts are simply political acts of State devoid of any legal effect - This choice is incorrect because unilateral acts do have legal effect, creating obligations for the State.
d) Unilateral acts are those that State perform in order to be bound by a treaty - This choice is not entirely accurate because unilateral acts can be performed to create obligations for the State, not just to be bound by a treaty.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

Choices: a) Such abduction constitutes abuse of process and leads to a stay of proceedings b) Such abduction gives rise to the abductor's liability but does not lead to a stay of proceedings c) The stay of proceedings under such circumstances would prevent the administration of justice in respect of international criminals d) The courts may,  but will seldom,  stay proceedings in cases of extra-territorial abduction 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of extra-territorial abduction and its implications on jurisdiction.  Extra-territorial abduction refers to the abduction of a person across borders,  with the intention of interfering with the legal process in another jurisdiction.
 Next,  I need to consider the grounds for refusal of jurisdiction by English courts.  One such ground is the abuse of process,  where the abduction is used to frustrate the proper administration of justice.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  Choice a) states that such abduction constitutes abuse of process and leads to a stay of proceedings,  which aligns with the concept of abuse of process.  Choice b) suggests that such abduction gives rise to the abductor's liability but does not lead to a stay of proceedings,  which does not align with the abuse of process ground.  Choice c) discusses the stay of proceedings under such circumstances and its impact on international criminals,  but does not specifically mention the abuse of process ground.  Choice d) mentions that the courts may,  but will seldom,  stay proceedings in cases of extra-territorial abduction,  which is not as definitive as choice a).

"Input: What is the meaning of 'secondary rules' in the law of international responsibility?  Choices: a) Secondary rules are the rules of interpretation of international law,  including the law of international responsibility b) Secondary rules are the rules that govern the legal consequences arising from a breach of the primary rules,  ie of the international obligations of the States c) Secondary rules are the rules that govern exclusively the concept of attribution in the law of international responsibility d) Secondary rules are the rules that govern exclusively the law of countermeasures 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of 'secondary rules' in the context of the law of international responsibility.  The law of international responsibility is based on a hierarchy of rules,  with primary rules being the obligations that States have under international law,  and secondary rules governing how these obligations are to be fulfilled.
 Next,  I need to consider each of the given choices and determine which one accurately describes the meaning of 'secondary rules'.
 a) Secondary rules are the rules of interpretation of international law,  including the law of international responsibility - This choice is partially correct,  as the rules of interpretation are indeed part of the secondary rules,  but they are not the only ones.
 b) Secondary rules are the rules that govern the legal consequences arising from a breach of the primary rules,  ie of the international obligations of the States - This choice accurately describes the meaning of 'secondary rules',  as they are the rules that provide the legal framework for the consequences of a breach of primary rules.
 c) Secondary rules are the rules that govern exclusively the concept of attribution in the law of international responsibility - This choice is not entirely accurate,  as attribution is one aspect of the secondary rules,  but not the exclusive one.

 Output:
 First, let's consider the doctrine of incorporation in the context of treaties. The doctrine of incorporation refers to the process by which international treaties are integrated into the domestic legal system of a country.

Next, let's evaluate each choice in relation to the doctrine of incorporation.

a) This choice suggests that all treaties must undergo legislative transformation before becoming domestic law. While some transformation may be required, this choice implies that it is a mandatory requirement, which is not accurate.

b) This choice states that the doctrine of incorporation does not require any further action at the domestic level. This is not true, as some form of incorporation is necessary to integrate treaties into the domestic legal system.

c) This choice suggests that treaties are inferior to domestic law. The doctrine of incorporation does not inherently treat treaties as inferior; rather, it aims to integrate them into the domestic legal framework.

d) This choice suggests that ratified treaties automatically pass into the sphere of domestic law. This is closer to the truth, as the doctrine of incorporation does aim to incorporate ratified treaties into the domestic legal system.

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the relevant provision of the State regarding provisional measures.  According to the literal interpretation of the relevant provision,  provisional measures are not binding.
 Next,  I need to consider whether the parties have agreed to binding provisional measures beforehand.  There is no mention of such an agreement in the input.

"Input: When are countermeasures illegal?  Choices: a) Countermeasures are illegal when inter alia are disproportionate or in violation of a peremptory norm of international law (e. g.  the use of force,  human rights) b) Countermeasures are illegal when they are taken in the course of an armed conflict c) Countermeasures are illegal when they violate bilateral treaties d) Countermeasures are illegal when the responsible State does not consent to them 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand when countermeasures are considered illegal.  Countermeasures are actions taken by one party to respond to another party's actions or inactions.
 Next,  I need to consider the conditions under which countermeasures are considered illegal.  According to international law,  countermeasures are illegal when they are disproportionate or in violation of a peremptory norm of international law (e. g.  the use of force,  human rights).
 The other options provided do not accurately represent when countermeasures are considered illegal.  Option b) is incorrect because countermeasures can be used in the course of an armed conflict,  as long as they are proportionate and not in violation of peremptory norms.  Option c) is incorrect because countermeasures can be used even if they violate bilateral treaties,  as long as they are proportionate and not in violation of peremptory norms.  Option d) is incorrect because the consent of the responsible State is not a requirement for countermeasures to be legal,  as long as they are proportionate and not in violation of peremptory norms.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: What is the difference between political and legal means of dispute settlement?  Choices: a) The outcome arising from legal methods,  ie arbitration or adjudication by the ICJ,  is final and binding upon the parties,  whereas this is not the case with diplomatic methods b) The political methods are pursued upon the consent of then parties to the dispute,  whereas the legal methods not c) The political means lead to a final settlement of the dispute,  whereas this is not the case with the legal methods d) The legal methods of dispute settlement are pursued only in respect of significant disputes,  whereas the political means are employed in all disputes 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the difference between political and legal means of dispute settlement.  Political methods include diplomacy,  negotiation,  and other forms of communication between states to reach a resolution.  Legal methods involve the use of international law and institutions,  such as the ICJ,  to resolve disputes.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice in relation to the difference between the two methods.
 a) This choice states that legal methods have a final and binding outcome,  whereas this is not the case with diplomatic methods.  This is a valid difference between the two methods.
 b) This choice states that political methods are pursued with the consent of the parties,  whereas legal methods are not.  This is not a valid difference,  as both methods require the consent of the parties to the dispute.
 c) This choice states that political means lead to a final settlement,  whereas this is not the case with legal methods.  This is not a valid difference,  as both methods can lead to a final settlement.
 d) This choice states that legal methods are pursued only in significant disputes,  whereas political means are employed in all disputes.  This is not a valid difference,  as both methods can be used in all types of disputes.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: What is the rationale for the exhaustion of local remedies in international human rights?  Choices: a) The local remedies rule aims to free up international tribunals to deal with the most serious cases b) The local remedies rule aims to dissuade applicants abusing the system from filing unnecessary petitions c) The local remedies rule aims on the one hand to restrict the volume of petitions to international tribunals while at the same time building up the capacity of local courts d) The local remedies rule helps demonstrate that national courts are always better placed than international ones to deal with cases 
 Output:
 First, I need to understand the rationale behind the exhaustion of local remedies in the context of international human rights. The exhaustion of local remedies is a principle that requires individuals to exhaust all available local remedies before bringing a case to an international court or tribunal.

Next, I will consider each of the given choices and evaluate their relevance to the rationale for this rule.

a) This choice suggests that the rule is meant to focus international tribunals on the most serious cases. While this could be a secondary effect, it is not the primary rationale for the exhaustion of local remedies.

b) This choice suggests that the rule is meant to prevent abuse of the system by discouraging unnecessary petitions. This is a plausible rationale, as it helps maintain the integrity of the international human rights system by ensuring that cases are brought to international courts only after local remedies have been exhausted.

c) This choice combines two aspects: restricting the volume of petitions to international tribunals and building up the capacity of local courts. This choice seems to encompass the primary rationale for the exhaustion of local remedies, as it addresses both the volume of cases and the development of local judicial systems.

d) This choice suggests that the rule is meant to prove that national courts are always better positioned than international ones to handle cases. This is not a valid rationale, as the exhaustion of local remedies does not imply that national courts are always better; rather, it is a procedural requirement before cases are considered by international courts.

After evaluating each choice, the most comprehensive rationale for the exhaustion of local remedies in international human rights is the combination of aspects mentioned in choice c). Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following cases best illustrates the 'living instrument principle' used by the European Court of Human Rights?  Choices: a) Golder v UK (1978 ) b) A v UK (2009 ) c) Goodwin v UK (2002 ) d) Osman v UK (1998 ) 
 Output:
 First, let's understand the 'living instrument principle'. This principle means that the European Court of Human Rights interprets and applies the European Convention on Human Rights in a way that is flexible and responsive to changing circumstances and values.

Now, let's analyze each case:

a) Golder v UK (1978) - This case involved the right to protest and the use of anti-democratic practices by the government. The court applied the Convention in a way that respected the principles of democracy and freedom of expression.

b) A v UK (2009) - This case involved the right to marry and the recognition of same-sex partnerships. The court recognized the right to marry irrespective of sexual orientation, showing a flexible approach to the Convention.

c) Goodwin v UK (2002) - This case involved the right to freedom of expression and the use of hate speech. The court applied the Convention in a way that respected the principle of free speech while protecting individuals from harm.

d) Osman v UK (1998) - This case involved the right to life and the use of excessive force by the police. The court applied the Convention in a way that respected the principle of the prohibition of torture and inhuman treatment.

The case that best illustrates the 'living instrument principle' is A v UK (2009), as it shows the court's ability to adapt the Convention to changing circumstances and values. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Is the recognition of foreign judgments subject to the same rules as those applicable to the incorporation and transformation of treaties?  Choices: a) Foreign judgments are enforced on the basis of the doctrine of incorporation b) Foreign judgments are enforced on the basis of the doctrine of transformation c) The recognition of foreign judgments is dependent on the existence of appropriate bilateral or multilateral treaties d) The courts exercise discretion as to the enforcement of foreign judgments on the basis of the rule of comity 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the relationship between the recognition of foreign judgments and the incorporation and transformation of treaties.  The doctrine of incorporation refers to the process of incorporating a foreign judgment into the domestic legal system, while the doctrine of transformation refers to the process of transforming a foreign judgment into a domestic judgment.
 The question is asking if the recognition of foreign judgments follows the same rules as those applicable to the incorporation and transformation of treaties.  Choice a) suggests that foreign judgments are enforced through incorporation, choice b) suggests that they are enforced through transformation, and choice c) suggests that recognition depends on bilateral or multilateral treaties.
 Choice d) suggests that courts exercise discretion based on the rule of comity.  This option does not directly relate to the incorporation or transformation of treaties.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: What was the most important finding by the House of Lords in the Pinochet case?  Choices: a) The Pinochet case confirmed that former heads of State enjoy absolute immunity b) The Pinochet case confirmed that all public acts enjoy immunity c) The Pinochet case confirmed that former heads of State cease to enjoy personal immunity once removed from office d) The Pinochet case confirmed that in respect of immunities there is no difference between a current and a former head of State 
 Output:
 First, I need to identify the key subject of the question, which is the most important finding by the House of Lords in the Pinochet case.
 Next, I need to analyze each choice and determine which one aligns with the most important finding.
 a) The Pinochet case confirmed that former heads of State enjoy absolute immunity - This choice suggests that former heads of state have immunity without any limitations, which is not the most important finding.
 b) The Pinochet case confirmed that all public acts enjoy immunity - This choice is not relevant to the most important finding, as it does not address the immunity of former heads of state.
 c) The Pinochet case confirmed that former heads of State cease to enjoy personal immunity once removed from office - This choice aligns with the most important finding, as it states that former heads of state lose their immunity once they are no longer in power.
 d) The Pinochet case confirmed that in respect of immunities there is no difference between a current and a former head of State - This choice contradicts the most important finding, as it suggests that there is no difference in immunity between current and former heads of state.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which one of the statements below is false?  Choices: a) The war crimes trials at Nuremberg and Tokyo took place immediately after the First World War b) The war crimes trials introduced a 'crime against humanity' as an offence c) The war crimes trials held individuals legally responsible for acts such as war crimes and crimes against humanity d) The war crimes trials found that ""superior orders"" could not be used as a defence for war crimes or crimes against humanity 
 Output:
 First,  I will go through each statement and evaluate its truthfulness.
 a) The war crimes trials at Nuremberg and Tokyo took place immediately after the First World War.  This statement is false.  The Nuremberg trials took place after World War II, not World War I.

 c) The war crimes trials held individuals legally responsible for acts such as war crimes and crimes against humanity.  This statement is true.  The trials did hold individuals responsible for these crimes.
 d) The war crimes trials found that ""superior orders"" could not be used as a defence for war crimes or crimes against humanity.  This statement is true.  The trials did not allow ""superior orders"" as a defense for these crimes.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which State exercises jurisdiction over vessels on the high seas?  Choices: a) All States may exercise jurisdiction over foreign vessels on the high seas b) States may exercise jurisdiction over foreign vessels on the high seas only in cases of criminal activity that concerns them c) The flag State is to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over its vessels on the high seas,  with the exception of specific cases,  such as piracy d) The flag State is the only State to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over its vessels on the high seas with no exception 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of jurisdiction over vessels on the high seas.  Jurisdiction refers to the authority of a state to exercise legal power over a particular territory or subject.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given and their implications.  Choice a suggests that all states have jurisdiction over foreign vessels, which is not accurate as there are specific rules governing this.
 Choice b suggests that states can only exercise jurisdiction over foreign vessels in cases of criminal activity, which is also not entirely accurate as there are other circumstances where jurisdiction can be exercised.
 Choice c states that the flag state has exclusive jurisdiction over its vessels on the high seas, with exceptions such as piracy. This is a more accurate representation of the current international law.
 Choice d suggests that the flag state is the only state to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over its vessels on the high seas with no exceptions, which is not entirely true as there are exceptions, such as piracy.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the question.  The question is asking whether treaties should have a specific form.
 Next,  I need to analyze the choices.  Choice a) suggests that treaties should always have a particular form and be designated as such.  Choice b) suggests that treaties should always have a particular form,  regardless of how they are designated.  Choice c) suggests that treaties do not have to have a particular form or be designated as such.  Choice d) suggests that treaties should be designated as such,  regardless of their form.

"Input: What is the fundamental premise of monist theory?  Choices: a) Monism posits that international law is superior to domestic laws b) Monism posits that international and domestic law are part of the same legal order c) Monism posits that domestic laws are superior to international law d) Monism posits that domestic and international law never clash 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of monist theory.  Monist theory is a legal philosophy that views international and domestic law as part of the same legal order.
 Next,  I need to compare the given choices to the definition of monist theory.  Choice a) is incorrect because it suggests that international law is superior,  which is not the premise of monist theory.  Choice c) is incorrect because it suggests that domestic law is superior,  which is also not the premise of monist theory.  Choice d) is incorrect because it suggests that domestic and international law never clash,  which is not true in the context of monist theory.

"Input: Where do we find the 'general principles of law recognized by civilized nations' (article 38  ICJ Statute)?  Choices: a) We look for established principles of law recognized only among the most civilised nations b) We look for established principles of law,  which are common to all major legal systems c) We look for general principles of international law recognized by international courts and tribunals d) We look for general principles of law recognized by all nations 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the context of the question,  which is the 'general principles of law recognized by civilized nations' as mentioned in article 38  of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) Statute.
 Next,  we need to consider the choices given and evaluate which one aligns with the context.
 a) This choice focuses on 'established principles of law recognized only among the most civilized nations,' which is not the same as 'civilized nations' in the context.
 b) This choice mentions 'established principles of law,  which are common to all major legal systems,' which is broader than just 'civilized nations' and includes different legal systems.
 c) This choice states 'We look for general principles of international law recognized by international courts and tribunals,' which is related to the context but does not specifically mention 'civilized nations.'
 d) This choice says 'We look for general principles of law recognized by all nations,' which is the closest to the original context of 'general principles of law recognized by civilized nations.'

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: When does an illegal act of violence on the high seas fall short of qualifying as piracy?  Choices: a) When it is committed against a public vessel of another State b) When it is committed for 'private ends' c) When it is committed by a warship even when its crew has mutinied and taken control of the ship d) When it is not committed against another vessel and when it is not committed for 'private ends' 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the definition of piracy.  Piracy is an illegal act of violence on the high seas that is committed against another vessel or its cargo,  and it is done for private ends.
 Next,  I need to consider each choice and see if it falls short of qualifying as piracy.
 a) When it is committed against a public vessel of another State: This does not fall short of qualifying as piracy because piracy can be committed against any vessel,  not just private vessels.
 b) When it is committed for 'private ends': This is the definition of piracy,  so it does not fall short of qualifying as piracy.
 c) When it is committed by a warship even when its crew has mutinied and taken control of the ship: This does not fall short of qualifying as piracy because piracy can be committed by any vessel,  not just private vessels.
 d) When it is not committed against another vessel and when it is not committed for 'private ends': This choice falls short of qualifying as piracy because piracy requires both violence against another vessel or its cargo and being committed for private ends.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: What is the meaning of ""armed attack"" in Article 51  UN Charter?  Choices: a) Armed attack includes all types of armed force b) Armed attack includes all high intensity instances of armed force c) Armed attack includes terrorist attacks d) An ""armed attack"" gives the right to invade the aggressor State 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of Article 51  UN Charter.  This article allows member states to take collective action in response to an armed attack.
 Next,  I need to consider the definition of ""armed attack"" within this context.  An armed attack is a use of force by one state against another,  which can include all types of armed force.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the given choices.  Choice a) is too broad,  as it includes all types of armed force,  not just those that would constitute an armed attack. Choice b) is closer,  but it focuses on high intensity instances,  which is not the only requirement for an armed attack. Choice c) is incorrect,  as terrorist attacks are not necessarily armed attacks under international law. Choice d) is not the definition of an armed attack,  but rather a consequence of an armed attack.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Who is an 'injured State' in the law of international responsibility?  Choices: a) A State is 'injured' in case that it has suffered a damage from the internationally wrongful conduct b) A State is 'injured' in cases that there has been a violation of a peremptory norm of international law c) A State is 'injured' should it acknowledge the existence of the internationally wrongful conduct d) A State is 'injured' if the obligation breached was owed to it individually or if it was owed to a group of States,  including that State,  and it was specially affected 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of an 'injured State' in the law of international responsibility.  An 'injured State' is a State that has suffered a damage as a result of the internationally wrongful conduct of another State.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given and determine which one best describes an 'injured State'.
 a) A State is 'injured' in case that it has suffered a damage from the internationally wrongful conduct - This choice focuses on the fact that a State is injured if it has suffered damage as a result of the wrongful conduct.
 b) A State is 'injured' in cases that there has been a violation of a peremptory norm of international law - This choice focuses on the violation of peremptory norms,  but it does not necessarily mean that the State has suffered damage.
 c) A State is 'injured' should it acknowledge the existence of the internationally wrongful conduct - This choice focuses on the acknowledgment of the wrongful conduct,  but it does not necessarily mean that the State has suffered damage.
 d) A State is 'injured' if the obligation breached was owed to it individually or if it was owed to a group of States,  including that State,  and it was specially affected - This choice focuses on the specific circumstances under which a State may be injured.

After analyzing the choices,  I can conclude that the best definition of an 'injured State' is a State that has suffered a damage from the internationally wrongful conduct of another State.
Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: What is personal (ratione personae) immunity?  Choices: a) Personal immunity is afforded to all physical persons b) Personal immunity is that which is afforded in a personal capacity and hence does not cover conduct of the State as such c) Personal immunity is afforded only to particular persons irrespective if their conduct was undertaken in a private or public capacity d) Personal immunity is afforded to State officials for conduct undertaken in a public capacity 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the concept of personal (ratione personae) immunity. This term refers to immunity that is granted to individuals based on their personal capacity, rather than their official capacity.

Next, let's analyze the choices given:
a) Personal immunity is afforded to all physical persons - This choice is too broad and does not specify the basis for immunity.
b) Personal immunity is that which is afforded in a personal capacity and hence does not cover conduct of the State as such - This choice accurately describes personal (ratione personae) immunity, as it is immunity granted based on an individual's personal capacity and does not cover the conduct of the State.
c) Personal immunity is afforded only to particular persons irrespective if their conduct was undertaken in a private or public capacity - This choice is incorrect because it implies that personal immunity is limited to specific individuals, which is not the case. Personal immunity is based on the individual's personal capacity, not their specific conduct.
d) Personal immunity is afforded to State officials for conduct undertaken in a public capacity - This choice is incorrect because it specifies immunity for State officials and their public capacity conduct, which is not the definition of personal (ratione personae) immunity.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following statements best describes the UN Human Rights Council?  Choices: a) The UN Human Rights Council has the power to impose economic sanctions on a state for human rights violations b) The UN Human Rights Council scrutinises the human rights records of member states on the Council and each member state of the UN c) The UN Human Rights Council replaced the Economic and Social Committee of the UN d) The UN Human Rights Council consists of 27  member states 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the purpose and function of the UN Human Rights Council.  The UN Human Rights Council is an intergovernmental body established to promote and protect human rights.
 Next,  I will evaluate each statement based on the information about the UN Human Rights Council.
 a) The UN Human Rights Council has the power to impose economic sanctions on a state for human rights violations - This statement is partially true. The Council can impose sanctions, but it is not limited to economic sanctions. It can also impose other measures.
 b) The UN Human Rights Council scrutinises the human rights records of member states on the Council and each member state of the UN - This statement is true. The Council's main function is to monitor and report on the human rights situations in all countries.
 c) The UN Human Rights Council replaced the Economic and Social Committee of the UN - This statement is false. The UN Human Rights Council was established in 2006, while the Economic and Social Committee has been in existence since the founding of the UN in 1945.
 d) The UN Human Rights Council consists of 27  member states - This statement is false. The Council currently has 47 member states.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: When a reservation is considered as invalid under the law of treaties?  Choices: a) A reservation is invalid when the majority of the State parties objects to it b) A reservation is invalid only when an international tribunal says so c) A reservation is invalid only when is incompatible with a peremptory norm of international law (jus cogens) d) A reservation is invalid when it is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the conditions under which a reservation is considered invalid under the law of treaties.  According to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,  a reservation is considered invalid if it is incompatible with a peremptory norm of international law (jus cogens) or if it is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty.

Next,  we can evaluate the choices given:
a) A reservation is invalid when the majority of the State parties objects to it - This is not a universally accepted condition for the invalidity of a reservation.  The Vienna Convention does not specify that the majority of State parties must object for a reservation to be invalid.
b) A reservation is invalid only when an international tribunal says so - This is not the only condition for the invalidity of a reservation.  The Vienna Convention states that a reservation is invalid if it is incompatible with a peremptory norm of international law or if it is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty, not solely based on the opinion of an international tribunal.
c) A reservation is invalid only when is incompatible with a peremptory norm of international law (jus cogens) - This choice is partially correct but incomplete.  A reservation is indeed invalid if it is incompatible with a peremptory norm of international law, but it can also be invalid if it is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty.
d) A reservation is invalid when it is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty - This choice aligns with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which states that a reservation is invalid if it is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: What kind of rights do coastal States enjoy over their continental shelf?  Choices: a) The coastal State enjoy ipso facto and ab initio sovereign rights over its continental shelf for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources b) The coastal State may exercise sovereign rights over its continental shelf only upon its declaration c) The coastal State exercise sovereign rights over its continental shelf for the purpose of exploiting its fishing resources d) The coastal State may exercise only limited rights over its continental shelf and only upon the consent of its neighbouring States 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of the continental shelf.  The continental shelf is an extension of the land territory of a coastal State to a point beyond which the depth of the seaward side of the shelf descends to a depth of 200 meters or more.
 Next,  I need to consider the rights that coastal States have over their continental shelf.  According to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, coastal States have sovereign rights over their continental shelf for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Are there any limits to the application of article 103  of the UN Charter?  Choices: a) No,  there are no limits to article 103  b) Yes,  Article 103  cannot trump multilateral treaties c) Yes,  article 103  of the UN Charter cannot trump jus cogens norms d) Yes,  when a case is submitted to the ICJ,  article 103  ceases to have any effect 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of article 103  of the UN Charter.  Article 103  states that member states must perform their financial obligations to the UN and that their other obligations may be affected if they fail to meet these financial obligations.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given and their implications.  Choice a) suggests that there are no limits to article 103,  which would mean it can be applied in any situation.  Choice b) suggests that article 103 cannot trump multilateral treaties, which would limit its application.  Choice c) suggests that article 103 cannot trump jus cogens norms, which are peremptory norms of general international law.  Choice d) suggests that when a case is submitted to the ICJ,  article 103 ceases to have any effect, which would also limit its application.
 To determine the correct answer,  I need to consider the hierarchy of international law.  Jus cogens norms are above all other sources of international law, including the UN Charter and multilateral treaties.  Therefore,  article 103 of the UN Charter cannot trump jus cogens norms.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Can countries rely on their domestic law as an excuse to violate their obligations under international law?  Choices: a) Domestic law always prevails over international law b) Only customary international law prevails over domestic law c) Obligations under international law prevail over domestic law d) Constitutional obligations always prevail over obligations under international law 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the relationship between domestic law and international law.  International law is a set of rules that are recognized and enforced by the international community,  while domestic law refers to the laws within a country.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  Choice a suggests that domestic law always takes precedence over international law,  which is not true because international law has a higher level of universality and is binding on all states.
 Choice b suggests that only customary international law takes precedence over domestic law,  but this is not accurate because all international law, including customary law,  takes precedence over domestic law.
 Choice c states that obligations under international law take precedence over domestic law,  which is consistent with the principle of the supremacy of international law.
 Choice d suggests that constitutional obligations always take precedence over obligations under international law,  which is not true because international law is binding on all states,  including those with constitutional obligations.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: What is meant by an international organisation's implied powers?  Choices: a) Implied are those powers which are necessary in order for an organisation to carry out the tasks conferred upon it and which are not stipulated in its charter b) It refers to new powers assumed unilaterally by the organisation c) It refers to powers conferred upon the organisation by the international Community d) Implied powers are those whose determination depends on an expansive interpretation of an organisation's charter 
 Output:
 First, I need to understand the concept of an international organisation's implied powers. Implied powers are powers that an organization is expected to have based on its purpose and the tasks it is supposed to carry out, even though they are not explicitly mentioned in its charter.

Next, I will compare each choice to the definition of implied powers.

a) Implied are those powers which are necessary in order for an organisation to carry out the tasks conferred upon it and which are not stipulated in its charter - This choice aligns with the definition of implied powers, as it describes powers that are necessary for the organization to perform its tasks but are not explicitly stated in its charter.

b) It refers to new powers assumed unilaterally by the organisation - This choice does not match the definition, as implied powers are not assumed unilaterally but are necessary for the organization's tasks.

c) It refers to powers conferred upon the organisation by the international Community - This choice is not accurate, as implied powers are not explicitly given by the international community but are necessary for the organization's tasks.

d) Implied powers are those whose determination depends on an expansive interpretation of an organisation's charter - This choice is not correct, as implied powers are not determined through an expansive interpretation of the charter but are necessary for the organization's tasks.

Therefore, the correct answer is the one that matches the definition of implied powers. The answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: What are the criteria for statehood under the 1933  Montevideo Convention?

 Output:
 First,  I need to recall the criteria for statehood as outlined in the 1933  Montevideo Convention.  According to the convention,  a state must have a permanent population,  a defined territory,  a government,  and the capacity to enter into foreign relations.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the given choices to see which one matches the criteria outlined in the Montevideo Convention.  Choice a) is about peace and not an aggressor,  but it does not mention the other criteria.  Choice b) is about recognition,  but it does not mention the other criteria.  Choice d) mentions borders and recognition,  but it does not mention the other criteria.
 Choice c) mentions all the criteria outlined in the Montevideo Convention: a permanent population,  a defined territory,  a government,  and the capacity to enter into foreign relations.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
