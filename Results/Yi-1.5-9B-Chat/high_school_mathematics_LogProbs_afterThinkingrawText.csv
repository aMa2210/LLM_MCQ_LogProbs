"Input: If a pentagon P with vertices at (– 2,  – 4 ),  (– 4,  1 ),  (–1,  4 ),  (2,  4 ),  and (3,  0 ) is reflected across the line y = x to get a new pentagon,  P’,  then one of the vertices of P’ is Choices: a) (0,  – 3 ) b) (4,  1 ) c) (2,  2 ) d) (– 4,  –2 ) 
 Output:
 First,  I need to reflect each vertex of pentagon P across the line y = x.  The line y = x is the line of symmetry for the reflection.
 For the vertex (–2,  –4 ),  to reflect it across y = x,  I swap the x and y coordinates,  so the new vertex is (–4,  –2 ).
 For the vertex (–4,  1 ),  to reflect it across y = x,  I swap the x and y coordinates,  so the new vertex is (1,  –4 ).
 For the vertex (–1,  4 ),  to reflect it across y = x,  I swap the x and y coordinates,  so the new vertex is (4,  –1 ).
 For the vertex (2,  4 ),  to reflect it across y = x,  I swap the x and y coordinates,  so the new vertex is (4,  2 ).
 For the vertex (3,  0 ),  to reflect it across y = x,  I swap the x and y coordinates,  so the new vertex is (0,  3 ).
 Comparing the choices with the reflected vertices,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: The length of a rectangle is twice its width.  Given the length of the diagonal is $5 \sqrt{5 }$,  find the area of the rectangle.  Choices: a) 2500  b) 2  c) 50  d) 25  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the width and length of the rectangle.  Since the length is twice the width,  let's call the width 'w' and the length '2w'.
 The diagonal of a rectangle forms a right triangle with the length and width,  so I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the relationship between the width, length, and diagonal.  The theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse (diagonal) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (length and width).
 So,  I have (2w)^2 + w^2 = (5√5)^2.
 Simplifying,  I get 4w^2 + w^2 = 125 * 5.
 Combining like terms,  I get 5w^2 = 625.
 Dividing by 5,  I get w^2 = 125.
 Taking the square root of both sides,  I get w = √125 = 5√5.
 Now that I have the width,  I can find the length: 2w = 2 * 5√5 = 10√5.
 The area of a rectangle is length times width,  so the area is 5√5 * 10√5 = 50 * 5 = 250.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A positive integer n is called “powerful” if,  for every prime factor p of n,  p^2  is also a factor of n.  An example of a powerful number is Choices: a) 392  b) 336  c) 300  d) 297  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the prime factors of each number.
 For 392,  the prime factors are 2  and 7.  Since 2^2  = 4  is a factor of 392,  and 7^2  = 49  is also a factor of 392,  392 is a powerful number.
 For 336,  the prime factors are 2  and 7.  However,  2^2  = 4  is a factor of 336,  but 7^2  = 49  is not a factor of 336,  so 336 is not a powerful number.
 For 300,  the prime factors are 2,  3, and 5.  Since 2^2  = 4  is a factor of 300,  but 3^2  = 9  and 5^2  = 25  are not factors of 300,  300 is not a powerful number.
 For 297,  the prime factors are 3.  Since 3^2  = 9  is a factor of 297,  297 is a powerful number.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: At breakfast,  lunch,  and dinner,  Joe randomly chooses with equal probabilities either an apple,  an orange,  or a banana to eat.  On a given day,  what is the probability that Joe will eat at least two different kinds of fruit?  Choices: a) \\frac{7 }{9 } b) \\frac{8 }{9 } c) \\frac{5 }{9 } d) \\frac{9 }{11 } 
 Output:
 First,  I will calculate the probability that Joe eats all the same kind of fruit,  which means he eats either three apples,  three oranges,  or three bananas.  The probability of eating three apples is \frac{1}{3}  * \frac{1}{3}  * \frac{1}{3}  = \frac{1}{27}.  Similarly,  the probability of eating three oranges or three bananas is also \frac{1}{27}.  So,  the total probability of eating all the same kind of fruit is \frac{1}{27}  + \frac{1}{27}  + \frac{1}{27}  = \frac{1}{9}.
 Next,  I will calculate the probability that Joe eats at least two different kinds of fruit.  Since the probability of eating all the same kind of fruit is \frac{1}{9},  the probability of eating at least two different kinds of fruit is 1  - \frac{1}{9}  = \frac{8}{9}.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Suppose $f(x)$ is a function that has this property: For all real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a<b$,  the portion of the graph of $y=f(x)$ between $x=a$ and $x=b$ lies below the line segment whose endpoints are $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$.  (A function with this property is called strictly convex. ) Given that $f(x)$ passes through $(-2,5 )$ and $(2,9 )$,  what is the range of all possible values for $f(1 )$?  Express your answer in interval notation.  Choices: a) (-inf,  10 ) b) (-inf,  9 ) c) (-inf,  8 ) d) (-inf,  7 ) 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the property of the function $f(x)$.  This property states that for any two points $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$ on the graph of $f(x)$,  the graph of $f(x)$ between $x=a$ and $x=b$ lies below the line segment connecting these two points.  This means that the function is strictly convex.

Next,  I need to use the given points $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$ to find the equation of the line segment connecting these points.  The slope of the line segment is $\frac{9-5}{2-(-2)} = \frac{4}{4} = 1$.  Using the point-slope form of a line,  the equation of the line segment is $y-5 = 1(x-(-2))$,  which simplifies to $y = x + 7$.

Now,  I need to consider the possible values of $f(1)$.  Since $f(x)$ is strictly convex, the graph of $f(x)$ must lie below the line segment connecting $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$ for all $x$ between $-2$ and $2$,  inclusive.  Therefore,  the value of $f(1)$ must be less than the value of the line segment at $x=1$,  which is $1 + 7 = 8$.

Thus,  the range of all possible values for $f(1)$ is $(-\infty, 8)$.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles.  The two piles had an equal number of pins.  He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.  John had 66  pins left.  How many pins did John originally have?  Choices: a) 396  b) 72  c) 66  d) 36  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine how many pins John gave to his brother.  He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.  Let's call the number of pins in one pile x.  So,  the number of pins John gave to his brother is (1/2) * (1/3) * x = x/6.
 Since the two piles had an equal number of pins,  the total number of pins John had before giving any to his brother is 2x.
 After giving his brother x/6 pins,  John had 66  pins left.  So,  2x - x/6 = 66.
 To solve for x,  I need to find a common denominator for 2 and 1/6,  which is 6.  So,  2x - x/6 = (12/6)x - (1/6)x = (11/6)x.
 Now,  I can rewrite the equation as (11/6)x = 66.
 To solve for x,  I multiply both sides by 6/11: x = (6/11) * 66 = 36.
 Since x represents the number of pins in one pile,  John originally had 2x = 2 * 36 = 72 pins.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A meteorologist reports that there is a 30 % probability of rain and no sun.  If there is a 40 % probability of no rain,  then the probability of both rain and sun is Choices: a) 0.16  b) 0.24  c) 0.3  d) 0.5  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the probability of either rain or sun.  Since there is a 30 % probability of rain and no sun,  and a 40 % probability of no rain,  I can subtract the no rain probability from 100 % to find the probability of rain or sun: 100 % - 40 % = 60 %.
 Next,  I need to find the probability of both rain and sun.  Since the probability of either rain or sun is 60 %,  and the probability of rain (with no sun) is 30 %,  I can subtract the probability of rain from the probability of rain or sun to find the probability of both rain and sun: 60 % - 30 % = 30 %.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: What is the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ such that $n^2 $ is a factor of $1200 $?  Choices: a) 42  b) 12  c) 36  d) 39  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the prime factorization of 1200.  1200 can be factored as $2^4 * 3 * 5^2$.
 Next,  I need to determine the possible values of $n$.  Since $n^2$ is a factor of 1200, $n$ can be any combination of the prime factors of 1200,  raised to a power from 0 to 2 (since it's being squared).
 The possible values of $n$ are: $2^0 = 1$, $2^1 = 2$, $2^2 = 4$, $3^0 = 1$, $3^1 = 3$, and $5^0 = 1$, $5^1 = 5$.
 Now,  I need to sum these values: $1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 5 = 16$.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: We roll a fair 6 -sided die 5  times.  What is the probability that we get a 6  in at most 2  of the rolls?  Choices: a) \\frac{125 }{648 } b) \\frac{25 }{648 } c) \\frac{625 }{648 } d) \\frac{1 }{648 } 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the different ways we can get a 6  in at most 2  of the rolls.  This can happen in two cases: we get 0  6s or we get 1  6 or we get 2  6s.
 For the first case,  we get 0  6s,  which means all 5  rolls are not a 6.  The probability of not getting a 6 in one roll is 5/6,  so the probability of not getting a 6 in all 5  rolls is (5/6)^5 = 3125/7776.
 For the second case,  we get 1  6,  which means 1  roll is a 6 and the other 4  rolls are not.  The probability of getting a 6 in one roll is 1/6,  and the probability of not getting a 6 in the other 4  rolls is (5/6)^4 = 625/1296.  There are 5  ways to choose which roll is the 6,  so the total probability for this case is 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296) = 3125/7776.
 For the third case,  we get 2  6s,  which means 2  rolls are 6s and the other 3  rolls are not.  The probability of getting a 6 in one roll is 1/6,  and the probability of not getting a 6 in the other 3  rolls is (5/6)^3 = 125/216.  There are 10  ways to choose which rolls are the 2  6s,  so the total probability for this case is 10 * (1/6)^2 * (125/216) = 625/7776.
 To find the total probability of getting a 6 in at most 2  of the rolls,  I add the probabilities of the three cases: 3125/7776 + 3125/7776 + 625/7776 = 648/648.
 However,  this is not one of the given choices,  so I made a mistake in my calculations.  Let's reevaluate the second and third cases.The correct probability for the second case, where we get 1 six, is calculated as follows:

 For the second case, we get 1 six, which means 1 roll is a 6 and the other 4 rolls are not. The probability of getting a 6 in one roll is 1/6, and the probability of not getting a 6 in the other 4 rolls is (5/6)^4 = 625/1296. There are 5 ways to choose which roll is the 6, so the total probability for this case is 5 * (1/6) * (625/1296) = 3125/7776.

 For the third case, we get 2 sixes, which means 2 rolls are 6s and the other 3 rolls are not. The probability of getting a 6 in one roll is 1/6, and the probability of not getting a 6 in the other 3 rolls is (5/6)^3 = 125/216. There are 10 ways to choose which rolls are the 2 sixes, so the total probability for this case is 10 * (1/6)^2 * (125/216) = 625/7776.

 To find the total probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls, I add the probabilities of the three cases: 3125/7776 + 625/7776 = 3750/7776.

 Simplifying the fraction, we get 125/256.

 Therefore, the correct answer is not among the given choices. There might be an error in the question or the provided options.The answer is: {'sol': 'not available'}"
"Input: How many arithmetic sequences of consecutive odd integers sum to 240?  Choices: a) 8  b) 12  c) 10  d) 4  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the possible sequences of consecutive odd integers that sum to 240.  I will start with the smallest possible sequence and work my way up.
 The smallest sequence is 111,  since 111  is the smallest odd integer that can be part of a sequence that sums to 240.  The next odd integer is 113,  and the next is 115,  and so on.
 I will now calculate the sum of each sequence and see if it equals 240.  I will continue until the sum exceeds 240.
 The sequence 111 + 113 + 115 + 117 + 119 = 585,  which is too large.  So,  I will try the next sequence.
 The sequence 109 + 111 + 113 + 115 + 117 + 119 = 660,  which is also too large.  I will continue this process until I find the sequences that sum to 240.
 After trying several sequences,  I find that the following sequences sum to 240:
 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 240
 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 = 240
 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 = 240
 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 + 21 = 240
 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 + 21 + 23 = 240
 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 + 21 + 23 + 25 = 240
 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 + 21 + 23 + 25 + 27 = 240
 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 + 21 + 23 + 25 + 27 + 29 = 240
 There are 8  sequences that sum to 240.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Positive integers $x$ and $y$ have a product of 56  and $x < y$.  Seven times the reciprocal of the smaller integer plus 14  times the reciprocal of the larger integer equals 4.  What is the value of $x$?  Choices: a) 13  b) 14  c) 1  d) 2  
 Output:
 First,  I need to set up the equations based on the given information.  The product of $x$ and $y$ is 56,  so I can write the equation $x * y = 56$.
 The second equation comes from the statement ""Seven times the reciprocal of the smaller integer plus 14 times the reciprocal of the larger integer equals 4"".  This can be written as $7/x + 14/y = 4$.
 Now,  I need to solve these equations to find the value of $x$.
 I can start by simplifying the second equation.  To do this,  I can multiply both sides by $xy$ to eliminate the fractions: $7y + 14x = 4xy$.
 Since I know that $xy = 56$,  I can substitute this value into the equation: $7y + 14x = 4 * 56$.
 Simplifying further,  I get $7y + 14x = 224$.
 Now,  I can divide both sides by 7 to simplify the equation: $y + 2x = 32$.
 I can use this equation to express $y$ in terms of $x$: $y = 32 - 2x$.
 Next,  I can substitute this expression for $y$ into the first equation: $x * (32 - 2x) = 56$.
 Expanding the equation,  I get $32x - 2x^2 = 56$.
 Rearranging the terms,  I get $2x^2 - 32x + 56 = 0$.
 To solve this quadratic equation,  I can divide all terms by 2 to simplify: $x^2 - 16x + 28 = 0$.
 Now,  I can factor the quadratic equation: $(x - 14)(x - 2) = 0$.
 This gives me two possible values for $x$: $x = 14$ or $x = 2$.
 However,  the problem states that $x < y$,  so the only valid solution is $x = 2$.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Given that $n > 1 $,  what is the smallest positive integer $n$ whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6 $?  Choices: a) 30  b) 64  c) 2048  d) 60  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand that the product of the positive divisors of a number is equal to $n^{\frac{d(n)}{2}} $,  where $d(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$.
 In this case,  I'm given that the product of the divisors is $n^6 $,  so I can set up the equation $n^{\frac{d(n)}{2}} = n^6 $.
 To solve for $d(n)$,  I can divide both sides by $n^6 $,  resulting in $n^{\frac{d(n)}{2} - 6} = 1 $.
 Since $n > 1 $,  the only way for the exponent to be 0 is if $\frac{d(n)}{2} - 6 = 0 $.
 Solving for $d(n)$,  I find that $d(n) = 12 $.
 Now,  I need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ with 12 divisors.
 The number 64 has 12 divisors: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: What is the remainder when $2 ^{87 } +3 $ is divided by $7 $?  Choices: a) 0  b) 1  c) 2  d) 4  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the remainder when $2 ^{87}$ is divided by $7$.  To do this,  I can use the property of modular arithmetic that states $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n$ if $a$ and $n$ are coprime.  In this case,  $2$ and $7$ are coprime,  so I can use Euler's totient function to find that $\phi(7) = 6$.  Therefore,  $2^{6} \equiv 1 \mod 7$.

Next,  I can rewrite $2^{87}$ as $(2^{6})^{14} \cdot 2^{3}$.  Using the property of modular arithmetic,  I can simplify this to $(1)^{14} \cdot 2^{3} \equiv 2^{3} \mod 7$.

Now,  I need to find the remainder when $2^{3}$ is divided by $7$.  $2^{3} = 8 \equiv 1 \mod 7$.

So,  the remainder when $2^{87}$ is divided by $7$ is $1$.

Finally,  I need to add $3$ to this remainder and find the new remainder when divided by $7$.  $1 + 3 = 4$,  and $4 \equiv 4 \mod 7$.

 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the sum of Jane's quiz scores.  The scores are 98,  97,  92,  85,  and 93,  so the sum is 98 + 97 + 92 + 85 + 93 = 465.
 Next,  I need to determine the number of quizzes Jane took.  She took 5 quizzes.
 To find the mean score,  I divide the sum of the scores by the number of quizzes: 465 ÷ 5 = 93.

"Input: Suppose the graph of f is both increasing and concave up on a <= x <= b.  Then,  using the same number of subdivisions,  and with L,  R,  M,  and T denoting,  respectively,  left,  right,  midpoint,  and trapezoid sums,  it follows that Choices: a) R <= T <= M <= L b) L <= T <= M <= R c) R <= M <= T <= L d) L <= M <= T <= R 
 Output:
 First,  let's consider the left endpoint sum (L).  Since the function is increasing,  the left endpoint will always be the smallest value in each subinterval,  so the left endpoint sum will always underestimate the actual area under the curve.
 Next,  consider the right endpoint sum (R).  Since the function is increasing,  the right endpoint will always be the largest value in each subinterval,  so the right endpoint sum will always overestimate the actual area under the curve.
 Now,  let's look at the midpoint sum (M).  The midpoint sum takes the average of the left and right endpoints,  which means it will generally provide a better approximation of the actual area under the curve than the left or right endpoint sums.
 Finally,  consider the trapezoid sum (T).  The trapezoid sum approximates the area under the curve by using trapezoids instead of rectangles.  Since the function is concave up,  the trapezoids will generally provide a better approximation of the actual area under the curve than the left or right endpoint sums.

Given that the function is both increasing and concave up,  the order of the approximations from best to worst is: T (trapezoid sum),  M (midpoint sum),  L (left endpoint sum),  and R (right endpoint sum).

 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the distance from $(-4,6 )$ to the origin.  Using the distance formula,  the distance is \\sqrt{(0-(-4))^2 + (0-6)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 36} = \\sqrt{52}.
 Next,  I need to calculate the distance from the origin to $(4,3 )$.  Using the distance formula,  the distance is \\sqrt{(4-0)^2 + (3-0)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 9} = \\sqrt{25} = 5.
 The total distance traveled is \\sqrt{52} + 5.
 Comparing this to the choices,  the closest answer is d) 5 +2 \\sqrt{13 }.

"Input: The polynomial which results from the expansion of $(x^2 +5 x+6 )^2 +(px+q)(x^3 +7 x^2 +3 x)$ has degree $2 $.  Find $p+q$.  Choices: a) -2  b) -4  c) -1  d) 1  
 Output:
 First,  I need to expand $(x^2 +5 x+6 )^2$.  Using the formula $(a+b)^2 = a^2 +2 ab +b^2$,  I get $(x^2 +5 x+6 )^2 = x^4 +10 x^3 +30 x^2 +60 x+36$.
 Next,  I need to expand $(px+q)(x^3 +7 x^2 +3 x)$.  Using the distributive property,  I get $(px+q)(x^3 +7 x^2 +3 x) = p x^4 +7 p x^3 +3 p x^2 +q x^3 +7 q x^2 +3 q x$.
 Now,  I need to add the two expanded polynomials: $x^4 +10 x^3 +30 x^2 +60 x+36 + p x^4 +7 p x^3 +3 p x^2 +q x^3 +7 q x^2 +3 q x$.
 The resulting polynomial has degree 2,  which means the terms with the highest power of x must cancel out.  This means $1 +p = 0$,  so $p = -1$.
 To find $q$,  I need to set the coefficient of $x^2$ to 0.  This gives me $30 +7 p +q = 0$.  Substituting $p = -1$,  I get $30 -7 -1 = 0$,  so $q = -23$.
 Finally,  I need to find $p+q$.  Substituting the values of $p$ and $q$,  I get $-1 -23 = -24$.

"Input: If $f(x)=ax^6 -bx^4 +x-1 $ and $f(2 )=5 $,  then what is the value of $f(-2 )$?  Choices: a) 1  b) 3  c) 0  d) 5  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the values of a and b using the given information.  We know that $f(2)=5$,  so I can substitute x=2 into the function: $f(2)=a(2)^6 -b(2)^4 +2-1 = 5$.
 Simplifying,  I get $64a -16b +1 = 5$,  which can be rewritten as $64a -16b = 4$.
 Now,  I need to find $f(-2)$.  I can substitute x=-2 into the function: $f(-2)=a(-2)^6 -b(-2)^4 -2-1$.
 Simplifying,  I get $64a -16b -3$.
 Since I already have $64a -16b = 4$,  I can substitute this into the expression for $f(-2)$: $f(-2)=4-3=1$.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: What is the range of the function $f(x) = \frac{1 }{1 -x}$?  Express your answer in interval notation.  Choices: a) (-\\infty, -1 )\\cup (1, \\infty) b) (-\\infty,0 )\\cup (0, \\infty) c) -1,1  d) (-1,1 ) 
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the domain of the function $f(x) = \frac{1 }{1 -x}$.  The function is undefined when the denominator is zero,  so I need to find the values of $x$ that make $1 - x = 0$.  Solving for $x$,  I get $x = 1$.  So,  the domain of the function is all real numbers except $x = 1$,  which can be written as (-\\infty, 1) \\cup (1, \\infty).
 Next,  I need to find the range of the function.  To do this,  I can look at the behavior of the function as $x$ approaches the endpoints of the domain.  As $x$ approaches 1 from the left,  the function approaches $-\\infty$.  As $x$ approaches 1 from the right,  the function approaches $+\\infty$.  In between,  the function takes on all values except $f(x) = 1$,  since $f(x) = 1$ when $x = 0$,  which is not in the domain.
 Therefore,  the range of the function is (-\\infty, -1 )\\cup (1, \\infty).

"Input: What is the inverse of $f(x)=4 -5 x$?  Choices: a) \\frac{5 }{x-4 } b) \\frac{x-4 }{5 } c) \\frac{x+4 }{5 } d) -\\frac{x-4 }{5 } 
 Output:
 First,  to find the inverse function,  we need to switch the roles of $x$ and $y$ in the original function and solve for $y$.  So,  we start with $x=4 -5 y$.
 Next,  we solve for $y$.  Subtracting 4 from both sides gives $-5 y = x - 4$.  Then,  dividing by $-5$ gives $y = \\frac{4 - x}{5}$.
 Now,  we can write the inverse function as $f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{4 - x}{5}$.
 Comparing this to the given choices,  we see that it matches choice c) $\\frac{x+4 }{5 }$.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the pattern of the series.  The first term is 2.  Each subsequent term is obtained by multiplying the preceding term by −2.
 So,  the second term is 2  * (−2) = −4.
 The third term is −4  * (−2) = 8.
 The fourth term is 8  * (−2) = −16.
 The fifth term is −16  * (−2) = 32.

"Input: How many ways are there to put 4  distinguishable balls into 2  indistinguishable boxes?  Choices: a) 7  b) 11  c) 16  d) 8  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the different ways the balls can be distributed among the boxes.  Since the boxes are indistinguishable,  the only thing that matters is the number of balls in each box.
 I can have all 4  balls in one box and none in the other,  which is 1  way.
 I can have 3  balls in one box and 1  in the other,  which is 4  ways (since each of the 4  balls can be the one in a different box).
 I can have 2  balls in one box and 2  in the other,  which is 6  ways (using the combination formula: C(4,2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 6).
 So,  the total number of ways is 1  + 4  + 6  = 11 .
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: How many positive integers are factors of 120  and also factors of 40?  Choices: a) 4  b) 8  c) 2  d) 1

"Input: Carlos Montado was born on Saturday,  November 9,  2002.  On what day of the week will Carlos be 706  days old?  (Spell out the entire day of the week. ) Choices: a) Friday b) Thursday c) Wednesday d) Tuesday 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine how many days are in a week.  There are 7  days in a week.
 Next,  I need to find out how many full weeks are in 706  days.  To do this,  I divide 706  by 7: 706  ÷ 7  = 100  weeks with a remainder of 6.
 This means that Carlos will be 706  days old after 100  complete weeks and 6  additional days.
 Since Carlos was born on a Saturday,  I need to count 6  days forward from Saturday.  The days of the week in order are: Sunday,  Monday,  Tuesday,  Wednesday,  Thursday,  Friday,  Saturday.
 Counting 6  days forward from Saturday,  we get: Saturday,  Sunday,  Monday,  Tuesday,  Wednesday,  Thursday.

 Next,  I will find the prime factorization of $5! $.  $5! = 5 \cdot 2^3 \cdot 3 $.
 Now,  I need to find the greatest odd integer that is a factor of $5! $.  The odd factors of $5! $ are the products of the odd prime factors.
 The odd factors are $1, 3, 5, $ and $15 $.
 The greatest odd integer among these factors is $15 $.

 Output:
 First,  I need to recall the properties of a parallelogram.  In a parallelogram,  opposite angles are equal.  So,  angle $C$ is equal to angle $A$.
 Next,  I need to use the fact that the sum of the angles in a parallelogram is $360 ^\circ$.  Since angle $B$ measures $110 ^\circ$,  angle $A$ (which is equal to angle $C$) measures $360 ^\circ - 110 ^\circ = 250 ^\circ$.
 However,  this is not one of the given choices.  It seems there was a mistake in the calculation.  Let's correct it.  Since opposite angles are equal, angle $A$ is also $110 ^\circ$.
 Now,  I need to find the measure of angle $C$,  which is equal to angle $A$.  So,  angle $C$ measures $110 ^\circ$.

"Input: The rate at which a purification process can remove contaminants from a tank of water is proportional to the amount of contaminant remaining.  If 20 % of the contaminant can be removed during the first minute of the process and 98 % must be removed to make the water safe,  approximately how long will the decontamination process take?  Choices: a) 2  min b) 5  min c) 18  min d) 20  min 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the rate at which contaminants are removed.  The process removes 20 % of the contaminants in the first minute.
 Next,  I need to determine how many minutes it will take to remove 98 % of the contaminants.  Since 20 % is removed in the first minute,  I need to remove an additional 78 % of the contaminants to reach the 98 % threshold.
 To find out how many minutes it takes to remove 78 % of the contaminants,  I can use the formula for exponential decay: time = log(fraction_remaining) / log(rate_of_removal).
 In this case,  the fraction_remaining is 0.02 (since 2 % of the contaminants are left) and the rate_of_removal is 0.8 (since 20 % of the contaminants are removed each minute).
 Plugging these values into the formula,  I get time = log(0.02) / log(0.8) ≈ 4.2.
 Since the process takes approximately 4.2 minutes to remove the remaining 78 % of contaminants,  the total time for the decontamination process is approximately 1.The answer is: a{""sol"": ""a""}

"Input: What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{x+6 }{\sqrt{x^2 -3 x-4 }}$?  Choices: a) (-4,4 ) b) 0,4  c) (-inf,  -1 ) U (4,  inf) d) (-inf,  -1 ) U (-1,  4 ) U (4,  inf) 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the denominator of the function,  which is $\sqrt{x^2 -3 x-4 }$.  For the function to be defined,  the expression under the square root must be non-negative,  so I need to solve the inequality $x^2 -3 x-4 \geq 0$.
 Next,  I factor the quadratic expression: $(x-4)(x+1) \geq 0$.  To find the solution to this inequality,  I can use a sign chart or test values in each interval.  I'll use a sign chart.
 I'll consider the intervals $(-\infty, -1)$, $(-1, 4)$, and $(4, \infty)$.  I'll test a value in each interval to determine the sign of the expression $(x-4)(x+1)$.
 For $x=-2$,  I have $(-2-4)(-2+1) = (-6)(-1) = 6 > 0$, so the expression is positive in the interval $(-\infty, -1)$.
 For $x=0$,  I have $(0-4)(0+1) = (-4)(1) = -4 < 0$, so the expression is negative in the interval $(-1, 4)$.
 For $x=5$,  I have $(5-4)(5+1) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0$, so the expression is positive in the interval $(4, \infty)$.
 Therefore,  the solution to the inequality is $x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)$.
 Now,  I need to consider the domain of the function,  which is the set of all $x$ values for which the function is defined.  Since the denominator cannot be zero, I need to exclude the values of $x$ that make the denominator zero.  The denominator is zero when $x^2 -3 x-4 = 0$, which has solutions $x=-1$ and $x=4$.
 So,  the domain of the function is the solution to the inequality,  excluding the values $x=-1$ and $x=4$.  This is $x \in (-\infty, -1) \cup (4, \infty)$.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A relative maximum value of the function y = (ln x)/x is Choices: a) 1  b) e c) 2 /e d) 1 /e 
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the derivative of the function y = (ln x)/x.  To do this,  I can use the quotient rule,  which states that the derivative of a quotient is the denominator times the derivative of the numerator minus the numerator times the derivative of the denominator,  all divided by the square of the denominator.
 The derivative of ln x is 1/x,  and the derivative of x is 1,  so the derivative of y is (x * (1/x) - ln x * 1) / x^2.
 Simplifying,  I get (1 - ln x) / x^2.
 To find the relative maximum value,  I need to find where the derivative is equal to zero or undefined.  The derivative is undefined when x = 0,  but since x = 0 is not in the domain of the original function,  I can ignore this value.
 Setting the derivative equal to zero,  I get 1 - ln x = 0,  which means ln x = 1.
 Exponentiating both sides,  I get x = e.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the function at x = e to find the relative maximum value.  Plugging in x = e,  I get y = (ln e)/e = 1/e.

 Output:
 First,  I need to multiply the numbers together to find the product.  Starting with the smallest numbers: $1  \cdot 2  = 2$,  $2  \cdot 3  = 6$,  $6  \cdot 4  = 24$,  $24  \cdot 5  = 120$,  $120  \cdot 6  = 720$,  $720  \cdot 7  = 5040$,  $5040  \cdot 8  = 40320$,  $40320  \cdot 9  = 362880$.
 The ones digit of the product is the same as the ones digit of 362880,  which is 0.

"Input: What is the shortest distance from the origin to the circle defined by $x^2 -24 x +y^2 +10 y +160 =0 $?  Choices: a) 10  b) 16  c) 24  d) 12  
 Output:
 First,  I need to rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form by completing the square for both $x$ and $y$.  The equation can be rewritten as $(x-12)^2 +(y+5)^2 =49$.
 This is the equation of a circle with center $(12,-5)$ and radius $7$.
 The shortest distance from the origin to the circle is the distance from the origin to the center of the circle minus the radius.  Using the distance formula,  the distance from the origin to the center is $\sqrt{(12-0)^2 +(-5-0)^2} = \sqrt{144+25} = \sqrt{169} = 13$.
 Therefore,  the shortest distance is $13 - 7 = 6$.

 The highest power of 2  is 4,  the highest power of 3  is 1,  and the highest power of 5  is 1.
 To find the smallest positive integer with these factors,  I multiply the unique prime factors raised to their highest powers: 2^4  * 3^1  * 5^1  = 16  * 3  * 5  = 240.

 Output:
 First,  I need to choose one suit for the first card.  There are 4  suits to choose from,  so there are 4  ways to choose the first suit.
 Next,  I need to choose one suit for the second card.  Since the second card must be of a different suit from the first card,  there are 3  remaining suits to choose from,  so there are 3  ways to choose the second suit.
 Finally,  I need to choose one suit for the third card.  Since the third card must be of a different suit from the first two cards,  there are 2  remaining suits to choose from,  so there are 2  ways to choose the third suit.
 To find the total number of ways to choose 3  cards of different suits,  I multiply the number of ways for each step: 4  * 3  * 2  = 24  ways.
 However,  since the order of the cards does not matter,  I need to divide by the number of ways to arrange 3  cards,  which is 3! = 6 .
 So,  the total number of ways to choose 3  cards of different suits is 24  ÷ 6  = 4 .

 Output:
 First,  I need to rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form,  which is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$,  where $(h, k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is its radius.
 To do this,  I'll move all the terms to one side of the equation: $x^2 + 10 x + y^2 + 12 y + 57 = 0$.
 Next,  I'll complete the square for both the $x$ and $y$ terms.  For the $x$ terms,  I'll add $(10 ÷ 2)^2 = 25$ to both sides.  For the $y$ terms,  I'll add $(12 ÷ 2)^2 = 36$ to both sides.  This gives me: $x^2 + 10 x + 25 + y^2 + 12 y + 36 + 57 = 25 + 36$.
 Simplifying,  I get: $(x+5)^2 + (y+6)^2 = 61$.
 Now,  I can see that the center of the circle is $(-5, -6)$ and its radius is $\sqrt{61}$.
 To find the value of $a+b+r$,  I add the coordinates of the center and the radius: $-5 + (-6) + \sqrt{61}$.

 First,  I need to find the values of $f(f(1)), $ $f(f(2)), $ and $f(f(3)). $
 Since the graph includes the point $(1,5 ), $ we know that $f(1)=5 . $
 Therefore,  $f(f(1))=f(5) . $ However,  we do not have information about the value of $f(5), $ so this is not one of the two points on the graph of $y=f(f(x)) . $

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the equation $\binom{23 }{4 } + \binom{23 }{5 } = \binom{24 }{k}$.  This is a combination equation,  where $\binom{n}{r}$ represents the number of ways to choose $r$ items from a set of $n$ items.

Next,  I will use the combination formula to simplify the equation.  The combination formula is $\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$.  Using this formula,  I can rewrite the equation as:

$\frac{23!}{4!(23-4)!} + \frac{23!}{5!(23-5)!} = \frac{24!}{k!(24-k)!}$

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

$\frac{23!}{4!20!} + \frac{23!}{5!18!} = \frac{24!}{k!(24-k)!}$

$\frac{23! \cdot 21}{4!20!} + \frac{23! \cdot 22}{5!18!} = \frac{24!}{k!(24-k)!}$

$\frac{23! \cdot 21 \cdot 5}{4!18!} + \frac{23! \cdot 22 \cdot 4}{5!18!} = \frac{24!}{k!(24-k)!}$

$\frac{23! \cdot 105 + 23! \cdot 88}{4!18!} = \frac{24!}{k!(24-k)!}$

$\frac{23! \cdot (105 + 88)}{4!18!} = \frac{24!}{k!(24-k)!}$

$\frac{23! \cdot 193}{4!18!} = \frac{24!}{k!(24-k)!}$

$\frac{23! \cdot 193}{4!18!} = \frac{24!}{k!(24-k)!}$

$\frac{23! \cdot 193}{4!18!} = \frac{24!}{k!(24-k)!}$

$\frac{23! \cdot 193}{4!18!} = \frac{24!}{k!(24-k)!}$

 Output:
 First,  I need to solve the system of equations to find the values of $x$ and $y$.  I can do this by multiplying the first equation by 891 and the second equation by 888,  so that the coefficients of $x$ match:
 891 * ($888 x + 889 y = 890 $) gives $793332 x + 793311 y = 792110 $
 888 * ($891 x + 892 y = 893 $) gives $793332 x + 793332 y = 792546 $

Next,  I can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate $x$:
 ($793332 x + 793332 y = 792546 $) - ($793332 x + 793311 y = 792110 $) gives $21 y = 436 $

Now,  I can solve for $y$: $y = 436 ÷ 21 = 20.76$ (rounded to two decimal places).

To find $x$,  I can substitute the value of $y$ into one of the original equations.  Using the first equation: $888 x + 889 * 20.76 = 890 $
Solving for $x$,  I get $x = (890 - 889 * 20.76) ÷ 888 = -10.76$ (rounded to two decimal places).

Finally,  I can find the value of $x - y$: $x - y = -10.76 - 20.76 = -31.52$ (rounded to two decimal places).

 a) 4: 28690 ÷ 4 = 7172.5,  which is not a whole number,  so 4 is not a factor.
 b) 6: 28690 ÷ 6 = 4781.666...,  which is not a whole number,  so 6 is not a factor.
 c) 10: 28690 ÷ 10 = 2869,  which is a whole number,  so 10 is a factor.
 d) 15: 28690 ÷ 15 = 1912.666...,  which is not a whole number,  so 15 is not a factor.

"Input: A group of people have the number 12345.6789  written on a piece of paper.  Then the group decides to play a game.  The winner of the game is the person who can round the given number and get a number higher than any other person.  Alice rounds to the nearest ten-thousand,  Bob to the nearest thousand,  Carol to the nearest hundred,  Devon to the nearest ten,  and Eugene to the nearest whole number.  In addition,  Felicity rounds the number to the nearest tenth,  Gerald to the nearest hundredth,  Harry to the nearest thousandth,  and Irene rounds to the nearest ten-thousandth.  Who wins the game?  Choices: a) Alice b) Devon c) Bob d) Gerald 
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the rounded numbers for each person.  Starting with the smallest place value,  I'll round to the nearest ten-thousandth for Irene: 12345.6789  rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth is 12345.6790.
 Next,  I'll round to the nearest thousandth for Harry: 12345.6789  rounded to the nearest thousandth is 12345.679.
 Then,  I'll round to the nearest hundredth for Gerald: 12345.6789  rounded to the nearest hundredth is 12345.68.
 Continuing,  I'll round to the nearest tenth for Felicity: 12345.6789  rounded to the nearest tenth is 12345.7.
 Now,  I'll round to the nearest whole number for Eugene: 12345.6789  rounded to the nearest whole number is 12346.

 Then,  I'll round to the nearest hundred for Carol: 12345.6789  rounded to the nearest hundred is 12300.
 Next,  I'll round to the nearest thousand for Bob: 12345.6789  rounded to the nearest thousand is 12000.
 Finally,  I'll round to the nearest ten-thousand for Alice: 12345.6789  rounded to the nearest ten-thousandThe answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Factor $36 -9 x^2 $.  Choices: a) (6 -3 x)(6 +3 x) b) (-3 x+6 )(3 x+6 ) c) 9 (2 -x)(2 +x) d) 3 (2 +x)^2  
 Output:
 First, I recognize that the given expression is a difference of squares, which can be factored as (a - b)(a + b).
 In this case, $36 -9 x^2 $ can be written as $6^2 - (3x)^2 $.
 Applying the difference of squares formula, we get (6 -3 x)(6 +3 x).

"Input: To place the first paving stone in a path,  Alex starts at the crate of stones,  walks three feet,  places the stone,  and returns to the crate.  For each subsequent stone,  Alex walks two feet farther each way.  Alex will place the first 50  stones in a path.  After returning to the crate from placing the $50 ^\text{th}$ stone,  what is the total distance Alex walked,  in feet?  Choices: a) 100  b) 90950  c) 5200  d) 50  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the total distance walked for the first stone.  Alex walks 3  feet to place the stone and then walks 3  feet back to the crate,  so the total distance for the first stone is 3  + 3  = 6  feet.
 Next,  I need to calculate the total distance walked for the second stone.  Alex walks 5  feet to place the stone and then walks 5  feet back to the crate,  so the total distance for the second stone is 5  + 5  = 10  feet.
 I notice that the distance walked for each stone follows an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4  feet.
 To find the total distance walked for the first 50  stones,  I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.
 In this case,  n = 50,  a = 6,  and d = 4.
 Plugging in the values,  I get S = 50/2 * (2*6 + (50-1)*4) = 25 * (12 + 196) = 25 * 208 = 5200.

"Input: A box contains 4  white balls and 4  black balls.  I draw them out of the box,  one at a time.  What is the probability that all of my draws alternate colors?  Choices: a) \\frac{1 }{8 } b) \\frac{1 }{7 } c) \\frac{1 }{40 } d) \\frac{1 }{35 } 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the possible ways to draw the balls so that they alternate colors.  There are two possible sequences: white-black-white-black-white-black-white-black or black-white-black-white-black-white-black-white.
 Next,  I need to calculate the probability of each sequence occurring.  For the white-black sequence,  the probability of drawing a white ball first is 4/8,  then a black ball is 4/7,  then a white ball is 3/6,  and so on.  So the probability of this sequence is (4/8) * (4/7) * (3/6) * (3/5) * (2/4) * (2/3) * (1/2) * (1/1) = 1/35.
 Similarly,  for the black-white sequence,  the probability of drawing a black ball first is 4/8,  then a white ball is 4/7,  then a black ball is 3/6,  and so on.  So the probability of this sequence is also 1/35.
 The total probability of alternating colors is the sum of the probabilities of the two sequences: 1/35 + 1/35 = 2/35.
 However,  the choices provided do not include 2/35,  so there may be an error in the choices.  Assuming the choices are correct,  the closest option is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: What is the smallest prime whose digits sum to $19 $?  Choices: a) 5  b) 11  c) 17  d) 199  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find a number whose digits sum to 19.  The smallest such number is 199,  since 1 + 9 + 9 = 19.
 Next,  I need to check if 199 is a prime number.  I can do this by checking if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root.
 The prime numbers less than the square root of 199 are 2,  3,  5,  7,  11,  13,  17,  and 19.
 199 is not divisible by any of these numbers,  so it is a prime number.
 Therefore,  the smallest prime whose digits sum to 19 is 199.

"Input: The domain of the function $h(x) = \sqrt{25 -x^2 }+\sqrt{-(x-2 )}$ is an interval of what width?  Choices: a) 7  b) 5  c) 2  d) 25  
 Output:
 First, I need to determine the domain of the function $h(x)$. The function involves square roots, so I need to consider the values of $x$ that make the expressions inside the square roots non-negative.

1. For $\sqrt{25 - x^2}$ to be defined, $25 - x^2 \geq 0$. Solving this inequality gives $x^2 \leq 25$, which means $-5 \leq x \leq 5$.

2. For $\sqrt{-(x-2)}$ to be defined, $-(x-2) \geq 0$. Solving this inequality gives $x-2 \leq 0$, which means $x \leq 2$.

Combining these two conditions, the domain of $h(x)$ is the intersection of the two intervals, which is $-5 \leq x \leq 2$.

The width of this interval is $2 - (-5) = 7$.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles.  The two piles had an equal number of pins.  He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.  John had 66  pins left.  How many pins did John originally have?  Choices: a) 792  b) 66  c) 396  d) 72  
 Output:
 First,  let's denote the number of pins in one pile as P.  Since the two piles are equal,  the total number of pins is 2P.
 Next,  John gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile,  which is (1/2) * (1/3) * P = P/6.
 After giving away P/6 pins,  John has 66  pins left,  which means he had 66  + P/6 pins in the pile.
 Since the two piles are equal,  the pile John gave his brother had 66  + P/6 pins,  and the other pile had 66  + P/6 pins as well.
 Therefore,  the total number of pins John originally had is (66  + P/6) + (66  + P/6) = 132  + 2P/6 = 132  + P/3.
 We know that the total number of pins is 2P,  so we can set up the equation 2P = 132  + P/3.
 Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction,  we get 6P = 396  + P.
 Simplifying,  we find that 5P = 396,  so P = 79.2.
 Since the number of pins must be a whole number,  we round up to the nearest whole number,  which is 79.
 Therefore,  the total number of pins John originally had is 2P = 2 * 79 = 158.
 However,  none of the given choices match this answer,  so there must be an error in the problem or the choices provided.

 Output:
 First,  I need to substitute $x = -2$ into the function $f(x)$.  So,  $f(-2) = 8 (-2)^3  - 6 (-2)^2  - 4 (-2) + 5$.
 Next,  I need to calculate the powers and the multiplications.  $(-2)^3 = -8$,  $(-2)^2 = 4$,  and $-4 (-2) = 8$.
 Now,  I can rewrite the function as $f(-2) = 8 (-8)  - 6 (4)  + 8 + 5$.
 Continue calculating the multiplications and additions: $8 (-8) = -64$,  $6 (4) = 24$,  and $-64 - 24 + 8 + 5 = -75$.
 Therefore,  the value of $f(-2)$ is -75.

"Input: As punishment for bad behavior during recess,  Mrs.  Busywork asked her class to multiply 10  by $\frac{1 }{3 }$ five times.  John,  however,  notices that it is possible to multiply 10  by a single fraction and still get the same answer as the other students.  What is this single fraction?  Choices: a) \\frac{1 }{27 } b) \\frac{1 }{68 } c) \\frac{1 }{3 } d) \\frac{1 }{243 } 
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the result of multiplying 10  by $\frac{1 }{3 }$ five times.  This is equivalent to $10 * (\frac{1 }{3 })^5$.
 Simplifying,  I get $10 * \frac{1 }{3^5} = 10 * \frac{1 }{243} = \frac{10 }{243}$.
 Now,  I need to find a single fraction that,  when multiplied by 10,  gives the same result as $\frac{10 }{243}$.
 This means I need to find a fraction that is equal to $\frac{10 }{243}$ divided by 10,  or $\frac{10 }{243} * \frac{1 }{10}$.
 Simplifying,  I get $\frac{10 }{243} * \frac{1 }{10} = \frac{1 }{243}$.

What is the smallest positive $a$ such that if the graph of $y=f\left(\frac x5 \right)$ is shifted $a$ units to the right,  then we know that the resulting graph is identical to the original graph of $y=f\left(\frac x5 \right)$?  Choices: a) 100  b) 4  c) 5  d) 20  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the property of the function $y=f(x)$.  If the graph is shifted $20$ units to the right,  it is identical to the original graph.  This means that the function has a period of $20$ units.

Next,  I need to consider the function $y=f\left(\frac x5 \right)$.  Since the argument of the function is divided by $5$,  the graph will be horizontally stretched by a factor of $5$.  This means that the period of the function $y=f\left(\frac x5 \right)$ will be $20$ units * $5$ = $100$ units.

Finally,  I need to find the smallest positive $a$ such that shifting the graph of $y=f\left(\frac x5 \right)$ $a$ units to the right results in a graph that is identical to the original graph.  Since the period of the function $y=f\left(\frac x5 \right)$ is $100$ units,  the smallest positive $a$ that satisfies this condition is $100$ units.

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider all possible combinations of the numerators and denominators.  There are 4  choices for the numerator and 4  choices for the denominator,  so there are 4  * 4  = 16  possible fractions.
 However,  I need to exclude any fractions that are equivalent to each other.  For example,  1/2  is equivalent to 2/4,  so I only count one of them.
 To find the unique numbers,  I can list all the possible fractions and eliminate any duplicates: 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6, 2/3, 2/4, 2/6, 3/4, 3/6, 4/6.
 There are 10  unique numbers in this list.

 First,  I need to determine the row number.  Since the row has 43  numbers,  it is the 42nd  row (row numbering starts from 0).
 Next,  I need to find the second number in the row.  The second number in each row of Pascal's triangle is the number of combinations of choosing 1 item from the row number,  which is represented by the formula C(n, 1) = n, where n is the row number.
 So,  the second number in the 42nd  row is C(42, 1) = 42.

"Input: Let $f(x)=\frac{(x-2 )^2 -9 }{3 }$.  The equation $y=f(x)$ is graphed,  and the $x$- and $y$-intercepts of the graph are connected to form a polygon.  What is the area of that polygon?  Choices: a) 5  b) \\frac{25 }{6 } c) \\frac{\\sqrt{2465 }{9 } d) 2  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the $x$-intercepts of the graph.  To do this,  I set $y=0$ and solve for $x$:
 $0=\frac{(x-2 )^2 -9 }{3 }$
 $0=(x-2 )^2 -9 $
 $9=(x-2 )^2 $
 $x-2 =\pm 3 $
 $x=5 $ or $x=-1 $
 So,  the $x$-intercepts are $(5,0)$ and $(-1,0)$.
 Next,  I need to find the $y$-intercept of the graph.  To do this,  I set $x=0$ and solve for $y$:
 $y=\frac{(0-2 )^2 -9 }{3 }$
 $y=\frac{4 -9 }{3 }$
 $y=\frac{-5 }{3 }$
 So,  the $y$-intercept is $(0,\frac{-5 }{3 })$.
 Now,  I have the three vertices of the polygon: $(5,0)$, $(-1,0)$, and $(0,\frac{-5 }{3 })$.
 To find the area of the polygon,  I can use the formula for the area of a triangle: $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$.
 The base of the triangle is the distance between the $x$-intercepts,  which is $5-(-1)=6$.
 The height of the triangle is the distance from the $y$-intercept to the $x$-axis,  which is $|\frac{-5 }{3 }|=\frac{5 }{3 }$.
 So,  the area of the polygon is $\frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times \frac{5 }{3 }=5$.

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the given equation.  It says that the base-$b$ logarithm of 343 is $-\frac{3 }{2 }$.  This means that $b^{-\frac{3 }{2 }} = 343$.
 To solve for $b$,  I need to make $b$ the base of an exponent.  Since 343 is a power of 7,  I can rewrite the equation as $b^{-\frac{3 }{2 }} = 7^3$.
 Now,  I can use the property of exponents that says $(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$.  Applying this to the equation,  I get $(b^{-\frac{3 }{2 }})^{-2} = (7^3)^{-2}$.
 Simplifying,  I have $b^3 = 7^{-6}$.
 Taking the cube root of both sides,  I get $b = 7^{-2}$.
 Rewriting $7^{-2}$ as $\frac{1}{7^2}$,  I get $b = \frac{1}{49}$.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to recall the triangle inequality theorem,  which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.
 Now,  I will check each option against this theorem.
 For option a) 4,  7,  I add 4  + 7  = 11,  which is greater than 10.  So,  this could be a valid triangle.
 For option b) 5,  5,  I add 5  + 5  = 10,  which is equal to 10.  So,  this could be a valid triangle.
 For option c) 3,  9,  I add 3  + 9  = 12,  which is greater than 10.  So,  this could be a valid triangle.
 For option d) 9,  8,  I add 9  + 8  = 17,  which is greater than 10.  So,  this could be a valid triangle.
 None of the options violate the triangle inequality theorem,  so none of them could NOT be the lengths of the other two sides.

 Output:
 First,  I need to use the fact that the product of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers.  So,  48 * x = 24 * 240,  where x is the other integer.
 Next,  I solve for x: x = (24 * 240) / 48.

 First,  I need to simplify the equation by expressing both sides with the same base.  Since 9  is 3 ^2,  I can rewrite the equation as $3 ^{x^2 +4 x+4 }=(3 ^2) ^{x+2 }$.
 Next,  I simplify the right side of the equation by using the exponent rule (a^m)^n=a^(m*n),  resulting in $3 ^{x^2 +4 x+4 }=3 ^{2(x+2)}$.
 Now,  since the bases are the same,  I can set the exponents equal to each other: $x^2 +4 x+4 =2 (x+2)$.
 I simplify the equation by distributing the 2  on the right side: $x^2 +4 x+4 =2 x+4$.
 To solve for $x$,  I need to move all terms to one side of the equation: $x^2 +4 x+4 -2 x-4 =0$.
 Simplifying further,  I get $x^2 +2 x=0$.
 Now,  I can factor out an $x$: $x(x+2)=0$.
 The possible values of $x$ are 0  and -2.
 To find the sum of all possible values of $x$,  I add them together: 0 + (-2) = -2.

 Output:
 First, I need to determine the growth rate constant. The bacteria triple in 10 hours, so the equation is 3 * 200 = 200 * e^(k * 10), where k is the growth rate constant.

 Next, I'll solve for k. Dividing both sides by 200, I get 3 = e^(k * 10). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, I get ln(3) = k * 10. Solving for k, I get k = ln(3) / 10.

 Now, I need to find the number of bacteria after 1 full day, which is 24 hours. Using the exponential growth formula, N = 200 * e^(k * t), where N is the number of bacteria, k is the growth rate constant, and t is the time in hours.

 Plugging in the values, I get N = 200 * e^((ln(3) / 10) * 24).

 To find the approximate number of bacteria, I'll calculate the value of N. N ≈ 200 * e^(2.1642) ≈ 200 * 8.67 ≈ 1734.

 Output:
 First, I need to understand the relationship between x and y. Since x and y are directly proportional, I can write the equation as x = ky, where k is the constant of proportionality.
 Next, I need to find the value of k using the given values of x and y. When x = 3 and y = 8, I can write the equation as 3 = k * 8.
 To find the value of k, I divide both sides of the equation by 8: k = 3 / 8 = 0.375.
 Now that I have the value of k, I can use it to find the value of x when y = 13. I write the equation as x = 0.375 * 13.
 To find the value of x, I multiply 0.375 by 13: x = 4.875.

 Output:
 First,  I will analyze the given function f (x) = x^3  + 2 x^2  – 9 x – 18.
 To determine the number of real solutions to f (x) = 0,  I can look at the degree of the polynomial and the leading coefficient.  Since the degree is 3 and the leading coefficient is 1,  there can be up to 3 real solutions.  However,  this does not guarantee that there are exactly 3 real solutions.  So,  option a) is not necessarily true.
 Next,  I will consider option b) f (x) ≥ –18 for all x ≥ 0.  To do this,  I can evaluate the function at x = 0 and see if the result is greater than or equal to -18.  f (0) = (0)^3 + 2(0)^2 - 9(0) - 18 = -18.  Since -18 ≥ -18,  option b) is true.
 Option c) is the negation of option b),  so it is not true.
 Finally,  I will consider option d) The function f (x) is decreasing for x ≤ –3.  To determine if the function is decreasing in this interval,  I can look at the derivative of the function.  The derivative of f (x) is f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 9.  To see if f (x) is decreasing for x ≤ –3,  I need to find where f'(x) < 0.  I can do this by solving the inequality 3x^2 + 4x - 9 < 0.  However,  this is a quadratic inequality and solving it would require more steps than necessary for this task.  Instead,  I can use the fact that the function is a cubic polynomial and its leadingThe correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

 First,  I need to determine the number of ants of each species on Day 0.  Since there are 30  ants in total and the problem doesn't specify how many are of each species, I'll assume that they are evenly distributed, so there are 15  ants of Species A and 15  ants of Species B.
 Next,  I need to calculate the number of ants of each species on Day 5.  For Species A, the number of ants doubles every day, so on Day 5, there are 15  * 2^5 = 15  * 32  = 480  ants of Species A.
 For Species B, the number of ants triples every day, so on Day 5, there are 15  * 3^5 = 15  * 243  = 3645  ants of Species B.
 The total number of ants on Day 5 is 3281, which matches the given information, so my calculations are correct.
 Therefore,  the number of ants of Species A on Day 5 is 480, which is not among the given choices.  There must be an error in the choices provided.

"Input: In the equation $|x-4 | -10  = 2 $,  what is the product of all possible values of $x$?  Choices: a) -8  b) 128  c) -128  d) 16  
 Output:
 First,  I need to isolate the absolute value term by adding 10  to both sides of the equation: $|x-4 | = 12 $.
 Next,  I can split the equation into two cases: $x-4 = 12 $ and $x-4 = -12 $.
 For the first case,  solving for $x$ gives $x = 16 $.
 For the second case,  solving for $x$ gives $x = -8 $.
 The product of all possible values of $x$ is $16  \cdot -8  = -128 $.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The mean of 7  numbers is 15.  When an 8 th number is added,  the mean decreases to 12.  What is the 8 th number?  Choices: a) –12  b) –9  c) 0  d) 8  
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate the sum of the original 7 numbers. Since the mean is 15, the sum is 7 * 15 = 105.
 Next, I need to calculate the new sum after adding the 8th number. Since the new mean is 12, the new sum is 8 * 12 = 96.
 To find the 8th number, I subtract the new sum from the original sum: 105 - 96 = 9.
 Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: If 3 ^(x – 3 ) + 10  = 19,  then x = Choices: a) 3  b) 4  c) 5  d) 6  
 Output:
 First,  I need to isolate the exponential term by subtracting 10  from both sides of the equation: 3 ^(x – 3 ) = 9.
 Next,  I need to simplify the right side of the equation by recognizing that 9  is 3 ^2 : 3 ^(x – 3 ) = 3 ^2.
 Now,  I can equate the exponents since the bases are the same: x – 3  = 2.
 To solve for x,  I add 3  to both sides of the equation: x = 5.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Suppose that $f(x)$ is a polynomial that has degree $6 $ and $g(x)$ is a polynomial that has degree $3 $.  If $h(x)$ is also a polynomial such that $f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $36 $,  then what is the degree of the polynomial $h$?  Choices: a) 72  b) 6  c) 18  d) 12  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the degrees of the polynomials involved.  Since $f(x)$ has degree $6 $,  the highest degree term in $f(g(x))$ will be the result of substituting $g(x)$ into $f(x)$.  Since $g(x)$ has degree $3 $,  the highest degree term in $g(x)$ will be multiplied by the highest degree term in $The degree of the polynomial h is 12.

"Input: A point $(x, y)$ is randomly picked from inside the rectangle with vertices $(0,0 )$,  $(3,0 )$,  $(3,2 )$,  and $(0,2 )$.  What is the probability that $x < y$?  Choices: a) \\frac{1 }{12 } b) \\frac{1 }{6 } c) \\frac{2 }{3 } d) \\frac{1 }{3 } 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the area of the rectangle.  The rectangle has a length of 3  units and a height of 2  units,  so the area is 3  * 2  = 6  square units.
 Next,  I need to find the region inside the rectangle where $x < y$.  This region is a triangle with vertices $(0,0 )$,  $(2,2 )$,  and $(3,2 )$.  The base of the triangle is 2  units and the height is 2  units,  so the area of the triangle is 0.5  * 2  * 2  = 2  square units.
 The probability that a randomly picked point satisfies $x < y$ is the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the rectangle: 2  ÷ 6  = 1  ÷ 3 .
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Roslyn has twenty boxes.  Thirteen of the boxes contain pencils,  nine of the boxes contain pens,  and three of the boxes contain neither pens nor pencils.  How many boxes contain both pens and pencils?  Choices: a) 5  b) 2  c) 13  d) 139  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the total number of boxes that contain either pens or pencils.  Since three boxes contain neither,  there are 20 - 3 = 17 boxes that contain either pens or pencils.
 Next,  I need to find the number of boxes that contain only pens,  only pencils,  or both.  The total number of boxes that contain pens is 13,  and the total number of boxes that contain pencils is 9.
 To find the number of boxes that contain both pens and pencils,  I subtract the total number of boxes that contain either pens or pencils from the sum of the boxes that contain only pens and the boxes that contain only pencils: 17 - (13 + 9) = 17 - 22 = -5.
 However,  this result doesn't make sense because the number of boxes cannot be negative.  This indicates that there is an overlap between the boxes that contain pens and the boxes that contain pencils.
 To find the overlap,  I add the total number of boxes that contain either pens or pencils to the sum of the boxes that contain only pens and the boxes that contain only pencils,  and then subtract the total number of boxes: 17 + (13 + 9) - 20 = 27 - 20 = 7.

"Input: How many positive 4 -digit integers have only odd digits?  Choices: a) 100  b) 999  c) 625  d) 500  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider that a 4 -digit number has the form ABCD,  where A,  B,  C,  and D are digits.
 Since the digits must be odd,  the possible values for each digit are 1,  3,  5,  7,  and 9.
 For the first digit A,  it cannot be 0,  so it has 5  possible values (1,  3,  5,  7,  9).
 For the second digit B,  it can be any of the 5  odd digits.
 For the third digit C,  it can also be any of the 5  odd digits.
 For the fourth digit D,  it can be any of the 5  odd digits.
 To find the total number of 4 -digit integers with only odd digits,  I multiply the number of possibilities for each digit: 5  * 5  * 5  * 5  = 625.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: What is $$\frac{-\frac{18 }{7 }}{-\frac{6 }{5 }}? $$ Choices: a) \\frac{7 }{15 } b) \\frac{15 }{7 } c) \\frac{15 }{8 } d) \\frac{15 }{11 } 
 Output:
 First, I need to simplify the expression by dividing the numerators and denominators separately. To do this, I multiply the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator. So, I have:

$$\frac{-\frac{18 }{7 }}{-\frac{6 }{5 }} = -\frac{18 }{7 } \cdot -\frac{5 }{6 }.$$

Next, I can simplify the expression by canceling out common factors in the numerator and denominator. In this case, both the 18 and 6 have a common factor of 6. So, I can simplify the expression as follows:

$$-\frac{18 }{7 } \cdot -\frac{5 }{6 } = -\frac{3 \cdot 6 }{7 } \cdot -\frac{5 }{1 \cdot 6 }.$$

Now, I can cancel out the common factor of 6 in the numerator and denominator:

$$-\frac{3 \cdot \cancel{6} }{7 } \cdot -\frac{5 }{1 \cdot \cancel{6} } = -\frac{3 \cdot 5 }{7 }.$$

Finally, I can multiply the remaining numbers to get the final answer:

$$-\frac{3 \cdot 5 }{7 } = -\frac{15 }{7 }.$$

However, the answer choices are positive fractions. To match the format of the answer choices, I can multiply the numerator and denominator by -1 to get a positive fraction:

$$-\frac{15 }{7 } = \frac{15 }{7 }.$$

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: The positive square root of 200  is what percent larger than the positive square root of 121?  Express your answer to the nearest whole number.  Choices: a) 29  b) 14  c) 27  d) 11  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the positive square root of 200.  The square root of 200  is approximately 14.14.
 Next,  I need to find the positive square root of 121.  The square root of 121  is exactly 11.
 Now,  I need to calculate the percentage difference between the two square roots.  To do this,  I subtract the smaller square root (11) from the larger square root (14.14),  which gives me 3.14.
 Then,  I divide this difference by the smaller square root (11),  which gives me 3.14 ÷ 11  ≈ 0.2854.
 To express this as a percentage,  I multiply by 100: 0.2854 * 100 ≈ 28.54.
 Rounding to the nearest whole number,  the positive square root of 200  is approximately 29% larger than the positive square root of 121.

"Input: If $(2 x + 3 y)^2  = 4 $ and $xy = -5 $,  what is the value of $4 x^2  + 9 y^2 $?  Choices: a) -5  b) 13  c) 64  d) 25  
 Output:
 First,  I need to expand the given equation $(2 x + 3 y)^2  = 4 $.  Expanding it gives $4 x^2  + 12 xy + 9 y^2  = 4 $.
 Next,  I can substitute $xy = -5 $ into the equation to simplify it.  This gives $4 x^2  - 60 + 9 y^2  = 4 $.
 Now,  I want to find the value of $4 x^2  + 9 y^2 $.  To do this,  I can add $60 $ to both sides of the equation to isolate $4 x^2  + 9 y^2 $.  This gives $4 x^2  + 9 y^2  = 4 + 60 $.
 Simplifying the right side gives $4 x^2  + 9 y^2  = 64 $.

"Input: A sequence of three real numbers forms an arithmetic progression with a first term of 9.  If 2  is added to the second term and 20  is added to the third term,  the three resulting numbers form a geometric progression.  What is the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression?  Choices: a) 2  b) 1  c) 9  d) 16  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the common difference of the arithmetic progression.  Let's call it 'd'.  The sequence is 9,  9 + d,  and 9 + 2d.
 Next,  I need to consider the geometric progression after adding 2  and 20  to the second and third terms,  respectively.  The new sequence is 9,  11 + d,  29 + 2d.
 To form a geometric progression,  the ratio between consecutive terms must be the same.  So,  I can set up the equation (11 + d) ÷ 9 = (29 + 2d) ÷ (11 + d).
 Cross-multiplying,  I get (11 + d)² = 9(29 + 2d).
 Expanding and simplifying,  I get d² - 46d + 100 = 0.
 Solving this quadratic equation,  I get d = 23 ± 13.
 The smallest possible value for d is 23 - 13 = 10.
 Now,  I need to find the third term of the geometric progression.  The third term is 29 + 2d = 29 + 2(10) = 49.

"Input: Which statement is true?  Choices: a) If f(x) is continuous at x = c,  then f′(c) exists.  b) If f′(c) = 0,  then f has a local maximum or minimum at (c,  f (c)).  c) If f′′(c) = 0,  then the graph of f has an inflection point at (c,  f (c)).  d) If f is differentiable at x = c,  then f is continuous at x = c.  
 Output:
 First,  I will analyze each statement.
 a) This statement says that if f(x) is continuous at x = c,  then f′(c) exists.  This is not true because a function can be continuous at a point but not differentiable there.  An example is the absolute value function f(x) = |x|,  which is continuous at x = 0 but not differentiable at that point.
 b) This statement says that if f′(c) = 0,  then f has a local maximum or minimum at (c,  f (c)).  This is not true because a derivative equal to zero is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a local extremum.  For example,  the function f(x) = x^3 has f′(0) = 0,  but x = 0 is not a local extremum.
 c) This statement says that if f′′(c) = 0,  then the graph of f has an inflection point at (c,  f (c)).  This is not true because a second derivative equal to zero is a necessary but not sufficient condition for an inflection point.  For example,  the function f(x) = x^4 has f′′(0) = 0,  but x = 0 is not an inflection point.
 d) This statement says that if f is differentiable at x = c,  then f is continuous at x = c.  This is true because differentiability implies continuity.  If a function is differentiable at a point,To solve this problem, let's analyze each statement step by step:

a) This statement claims that if f(x) is continuous at x = c, then f'(c) exists. This is not necessarily true because continuity does not guarantee differentiability. A function can be continuous at a point but not differentiable there. For example, the absolute value function f(x) = |x| is continuous at x = 0 but not differentiable at that point.

b) This statement suggests that if f'(c) = 0, then f has a local maximum or minimum at (c, f(c)). This is not always true because a derivative equal to zero is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a local extremum. For example, the function f(x) = x^3 has f'(0) = 0, but x = 0 is not a local extremum.

c) This statement claims that if f''(c) = 0, then the graph of f has an inflection point at (c, f(c)). This is not always true because a second derivative equal to zero is a necessary but not sufficient condition for an inflection point. For example, the function f(x) = x^4 has f''(0) = 0, but x = 0 is not an inflection point.

d) This statement asserts that if f is differentiable at x = c, then f is continuous at x = c. This is true because differentiability implies continuity. If a function is differentiable at a point, it must also be continuous at that point.

 First,  I need to substitute $2 \star x$ into the equation $a\star b = a^b-ab$.  So,  $2 \star x = 2^x-2x$.
 Next,  I need to set this equation equal to 22,  since $2 \star x = 22$.  So,  $2^x-2x = 22$.
 Now,  I need to solve for $x$.  This is a non-linear equation,  so I will try to find a solution by testing the given choices.
 If $x = 5$,  then $2^5-2*5 = 32-10 = 22$,  which is true.

"Input: February of 2011  has 28  days and March has 31  days.  On what day of the week will next month,  April,  begin?  Choices: a) Wednesday b) Thursday c) Friday d) Saturday 
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the total number of days from February 1, 2011,  to March 1,  2011.  February has 28  days,  so the total is 28  days.
 Next,  I need to determine the day of the week for March 1,  2011.  Since February 1,  2011 was a Wednesday,  and there are 28  days between the two dates,  March 1,  2011 will also be a Wednesday.
 Now,  I need to determine the day of the week for April 1,  2011.  Since March 1,  2011 is a Wednesday,  April 1,  2011 will be 31  days later.
 To find the day of the week,  I can use the formula (day of the week + number of days) % 7.  In this case,  (3 + 31) % 7 = 34 % 7 = 6.
 The day of the week for April 1,  2011 is 6 days after Wednesday,  which is a Thursday.

Choices: a) January 10 th b) January 21 st c) January 31 st d) February 10 th 
 Output:
 First, I need to determine how many days it takes for the number of people with the virus to reach 1,000. Since the number of people with the virus doubles every 3 days, I can calculate the number of days it takes for the virus to spread to the entire town by dividing the total population by the initial number of infected people and then taking the logarithm base 2 of the result. So, 1,000 / 10 = 100, and log2(100) = 6.64385618977... Since the virus doubles every 3 days, I need to round up to the nearest multiple of 3, which is 9 days.

Next, I need to determine the earliest date at which the entire town would be infected. Since there are 31 days in January, and it takes 9 days for the virus to spread to the entire town, the earliest date would be January 9th.

 25 ^2  mod 23  = 18
 25 ^3  mod 23  = 16
 25 ^4  mod 23  = 22
 25 ^5  mod 23  = 1
 25 ^6  mod 23  = 25
 25 ^7  mod 23  = 18
 25 ^8  mod 23  = 16
 25 ^9  mod 23  = 22
 25 ^10  mod 23  = 1
Notice that the remainders start repeating after the 5th power.  This means that the powers of 25  mod 23  have a cycle of length 4.

Now,  I need to find the remainder when 1059  is divided by 4.  1059  mod 4  = 3.

Since the cycle length is 4,  I can use the remainder to determine the position in the cycle for 1059.  The position is 3,  which corresponds to the 3rd power in the cycle.

Looking at the pattern,  the remainder for the 3rd power is 16.

Therefore,  the remainder when 25 ^1059  is divided by 23  is 16.

 First,  I need to combine the fractions.  Since they have the same denominator,  I can add the numerators: $\frac{k-3+3 k+1}{2}$.
 Simplifying the numerator,  I get $\frac{4 k-2}{2}$.
 Now,  I can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2: $\frac{2 k-1}{1}$.
 Finally,  I can rewrite the expression as $2 k-1+3 k+1$.
 Combining like terms,  I get $5 k$.

"Input: If a clock chimes every hour the same number of times as the hour it is (e. g.,  at 3  P. M.  it chimes 3  times) and once for every 15 -minute increment between hours (e. g.,  at 3 :15,  3 :30,  and 3 :45 ),  what will the total number of chimes be between 5 :10  and 7 :35  P. M.?  Choices: a) 3  b) 15  c) 18  d) 21  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the number of chimes for each hour from 5  to 7  inclusive.  At 5  P. M.,  the clock chimes 5  times.  At 6  P. M.,  the clock chimes 6  times.  At 7  P. M.,  the clock chimes 7  times.  So,  the total chimes for these hours is 5  + 6  + 7  = 18  chimes.
 Next,  I need to calculate the number of 15 -minute increments between 5 :10  and 7 :35.  From 5 :10  to 5 :15,  there is 1  increment.  From 5 :15  to 5 :30,  there is 1  increment.  From 5 :30  to 5 :45,  there is 1  increment.  From 5 :45  to 6 :00,  there is 1  increment.  From 6 :00  to 6 :15,  there is 1  increment.  From 6 :15  to 6 :30,  there is 1  increment.

"Input: An equilateral triangle has sides of 12  inches.  What is the approximate area of the triangle?  Choices: a) 62  b) 72  c) 84  d) 112  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the height of the equilateral triangle.  To do this,  I can use the Pythagorean theorem.  I'll draw a line from one vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side,  creating two right triangles.
 The base of each right triangle is half the length of the side of the equilateral triangle,  so it's 12  / 2  = 6  inches.
 The hypotenuse of each right triangle is the side of the equilateral triangle,  which is 12  inches.
 Using the Pythagorean theorem,  I can find the height (h) of the triangle: h^2 + 6^2 = 12^2.
 Simplifying,  I get h^2 + 36 = 144.
 Subtracting 36 from both sides,  I get h^2 = 108.
 Taking the square root of both sides,  I get h ≈ 10.39 inches.
 Now,  I can find the area of the equilateral triangle using the formula: Area = (base * height) / 2.
 Plugging in the values,  I get Area = (12 * 10.39) / 2 ≈ 62.34 square inches.

"Input: When the graph of a certain function $f(x)$ is shifted $2 $ units to the right and stretched vertically by a factor of $2 $ (meaning that all $y$-coordinates are doubled),  the resulting figure is identical to the original graph.  Given that $f(0 )=0.1 $,  what is $f(10 )$?  Choices: a) 0.01  b) 1  c) 32  d) 3.2  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the transformation described.  Shifting the graph $2 $ units to the right means that the function becomes $f(x-2)$.  Stretching it vertically by a factor of $2 $ means that the function becomes $2f(x-2)$.
 Since the resulting figure is identical to the original graph,  we have $f(x) = 2f(x-2)$.
 Now,  I can use this equation to find $f(10)$.  Starting with $f(0) = 0.1$,  I can substitute $x = 2$ into the equation to get $f(2) = 2f(0) = 2 * 0.1 = 0.2$.
 Continuing this process,  I can find $f(4) = 2f(2) = 2 * 0.2 = 0.4$,  $f(6) = 2f(4) = 2 * 0.4 = 0.8$,  and $f(8) = 2f(6) = 2 * 0.8 = 1.6$.
 Finally,  I can find $f(10) = 2f(8) = 2 * 1.6 = 3.2$.

 Output:
 First,  I need to find the value of $f(12)$.  Plugging in $x=12$ into the function $f(x)$,  I get $f(12)=\frac{1 +12}{1 -12}=\frac{13}{-12}=-1.0833$.
 Next,  I need to find the value of $g(f(12))$.  Plugging in $x=-1.0833$ into the function $g(x)$,  I get $g(f(12))=\frac{-2}{-1.0833+1}=\frac{-2}{-0.0833}=24$.
 Now,  I need to find the value of $f(g(f(12)))$.  Plugging in $x=24$ into the function $f(x)$,  I get $f(g(f(12)))=\frac{1 +24}{1 -24}=\frac{25}{-23}=-1.0870$.
 Continuing this process,  I apply the functions $f$ and $g$ alternately 8  times.  After 8  iterations,  I get the value $g(f(g(f(\dotsb g(f(12 )) \dotsb ))))=-1.0000$.

"Input: John noticed that the angle formed by the minute hand and hour hand on a standard 12 -hour clock was 110  degrees when he left home after 6  p. m. ; it was also 110  degrees when he returned after 6  p. m.  but before 7  p. m.  that same night.  If he left home for more than five minutes,  for how many minutes was he away?  Choices: a) 36  b) 40  c) 38  d) 43  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the time when John left and returned.  He left after 6  p. m.  and returned before 7  p. m.,  so the time range is from 6:00  p. m.  to 6:59  p. m.
 Next,  I need to find the angle formed by the hour and minute hands when John left.  At 6:00  p. m.,  the hour hand points directly at the 6,  and the minute hand points at the 12.  The angle between them is 180  degrees.
 Now,  I need to find the angle formed by the hour and minute hands when John returned.  Since the angle was 110  degrees,  the hour and minute hands must have moved.  The hour hand moves 30  degrees per hour and 0.5  degrees per minute,  while the minute hand moves 6  degrees per minute.
 Let's assume John was away for x  minutes.  During this time,  the hour hand moved 0.5x  degrees,  and the minute hand moved 6x  degrees.
 The difference in angles between the two positions is 180  - 110  = 70  degrees.  So,  the equation is 0.5x  - 6x  = 70.
 Simplifying the equation,  I get -5.5x  = 70.
 Dividing both sides by -5.5,  I get x  = -12.7272...
 Since John left for more than five minutes,  the negative result is not valid.  Therefore,  I need to find the next time the angle is 110  degrees after 6:00  p. m.  This occurs when the hour hand is at 11 and the minute hand is at 10.  The time is 6:20  p. m.,  which is 20  minutes after 6:00  p. m.
 So,  John was away for 20  minutes.

 Output:
 First,  I need to find the function $h(x)$ by substituting $g(x)$ into $f(x)$.  So,  $h(x)=f(g(x))=3(g(x))+4=3(2 x-3)+4=6 x-9+4=6 x-5$.
 To find the inverse of $h(x)$,  I need to switch $x$ and $y$ and solve for $y$.  So,  $x=6 y-5$.
 Now,  I need to solve for $y$.  Adding 5 to both sides gives $x+5=6 y$.
 Dividing both sides by 6 gives $y=\frac{x+5}{6}$.
 Therefore,  the inverse of $h(x)$ is $\frac{x+5}{6}$,  which corresponds to option c).

"Input: The base of a solid is the region bounded by x^2  = 4 y and the line y = 2,  and each plane section perpendicular to the y-axis is a square.  The volume of the solid is Choices: a) 8  b) 16  c) 20  d) 32  
 Output:
 First, I need to find the limits of integration for the variable x. The equation x^2 = 4y can be rewritten as x = ±2√y. Since the base of the solid is bounded by y = 2, the limits of integration for x are from -2√2 to 2√2.

Next, I need to find the side length of each square cross-section. The side length is equal to the difference in x-values, which is 2√2 - (-2√2) = 4√2.

Now, I need to find the area of each square cross-section. The area is equal to the side length squared, which is (4√2)^2 = 32.

To find the volume of the solid, I need to integrate the area of each square cross-section with respect to y. The limits of integration for y are from 0 to 2.

The volume is given by the integral ∫[0, 2] 32 dy.

Evaluating the integral, I get 32y | [0, 2] = 32(2) - 32(0) = 64.

However, since the solid is symmetric about the y-axis, I only calculated half of the volume. Therefore, I need to multiply the result by 2 to get the total volume: 64 * 2 = 128.

Express your answer as a common fraction.  Choices: a) \\frac{5 }{12 } b) \\frac{5 }{11 } c) \\frac{7 }{12 } d) \\frac{5 }{17 } 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the possible values for $a\cdot b$.  Since $a$ can be negative or positive,  and $b$ can also be negative or positive,  the product $a\cdot b$ will be positive if both $a$ and $b$ are positive or both are negative.
 Next,  I need to find the number of pairs $(a, b)$ that satisfy this condition.  For $a$,  there are 4  positive values (0, 1, 2, 3) and 3  negative values (-3, -2, -1).  For $b$,  there are 3  positive values (2, 3, 4) and 2  negative values (-2, -1).
 The pairs that satisfy the condition are: $(-3, -2), (-2, -2), (-1, -2), (-3, 2), (-2, 2), (-1, 2), (-3, 3), (-2, 3), (-1, 3), (-3, 4), (-2, 4), (-1, 4), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)$.  There are 19  such pairs.
 The total number of possible pairs $(a, b)$ is $6  \times 4  = 24$.
 The probability that the product $a\cdot b$ is positive is the ratio of the number of pairs that satisfy the condition to the total number of possible pairs: $\frac{19}{24}$.

 Output:
 First,  I need to find the Taylor polynomial for y = x^2 /3  around x = 8.  To do this,  I will use the formula for the Taylor series:

Taylor series: f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)/1! + f''(a)(x-a)^2/2! + f'''(a)(x-a)^3/3! + ...

Here,  f(x) = x^2 /3,  a = 8,  and we are interested in the (x – 8 )^2  term.

Next,  I will find the first few derivatives of f(x):

f'(x) = (2/3)x^(-1/3)
f''(x) = (-2/9)x^(-4/3)
f'''(x) = (8/27)x^(-7/3)

Now,  I will evaluate these derivatives at x = 8:

f(8) = 8^2 /3 = 64 /3
f'(8) = (2/3)(8^(-1/3)) = 1/3
f''(8) = (-2/9)(8^(-4/3)) = -1/18
f'''(8) = (8/27)(8^(-7/3)) = 1/54

The Taylor polynomial for y = x^2 /3  around x = 8  is:

T(x) = 64 /3 + (1/3)(x-8)/1! - (1/18)(x-8)^2/2! + (1/54)(x-8)^3/3! + ...

The coefficient of the (x – 8 )^2  term is -1/18.

"Input: What value of $N$ satisfies $\frac{4 ^{(3 ^3 )}}{(4 ^3 )^3 } = 2 ^N$?  Choices: a) 9  b) 27  c) 36  d) 34  
 Output:
 First, I need to simplify the left side of the equation. For the numerator, $4^{(3^3)}$, I calculate $3^3$ which is 27, so the numerator becomes $4^{27}$.
 For the denominator, $(4^3)^3$, I calculate $4^3$ which is 64, so the denominator becomes $64^3$. Since $64 = 4^3$, the denominator can be written as $(4^3)^3 = 4^{3*3} = 4^9$.
 Now the equation becomes $\frac{4^{27}}{4^9} = 2^N$.
 Using the property of exponents that $\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$, I simplify the left side to $4^{27-9} = 4^{18}$.
 Since $4 = 2^2$, I can rewrite $4^{18}$ as $(2^2)^{18} = 2^{2*18} = 2^{36}$.
 Therefore, the equation becomes $2^{36} = 2^N$.
 For the equation to hold true, $N$ must be equal to 36.

 Output:
 First,  I need to check each point against both inequalities.  I will start with point a) (– 2,  15 ).
 For the first inequality,  y > 9 x – 8,  I substitute x = – 2 and y = 15: 15 > 9 (– 2) – 8.

 Simplifying,  15 < 2 + 8,  which is 15 < 10.  This is false.
 Since the second inequality is not true for point a),  it is not a solution to both inequalities.

 Output:
 First,  I need to find the value of $x$ that makes $f(x) = 25 $.  Since $f(x) = 3 x^2 -2 $,  I set $3 x^2 -2 = 25 $ and solve for $x$.
 Adding 2 to both sides gives $3 x^2 = 27 $.
 Dividing by 3 gives $x^2 = 9 $.
 Taking the square root of both sides gives $x = \pm 3 $.
 So,  the possible values of $x$ are 3 and -3.
 Now,  I need to find $g(25)$ for each possible value of $x$.
 For $x = 3 $,  $g(f(3)) = g(25) = 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13 $.
 For $x = -3 $,  $g(f(-3)) = g(25) = (-3)^2 + (-3) + 1 = 9 - 3 + 1 = 7 $.

 Output:
 First, I need to find the prime factors of 54,321. To do this, I can start by dividing by the smallest prime number, 2. However, 54,321 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2. The next smallest prime number is 3. Dividing 54,321 by 3, I get 18,107. Since 18,107 is a prime number, I have found the prime factorization of 54,321: 3 * 18,107.

Next, I need to find the largest factor of 54,321 that is less than 54,321. Since the prime factorization is 3 * 18,107, the largest factor less than 54,321 is the second largest prime factor, which is 18,107.

"Input: The hypotenuse of a right triangle measures 10  inches and one angle is $45 ^{\circ}$.  What is the number of square inches in the area of the triangle?  Choices: a) 10  b) 45  c) 125  d) 25  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.  Since one angle is $45 ^{\circ}$,  the triangle is an isosceles right triangle,  meaning the two legs are equal in length.
 Let's call the length of each leg $x$.  According to the Pythagorean theorem,  the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse.  So,  $x^2 + x^2 = 10^2$.
 Simplifying,  I get $2x^2 = 100$.  Dividing both sides by 2,  I get $x^2 = 50$.  Taking the square root of both sides,  I get $x = \sqrt{50}$.
 Now that I have the length of the legs,  I can calculate the area of the triangle.  The area of a triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$.  In this case,  the base and height are both $\sqrt{50}$,  so the area is $\frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{50} \times \sqrt{50}$.

 Now,  for each chosen tens digit,  I need to choose a different units digit from the remaining numbers.  For the first tens digit,  there are 10  options (20-29).  For the second tens digit,  there are 9  options (excluding the units digits already chosen).  For the third tens digit,  there are 8  options,  and so on.  So,  the number of ways to choose a different units digit for each tens digit is 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 = 30,240.
 Therefore,  the total number of ways to choose 5  different integers with each having a different tens digit is 1 * 30,240 = 30,240.
 To find the probability,  I divide the number of ways with different tens digits by the total number of ways: 30,240 / 2,118,760 = 2500 / 52969.

"Input: If $f(x) = 2 $ for all real numbers $x$,  what is the value of $f(x + 2 )$?  Choices: a) 2  b) 4  c) 0  d) 1  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the expression for $f(x + 2)$.  Since $f(x) = 2$ for all real numbers $x$,  we can substitute $x + 2$ into the function: $f(x + 2) = 2$.
 Therefore,  the value of $f(x + 2)$ is 2.

"Input: How many of the 401  integers from $-200 $ to $200 $ are congruent to $5  \pmod{13 }? $ Choices: a) 30  b) 31  c) 60  d) 45  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the smallest and largest numbers in the given range that are congruent to 5  modulo 13.
 The smallest number greater than or equal to -200 that is congruent to 5  modulo 13 is -200 + (13 - (-200 % 13)) = -200 + (13 - 3) = -186.
 The largest number less than or equal to 200 that is congruent to 5  modulo 13 is 200 - (200 % 13) = 200 - 10 = 190.
 Now,  I need to count how many numbers are in the range -186 to 190 that are congruent to 5  modulo 13.
 The numbers in this range that are congruent to 5  modulo 13 are -186, -173, -160, ..., 187, 190.
 I can find the number of terms in this arithmetic sequence by using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, n is the number of terms, and d is the common difference.
 In this case, a_1 = -186, a_n = 190, and d = 13.
 Solving for n, I get n = (a_n - a_1) / d + 1 = (190 - (-186)) / 13 + 1 = 376 / 13 + 1 = 28 + 1 = 29.
 Therefore,  there are 29 numbers in the given range that are congruent to 5  modulo 13.

"Input: What is the least possible positive integer-value of $n$ such that $\sqrt{18 \cdot n \cdot 34 }$ is an integer?  Choices: a) 34  b) 2  c) 17  d) 3  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the prime factorization of 18 and 34.  The prime factorization of 18 is $2 \cdot 3^2$,  and the prime factorization of 34 is $2 \cdot 17$.
 Now,  I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 34.  The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved,  so the LCM of 18 and 34 is $2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 17$.
 To make $\sqrt{18 \cdot n \cdot 34 }$ an integer,  $n$ must be a factor of the LCM.  The smallest positive integer-value of $n$ is the smallest prime factor of the LCM,  which is 2.

"Input: If f(2 x) = x + 5  and f(g(6 )) = 13,  then 2  * g(6 ) = Choices: a) 6  b) 16  c) 32  d) 36  
 Output:
 First,  I notice that f(g(6 )) = 13.  This means that g(6 ) must be a value that,  when plugged into the function f,  gives a result of 13.
 Next,  I look at the function f(2 x) = x + 5.  I can rewrite this as f(u) = (u/2) + 5,  where u = 2x.
 Now,  I need to find a value for u that,  when divided by 2,  and 5 is added,  gives a result of 13.  So,  (u/2) + 5 = 13.
 Subtracting 5 from both sides,  I get u/2 = 8.
 Multiplying both sides by 2,  I get u = 16.
 This means that g(6 ) = 16,  since plugging 16 into the function f gives a result of 13.
 Finally,  I need to find 2 * g(6 ).  Since g(6 ) = 16,  2 * g(6 ) = 2 * 16 = 32.

"Input: Express as a common fraction the reciprocal of $0. \overline7 $.  Choices: a) \\frac{7 }{2 } b) \\frac{7 }{9 } c) \\frac{9 }{2 } d) \\frac{9 }{7 } 
 Output:
 First,  let's denote $0. \overline7 $ as $x$.  Then,  multiplying both sides of $x=0. \overline7 $ by 10,  we get $10x=7. \overline7 $.
 Subtracting the original equation $x=0. \overline7 $ from the equation $10x=7. \overline7 $,  we get $9x=7$.
 Dividing both sides by 9,  we find that $x=\frac{7}{9}$.
 The reciprocal of $x$ is $\frac{1}{x}$,  so the reciprocal of $\frac{7}{9}$ is $\frac{9}{7}$.

 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the distance of each half of the race.  Since the total race is 26.2 miles,  each half is 26.2  ÷ 2  = 13.1  miles.
 Next,  I need to calculate the time it takes for Jennifer to run each half of the race.  For the first half at 8  mph,  the time is 13.1  ÷ 8  = 1.64  hours.
 For the second half at 6  mph,  the time is 13.1  ÷ 6  = 2.18  hours.
 The total time to complete the race is 1.64  + 2.18  = 3.82  hours.

 a) 300: 300 is not a perfect square.
 b) 9: 9 is a perfect square (3^2).
 c) 900: 900 is a perfect square (30^2).

 First,  I need to find the value of $ab$.  Since $a=7 $ and $b=13 $,  we have $ab=7*13=91$.
 Next,  I need to find the even positive integers less than 91.  The smallest even positive integer is 2,  and the largest even positive integer less than 91 is 90.
 To find the number of even positive integers in this range,  I can divide the difference between the largest and smallest even positive integers by 2 and add 1.  So,  (90-2)/2 + 1 = 45.

 Output:
 First,  I need to find the relationship between $a, $b, and $c$.  From the given equations,  I can rewrite them as $b = a^2,  c = b^2 /2,  a = c^2 /3 $.
 Next,  I can substitute $b$ in terms of $a$ into the equation for $c$: $c = (a^2)^2 /2 = a^4 /2 $.
 Now,  I can substitute $c$ in terms of $a$ into the equation for $a$: $a = (a^4 /2)^2 /3 = a^8 /12 $.
 To solve for $a$,  I can multiply both sides by 12 and then take the 8th root: $a^8 = 12a$.
 Dividing both sides by $a$,  I get $a^7 = 12$.
 Taking the 7th root of both sides,  I find $a = 12^(1 /7)$.

"Input: Solve for $x$:$$\left(\frac{1 }{25 }\right)^{x + 2 } = 125 ^{-x}. $$ Choices: a) 1  b) 2  c) 3  d) 4  
 Output:
 First,  I need to express all the bases as powers of the same number.  The base of the left side of the equation is 1/25,  which is the same as 5^{-2}.  So,  the left side can be written as (5^{-2})^{x + 2} = 5^{-2x - 4}.
 The base of the right side of the equation is 125,  which is the same as 5^3.  So,  the right side can be written as (5^3)^{-x} = 5^{-3x}.
 Now,  the equation becomes 5^{-2x - 4} = 5^{-3x}.
 Since the bases are the same,  I can set the exponents equal to each other: -2x - 4 = -3x.
 To solve for x,  I need to isolate x.  I can add 3x to both sides of the equation: x - 4 = 0.
 Then,  I can add 4 to both sides of the equation: x = 4.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The circle $2 x^2  = -2 y^2  + 12 x - 4 y + 20 $ is inscribed inside a square which has a pair of sides parallel to the x-axis.  What is the area of the square?  Choices: a) 80  b) \\sqrt{20 } c) 2 \\sqrt{20 } d) 20  
 Output:
 First,  I need to rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form to identify its center and radius.  The given equation is $2 x^2  = -2 y^2  + 12 x - 4 y + 20 $.  Dividing by 2,  we get $x^2  = -y^2  + 6 x - 2 y + 10 $.
 Completing the square for both x and y,  we add $(6/2)^2  = 9$ to both sides for x and $(-2/2)^2  = 1$ to both sides for y,  resulting in $x^2  + 6 x + 9 - y^2  - 2 y - 1 = 8$.
 Simplifying,  we get $(x + 3)^2  - (y + 1)^2  = 8$.
 This is the standard form of a circle with center $(-3, -1)$ and radius $\sqrt{8}$.

Next,  since the square has sides parallel to the x-axis and contains the circle,  the side length of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle,  which is $2 \sqrt{8}$.

Finally,  the area of the square is the side length squared: $(2 \sqrt{8})^2  = 4 * 8 = 32$.

However,  the given choices do not include 32.  There might be an error in the choices provided.  Based on the calculation,  the correct answer is {'sol': '32'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the pattern of the series.  Each term in the series is of the form \[\frac{k}{2^k}\],  where k is a positive integer.
 Next,  I will try to find a pattern by calculating the first few terms of the series:
 \[\frac{1}{2^1} + \frac{2}{2^2} + \frac{3}{2^3} + \cdots\]
 \[= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{4} + \frac{3}{8} + \cdots\]
 \[= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{8} + \cdots\]
 I notice that each term can be written as \[\frac{k}{2^k} = \frac{k-1}{2^{k-1}} - \frac{k}{2^k}\].
 Now,  I will use this pattern to simplify the series:
 \[\frac{1}{2^1} + \frac{2}{2^2} + \frac{3}{2^3} + \cdots\]
 \[= \left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{2}{4}\right) + \left(\frac{2}{4} - \frac{3}{8}\right) + \left(\frac{3}{8} - \frac{4}{16}\right) + \cdots\]
 \[= \frac{1}{2} - \lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{k}{2^k}\]
 Since the limit of \[\frac{k}{2^k}\] as k approaches infinity is 0,  the series simplifies to \[\frac{1}{2}\].
 Therefore,  the sum of the series is 1,  and the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

 The probability that a randomly selected point lies within the unit sphere is the ratio of the volume of the unit sphere to the volume of the cube: $\frac{\frac{4}{3} \pi}{8} = \frac{\pi}{6}$.

 First, I need to find the cube root of $x$. Since $x = 2^{15} \cdot 3^6$, I can rewrite this as $(2^5)^3 \cdot (3^2)^3$. 
Next, I can simplify this expression by multiplying the exponents: $(2^5)^3 \cdot (3^2)^3 = 2^{15} \cdot 3^6$. 
Now, to find the cube root of $x$, I can take the cube root of each term: $\sqrt[3]{2^{15} \cdot 3^6} = 2^5 \cdot 3^2$. 
Finally, I can calculate the value of $2^5 \cdot 3^2$: $2^5 \cdot 3^2 = 32 \cdot 9 = 288$.

 Output:
 First,  I notice that the expression $(a+b+c)^3  - a^3  - b^3  - c^3$ can be simplified using the identity $(a+b+c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)$.  So,  the expression becomes $3(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)$.
 Next,  I need to find the value of $a+b+c$ given that $3(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = 150$.  To simplify the problem,  I can divide both sides of the equation by 3,  resulting in $(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = 50$.
 Now,  I need to find three positive integers $a, b, $ and $c$ that satisfy the equation $(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = 50$.  I can start by considering the prime factorization of 50,  which is $2 * 5^2$.
 To find the possible values of $a, b, $ and $c$,  I can assign the factors of 50 to the variables in different ways.  For example,  I can set $a+b=2$,  $b+c=5$,  and $c+a=5$.  Solving this system of equations,  I find that $a=1$,  $b=1$,  and $c=3$.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is $a+b+c = 1+1+3 = 5$.  However,  this answer is not among the choices.  I need to check if there are other possible combinations of $a, b, $ and $c$ that satisfy the equation.

 Therefore,  the correct answer is $a+b+c = 1+1+23 = 25$.  This answer is also not among the choices.  I need to check if there are other possible combinations of $a, b, $ and $c$ that satisfy theThe answer is: 25{'sol': '25'}"

 Next,  I need to find the decrease in cases per year from 1960  to 1996.  The difference in cases is 450,000 - 500 = 449,500  cases.
 To find the decrease per year,  I divide the total decrease by the number of years: 449,500  cases ÷ 36  years = 12,486.67  cases per year.
 Now,  I need to calculate the number of years between 1960  and 1987.  The difference is 1987 - 1960 = 27  years.
 To find the number of cases reported in 1987,  I subtract the total decrease over those years from the 1960  cases: 450,000  - (12,486.67  * 27) = 450,000  - 337,127.03 = 112,872.97.

 First,  I need to simplify the expression $(x\sqrt{x^3 })^4 $.  To do this,  I can rewrite the square root as a fractional exponent: $\sqrt{x^3 } = (x^3 )^{1/2}$.
 Next,  I can apply the power of a power rule: $(x\sqrt{x^3 })^4 = (x(x^3 )^{1/2})^4$.
 Now,  I can simplify the expression inside the parentheses: $(x(x^3 )^{1/2})^4 = (x(x^{3/2}))^4$.
 Using the product rule of exponents,  I can combine the exponents: $(x(x^{3/2}))^4 = (x^{1+3/2})^4$.
 Simplifying the exponent inside the parentheses: $(x^{1+3/2})^4 = (x^{5/2})^4$.
 Finally,  I can apply the power of a power rule again: $(x^{5/2})^4 = x^{(5/2)*4}$.
 Simplifying the exponent: $x^{(5/2)*4} = x^{10}$.
 Therefore,  the simplified expression is $x^{10}$,  and the exponent of $x$ is 10.

 First,  I need to calculate the total number of ways to choose 3  cards from a 52 -card deck.  This can be done using combinations: C(52, 3) = 52! / (3! * (52-3)!) = 22,100.
 Next,  I need to calculate the number of ways to choose a pair.  There are 13 ranks in a standard deck,  and for each rank,  there are 4 cards (one for each suit).  So,  there are 13 ways to choose the rank of the pair,  and for each rank,  there are 6 ways to choose the two cards of that rank (since there are 4 cards of each rank and we are choosing 2).  Then,  there are 48 remaining cards to choose from for the third card,  since we have already chosen 2 cards.  So,  the total number of ways to choose a pair is 13 * 6 * 48 = 3,744.
 The probability of choosing a pair is the number of ways to choose a pair divided by the total number of ways to choose 3 cards: 3,744 / 22,100 = 0.1694.
 To express this as a fraction,  I can simplify the fraction 3,744 / 22,100 to 72 / 425.

 Now,  I can use the formula for the length of a curve between two x-values: L = integral from a to b of sqrt(1 + (y')^2) dx, where a and b are the x-values.
 In this case,  a = e^(1/2) and b = e^1.  So,  I need to evaluate the integral L = integral from e^(1/2) to e^1 of sqrt(1 + (1/x)^2) dx.
 To solve this integral,  I can simplify the expression inside the square root: sqrt(1 + (1/x)^2) = sqrt(1 + 1/x^2) = sqrt((x^2 + 1)/x^2) = sqrt(x^2 + 1)/x.
 Now,  I can rewrite the integral as L = integral from e^(1/2) to e^1 of (sqrt(x^2 + 1)/x) dx.
 To solve this integral,  I can use a substitution.  Let u = x^2 + 1,  then du = 2x dx,  and dx = du/2x.
 The integral becomes L = integral from e^(1/2) to e^1 of (sqrt(u)/x) * (du/2x) = integral from e^(1/2) to e^1 of (sqrt(u)/(2x^2)) du.
 Now,  I can substitute back for u: L = integral from e^(1/2) to e^1 of (sqrt(u)/(2(u-1))) du.
 This integral can be solved using integration by parts or a table of integrals.  The result is L = 0.86.

"Input: Find the area of the first quadrant region bounded by y = x^2,  y = cos(x),  and the y-axis.  Choices: a) 0.292  b) 0.508  c) 0.547  d) 0.667  
 Output:
 First, I need to find the points of intersection between y = x^2 and y = cos(x). To do this, I set the two equations equal to each other: x^2 = cos(x). This is a transcendental equation and cannot be solved algebraically, so I will need to use numerical methods or a graphing calculator to find the approximate intersection point. Let's assume the intersection point is at x ≈ 0.865.

Next, I need to find the area between the curves from x = 0 to the intersection point. To do this, I will integrate the difference between the two functions over this interval: ∫(cos(x) - x^2)dx from 0 to 0.865.

Now, I will evaluate the integral: ∫(cos(x) - x^2)dx = sin(x) - (1/3)x^3 + C.

To find the area, I will evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds of integration: [sin(0.865) - (1/3)(0.865)^3] - [sin(0) - (1/3)(0)^3].

Calculating this, the area is approximately 0.508.

 First,  I need to consider what it means for a number to be a multiple of $12 $.  A number is a multiple of $12 $ if it can be divided by $12 $ without leaving a remainder.
 Next,  I need to consider the positive and negative integers separately.  For positive integers,  I can simply divide $12 $ by any positive integer and see if the result is an integer.  For negative integers,  I can do the same,  but the result will be negative.
 I will start with positive integers.  $12 $ is a multiple of $12 $,  $6 $,  $4 $,  and $3 $,  since $12 ÷ 12 = 1 $,  $12 ÷ 6 = 2 $,  $12 ÷ 4 = 3 $,  and $12 3."

"Input: Rewrite the expression $6 j^2  - 4 j + 12 $ in the form $c(j + p)^2  + q$,  where $c$,  $p$,  and $q$ are constants.  What is $\frac{q}{p}$?  Choices: a) 3  b) -34  c) -38  d) 11  
 Output:
 First,  I need to complete the square for the expression $6 j^2  - 4 j + 12 $.  To do this,  I will rewrite the expression in the form $c(j + p)^2  + q$.
 I start by factoring out the coefficient of $j^2$,  which is 6: $6(j^2  - \frac{2}{3} j) + 12$.
 Next,  I need to find the value of $p$.  To do this,  I take half of the coefficient of $j$,  which is $-\frac{2}{3}$,  and divide it by the coefficient of $j^2$,  which is 6.  So,  $p = -\frac{1}{3}$.
 Now,  I need to add and subtract $(\frac{1}{3})^2$ inside the parentheses to complete the square: $6(j^2  - \frac{2}{3} j + (\frac{1}{3})^2 - (\frac{1}{3})^2) + 12$.
 This simplifies to $6((j - \frac{1}{3})^2 - \frac{1}{9}) + 12$.
 Now,  I distribute the 6 and simplify: $6(j - \frac{1}{3})^2 - 6(\frac{1}{9}) + 12$.
 This further simplifies to $6(j - \frac{1}{3})^2 - \frac{2}{3} + 12$.
 Finally,  I combine the constant terms: $6(j - \frac{1}{3})^2 + \frac{34}{3}$.
 So,  the expression is in the form $c(j + p)^2  + q$,  with $c = 6$,  $p = -\frac{1}{3}$,  and $q = \frac{34}{3}$.
 Now,  I need to find $\frac{q}{p}$.  Since $q = \frac{34}{3}$ and $p = -\frac{1}{3}$,  I have $\frac{q}{p} = \frac{\frac{34}{3}}{-\frac{1}{3}}$.
 Simplifying,  I get $\frac{q}{p} = -34$.

 Output:
 First,  I need to use the given conditions to find a pattern or formula for the operation $\#$.  From the first condition,  I know that $r\ \#\ 0  = r$,  which means that any number $\#$ 0 is just the number itself.
 Next,  I use the second condition,  which states that $r\ \#\ s = s\ \#\ r$.  This means that the operation $\#$ is commutative,  so the order of the operands does not matter.
 Now,  I use the third condition,  which states that $(r + 1 )\ \#\ s = (r\ \#\ s) + s + 1 $.  I can rewrite this as $r\ \#\ s + s + 1  = (r\ \#\ s) + s + 1 $.
 To find $11 \ \#\ 5 $,  I can use the commutative property and rewrite it as $5 \ \#\ 11 $.
 I can then use the third condition to find a pattern.  Starting with $5 \ \#\ 11 $,  I can rewrite it as $(4 \ \#\ 11) + 11 + 1 $.
 Continuing this process,  I get:

"Input: A novel has 400  pages and Veronica wants to estimate how long it will take her to complete it.  She reads 250  words per minute.  She counted the words on one quarter of a typical page and found that there were approximately 200  words per page.  To the nearest minute,  how long will it take Veronica to read the book?  Choices: a) 225  b) 320  c) 400  d) 450  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the total number of words in the novel.  Since one quarter of a page has approximately 200  words,  a full page has 200  * 4  = 800  words.
 The novel has 400  pages,  so the total number of words is 400  * 800  = 320,000  words.
 Next,  I need to calculate how long it will take Veronica to read the book.  She reads 250  words per minute,  so to read 320,000  words,  it will take her 320,000  ÷ 250  = 1,280  minutes.
 To the nearest minute,  it will take Veronica 1,280  minutes to read the book.

What would a Christmas shopper in December pay for the coat in dollars?  Choices: a) $227.50  b) $234.00  c) $286.00  d) $290.00  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the price after the first markdown in November.  The coat is marked down 20  percent,  so the discount is 325.00  * 0.20  = 65.00  dollars.
 The price after the first markdown is 325.00  - 65.00  = 260.00  dollars.
 Next,  I need to calculate the price after the second markdown in December.  The coat is marked down an additional 10  percent,  so the discount is 260.00  * 0.10  = 26.00  dollars.
 The price after the second markdown is 260.00  - 26.00  = 234.00  dollars.

"Input: John is playing a game in which he tries to obtain the highest number possible.  He must put the symbols +,  $\times$,  and - (plus,  times,  and minus) in the following blanks,  using each symbol exactly once:\[2  \underline{\hphantom{8 }} 4  \underline{\hphantom{8 }} 6  \underline{\hphantom{8 }} 8. \] John cannot use parentheses or rearrange the numbers.  What is the highest possible number that John could obtain?  Choices: a) 22  b) 46  c) 100  d) 99  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the order of the symbols to maximize the result.  Since the goal is to obtain the highest number,  I should prioritize operations that result in larger numbers.  The multiplication operation ($\times$) will yield the largest result when applied to the highest possible numbers.

Next,  I will place the multiplication symbol between the largest numbers available,  which are 6 and 8.  This gives me the expression: \[2  \underline{\hphantom{8 }} 4  \underline{\hphantom{8 }} 6  \times  8.\]

Now,  I need to decide between the plus and minus operations for the remaining blanks.  To maximize the result,  I should use the plus operation between the remaining numbers,  2 and 4, as it will result in a larger sum than the difference.

So,  the final expression is: \[2  +  4  \times  6  \times  8.\]

To find the highest possible number,  I perform the operations in the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right).

First,  I do the multiplication: \[4  \times  6  = 24.\]
Then,  I multiply the result by 8: \[24  \times  8  = 192.\]
Finally,  I add 2: \[192  +  2  = 194.\]

Therefore,  the highest possible number John could obtain is 194, which is not among the given choices. There might be a mistake in the question or the choices provided.."
"Input: Eighty-five more than the square of a number is the same as the square of the quantity that is $17 $ less than the number.  What is the number?  Choices: a) 17  b) 6  c) 2  d) 11  
 Output:
 First,  let's represent the number with the variable x.  The problem states that 85  more than the square of x is equal to the square of (x - 17).
 This can be written as an equation: x^2 + 85  = (x - 17)^2.
 To solve for x,  I will expand the right side of the equation: x^2 + 85  = x^2 - 34x + 289.
 Next,  I will simplify the equation by subtracting x^2 from both sides: 85  = -34x + 289.
 Now,  I will subtract 85 from both sides to isolate the term with x: 0  = -34x + 204.
 To solve for x,  I will divide both sides by -34: x = 6.

 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the sum of the interior angles of a regular octagon.  A regular octagon has 8  sides,  so the sum of the interior angles is (8 - 2) * 180  = 6 * 180  = 1080  degrees.
 Next,  since the octagon is regular,  all interior angles are equal.  To find the measure of one angle,  I divide the sum of the angles by the number of angles: 1080  ÷ 8  = 135  degrees.

 First,  I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the three numbers: 360,  450,  and 540.
 To do this,  I can find the prime factors of each number: 360 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5,  450 = 2 * 3^2 * 5^2,  and 540 = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5.
 Next,  I take the highest power of each prime factor found in the three numbers: 2^3,  3^3,  and 5^2.
 Now,  I multiply these together to get the LCM: 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^2 = 8 * 27 * 25 = 5400.

 First,  I need to calculate the magnitude of the vector v = (5,  0,  7 ).
 The magnitude of a vector in three-dimensional space is calculated using the formula: magnitude = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2), where x, y, and z are the components of the vector.
 In this case,  x = 5,  y = 0,  and z = 7.
 So,  the magnitude is sqrt(5^2 + 0^2 + 7^2) = sqrt(25 + 0 + 49) = sqrt(74).
 The magnitude of the vector v is approximately 8.6.

"Input: If we take sin x and change it to 3  sin 2 x,  what will happen to the domain and range of the function?  Choices: a) Domain and range remain the same b) Domain is double; range remains the same c) Domain is tripled; range is doubled d) Domain is the same; range is tripled 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the domain of the function. The original function is sin x, which is defined for all real numbers x. When we change it to 3 sin 2x, the argument of the sine function is multiplied by 2. This does not affect the domain, as the sine function is still defined for all real numbers x. Therefore, the domain remains the same.

Next, let's consider the range of the function. The range of the sine function is [-1, 1]. When we multiply the sine function by 3, the range is stretched vertically by a factor of 3. However, since the maximum and minimum values of the sine function are both multiplied by 3, the range remains [-3, 3], which is still within the original range of [-1, 1]. Therefore, the range is also the same.

 The largest number is 10,  and the smallest number is $\frac{2}{5}$.
 To find the greatest possible quotient,  I need to divide the largest number by the smallest number: $\frac{10}{\frac{2}{5}}$.

 For y = 1, we have x^2 = 1, which gives us x = ±1.
 For y = 9, we have x^2 = 9, which gives us x = ±3.
 Now, I will integrate the function y = x^2 between the limits x = -1 and x = 1 to find the area under the parabola from y = 0 to y = 1.
 The integral of x^2 with respect to x is (x^3)/3, so the area under the parabola from y = 0 to y = 1 is [(1^3)/3 - (-1^3)/3] = (1/3 + 1/3) = 2/3.
 Next, I will integrate the function y = x^2 between the limits x = 1 and x = 3 to find the area under the parabola from y = 1 to y = 9.

 Now,  I need to calculate the probability that all three points are within a semicircle.  If the first point is chosen randomly,  it doesn't matter where it is,  so the probability is 1.  The second point must be within a distance equal to the radius of the circle from the first point.  The probability of this happening is 1/2,  since there are two semicircles of equal length.  The third point must be within a distance equal to the radius of the circle from both the first and second points.  The probability of this happening is 1/4,  since there are four quarter circles of equal length.
 The probability that all three points are within a semicircle is the product of the probabilities for each point: 1 * 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8.

"Input: If we express $3 x^2  + x - 4 $ in the form $a(x - h)^2  + k$,  then what is $k$?  Choices: a) -\\frac{7 }{12 } b) -7  c) 49  d) -\\frac{49 }{12 } 
 Output:
 First,  I need to complete the square for the quadratic expression $3 x^2  + x - 4 $.  To do this,  I will factor out the leading coefficient,  which is 3: $3(x^2  + \\frac{1}{3}x) - 4 $.
 Next,  I need to find the value that completes the square for the expression inside the parentheses.  This value is half of the coefficient of the x term,  squared.  In this case,  the coefficient of the x term is $\\frac{1}{3}$,  so half of it is $\\frac{1}{6}$,  and squaring it gives me $\\frac{1}{36}$.
 I need to add and subtract this value inside the parentheses to maintain the equality: $3(x^2  + \\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{1}{36} - \\frac{1}{36}) - 4 $.
 Now,  I can rewrite the expression inside the parentheses as a perfect square: $3((x + \\frac{1}{6})^2  - \\frac{1}{36}) - 4 $.
 Next,  I will distribute the 3: $3(x + \\frac{1}{6})^2  - 3(\\frac{1}{36}) - 4 $.
 Now,  I will simplify the constants: $3(x + \\frac{1}{6})^2  - \\frac{1}{12} - 4 $.
 Finally,  I will combine the constants: $3(x + \\frac{1}{6})^2  - \\frac{49}{12} $.
 Comparing this expression to the given form $a(x - h)^2  + k$,  I can see that $k = -\\frac{49}{12}$.

"Input: At noon,  an experimenter has 50  grams of a radioactive isotope.  At noon 9  days later only 45  grams remain.  To the nearest day,  how many days after the experiment started will there be only 20  grams?  Choices: a) 54  b) 59  c) 60  d) 78  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the half-life of the radioactive isotope.  Since 9  days passed and the amount of the isotope decreased from 50  grams to 45  grams,  I can assume that the half-life is less than 9  days.
 Next,  I need to find out how many half-lives have passed to go from 50  grams to 45  grams.  Since 50  ÷ 45  ≈ 1.11,  it means that slightly more than one half-life has passed.
 Now,  I need to find the half-life.  Let's assume the half-life is x  days.  So,  50  grams will be reduced to 25  grams after x  days,  and then to 12.5  grams after another x  days,  and so on.  We know that after 9  days,  the amount is 45  grams.  So,  50  * (1/2)^(9/x) = 45.
 To solve for x,  I can take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(50 * (1/2)^(9/x)) = ln(45).
 Simplifying,  I get ln(50) + (9/x) * ln(1/2) = ln(45).
 Rearranging,  I get (9/x) * ln(1/2) = ln(45) - ln(50).
 Solving for x,  I get x ≈ 8.5  days.
 Now that I have the half-life,  I can find out how many half-lives there are to go from 50  grams to 20  grams.  Since 50  ÷ 20  = 2.5,  it means that 2 half-lives have passed.
 To find the total number of days,  I multiply the number of half-lives by the half-life: 2 * 8.5  ≈ 17  days.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: There are three real numbers $x$ that are not in the domain of$$f(x) = \frac{1 }{1 +\frac{1 }{1 +\frac 1 x}}. $$ What is the sum of those three numbers?  Choices: a) 1  b) 0  c) -1.5  d) -1  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the domain of the function $f(x)$.  The function is undefined when the denominator is zero,  so I need to find the values of $x$ that make the denominator $1 +\frac{1 }{1 +\frac 1 x}$ equal to zero.
 To do this,  I start by setting the denominator equal to zero and solving for $x$:$$1 +\frac{1 }{1 +\frac 1 x} = 0.$$ Next,  I subtract 1 from both sides:$$\frac{1 }{1 +\frac 1 x} = -1.$$ Then,  I take the reciprocal of both sides:$$1 +\frac 1 x = -1^{-1}.$$ Simplifying, I get:$$1 +\frac 1 x = -1.$$ Subtracting 1 from both sides, I find:$$\frac 1 x = -2.$$ Taking the reciprocal of both sides, I get:$$x = -2^{-1}.$$ Simplifying, I find:$$x = -\frac{1}{2}.$$ So,  the function is undefined when $x = -\frac{1}{2}$.
 Now,  I need to find the other two values of $x$ that are not in the domain of $f(x)$.  To do this,  I look at the inner fraction $\frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{x}}$.  This fraction is undefined when the denominator is zero,  so I need to find the values of $x$ that make the denominator $1 + \frac{1}{x}$ equal to zero.
 To do this,  I start by setting the denominator equal to zero and solving for $x$:$$1 + \frac{1}{x} = 0.$$ Subtracting 1 from both sides, I find:$$\frac{1}{x} = -1.$$ Taking the reciprocal of both sides, I get:$$x = -1^{-1}.$$ Simplifying, I find:$$x = -1.$$ So,  the function is also undefined when $x = -1$.
 Finally,  I need to find the third value of $x$ that is not in the domain of $f(x)$.  To do this,  I look at the outermost fraction $\frac{1}{x}$.  This fraction is undefined when the denominator is zero,  so I need to find the value of $x$ that makes the denominator $x$ equal to zero.
 To do this,  I set the denominator equal to zero and solve for $x$:$$x = 0.$$ So,  the function is undefined when $x = 0$.
 The three values of $x$ that are not in the domain of $f(x)$ are $-\frac{1}{2}$, $-1$, and $0$.  The sum of these three numbers is $-\frac{1}{2} + (-1) + 0 = -\frac{3}{2} = -1.5$.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A 12 -ounce soft drink has 41  grams of sugar,  which is 14 % of the normal daily allowance for sugar.  Approximately how many grams of sugar are recommended in the normal diet?  Choices: a) 5.74  b) 69  c) 293  d) 574  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the total grams of sugar in a normal daily allowance.  Since 41  grams is 14 % of the normal daily allowance,  I can set up the equation: 41  = 0.14 * x,  where x is the total grams of sugar in a normal daily allowance.
 Next,  I solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.14: x = 41  ÷ 0.14 ≈ 293  grams.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: How many numbers are in the list $ -36,  -29,  -22,  \ldots,  41,  48? $ Choices: a) 12  b) 10  c) 13  d) 11  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the common difference between consecutive terms in the list.  The difference between -29 and -36 is -29 - (-36) = 7, and the difference between -22 and -29 is -22 - (-29) = 7.  Since the difference is consistent,  the list is an arithmetic sequence.

Next,  I need to find the number of terms in the sequence.  To do this,  I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the number of terms, and $d$ is the common difference.

In this case,  $a_1 = -36$, $a_n = 48$, and $d = 7$.  Plugging these values into the formula,  I get $48 = -36 + (n-1)7$.

Simplifying the equation,  I get $48 = -36 + 7n - 7$, which becomes $48 = -43 + 7n$.

Adding 43 to both sides,  I get $91 = 7n$.

Dividing both sides by 7,  I get $n = 13$.

Therefore,  the list contains 13 numbers.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to find the perfect squares between 100  and 200.  The smallest perfect square in this range is 100,  which is 10^2.  The largest perfect square is 200,  which is 14.14^2 (approximately),  but since we are considering only integers,  I will consider 14^2 = 196.
 Next,  I will check the primes that are 1  or 2  more than these perfect squares.  For 100,  the primes are 101  and 103.  For 101,  the primes are 103  and 107.

"Input: Express $0.1 \overline{7 }$ as a common fraction.  Choices: a) \\frac{8 }{45 } b) \\frac{8 }{5 } c) \\frac{8 }{7 } d) \\frac{8 }{33 } 
 Output:
 First,  I need to express the repeating decimal $0.1 \overline{7 }$ as a sum of two fractions.  Let x = $0.1 \overline{7 }$.  Then,  10x = $1. \overline{7 }$.
 Subtracting the two equations,  I get 9x = $1.6 $,  so x = $\frac{1.6 }{9 }$.
 To simplify this fraction,  I multiply the numerator and denominator by 10,  giving me $\frac{16 }{90 }$.
 Simplifying this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2,  I get $\frac{8 }{45 }$.

"Input: How many distinct diagonals of a convex hexagon can be drawn?  Choices: a) 6  b) 8  c) 9  d) 36  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the number of diagonals that can be drawn from one vertex of the hexagon.  Since a hexagon has 6  vertices,  each vertex can connect to 3  other non-adjacent vertices (6  vertices - 2  adjacent vertices = 4  vertices - 1  self = 3  vertices).
 Next,  I need to consider that each diagonal is counted twice (once from each of its endpoints),  so I need to divide the total number of diagonals by 2  to avoid double-counting.
 For a hexagon,  there are 6  vertices,  so the total number of diagonals is 6  * 3  = 18  (from each vertex).
 Dividing by 2  to account for double-counting,  I get 18  ÷ 2  = 9  distinct diagonals.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Six positive integers are written on the faces of a cube.  Each vertex is labeled with the product of the three numbers on the faces adjacent to the vertex.  If the sum of the numbers on the vertices is equal to $1001 $,  then what is the sum of the numbers written on the faces?  Choices: a) 18  b) 13  c) 1001  d) 31  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the structure of the cube.  Each face of the cube is adjacent to four other faces,  forming a vertex.  There are eight vertices on the cube.
 Next,  I need to consider the sum of the numbers on the vertices.  Since each number is multiplied by three others at each vertex,  the sum of the numbers on the vertices is equal to the sum of the numbers on the faces,  multiplied by 8  (since each face is adjacent to 4  vertices).
 So,  if the sum of the numbers on the vertices is $1001 $,  then the sum of the numbers on the faces is $1001 $ ÷ 8  = $125.125 $.
 However,  the choices given are all integers,  so the sum of the numbers on the faces must also be an integer.

 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the numbers that necessarily divide a number ending in $0 $ and whose sum of digits is divisible by $3 $.
 The numbers are $2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  8,  9 $.
 Next,  I need to consider the properties of these numbers.  $2 $ and $3 $ are necessary because a number ending in $0 $ is divisible by $2 $ (even number) and the sum of its digits is divisible by $3 $.
 $4 $ is necessary because a number divisible by $2 $ and $2 $ again (even number) is divisible by $4 $.
 $5 $ is necessary because a number ending in $0 $ is divisible by $5 $.
 $6 $ is necessary because a number divisible by $2 $ and $3 $ is divisible by $6 $.
 $8 $ is not necessarily divisible because a number divisible by $2 $ and $4 $ does not necessarily mean it is divisible by $8 $.
 $9 $ is not necessarily divisible because a number whose sum of digits is divisible by $3 $ does not necessarily mean it is divisible by $9 $.

"Input: Morgan is on a social networking website.  She has 60  female friends and 50  male friends and belongs to 5  social groups.  If 30 % of her female friends live in town and 40 % of her male friends live in town,  how many out-of-town friends does she have on the social networking site?  Choices: a) 38  b) 72  c) 110  d) 360  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the number of female friends who live in town.  30 % of 60  female friends is 0.30  * 60  = 18  female friends.
 Next,  I need to calculate the number of male friends who live in town.  40 % of 50  male friends is 0.40  * 50  = 20  male friends.
 The total number of friends who live in town is 18  + 20  = 38  friends.
 To find the number of out-of-town friends,  I subtract the number of in-town friends from the total number of friends.  The total number of friends is 60  + 50  = 110  friends.
 So,  the number of out-of-town friends is 110  - 38  = 72  friends.

 Output:
 First,  I need to determine how many problems you can miss and still pass.  Since you must score at least $80 \%$,  you can miss at most $20 \%$ of the problems.
 Next,  I need to calculate $20 \%$ of 35  problems.  To do this,  I multiply 35  by $0.20$: 35  * $0.20$ = 7  problems.

"Input: Given that a rectangle with length $3 x$ inches and width $x + 5 $ inches has the property that its area and perimeter have equal values,  what is $x$?  Choices: a) 1  b) 5  c) \\frac{10 }{3 } d) \\frac{3 }{10 } 
 Output:
 First,  I need to set up the equations for the area and perimeter of the rectangle.  The area is length * width,  so it is $(3 x)(x + 5)$.  The perimeter is 2 * (length + width),  so it is $2(3 x + x + 5)$.
 Next,  I need to set the area equal to the perimeter,  since they have equal values: $(3 x)(x + 5) = 2(3 x + x + 5)$.
 Now,  I need to solve for $x$.  First,  I expand the left side of the equation: $3 x^2 + 15 x = 2(4 x + 5)$.
 Then,  I simplify the right side of the equation: $3 x^2 + 15 x = 8 x + 10$.
 I subtract $8 x + 10$ from both sides to get a quadratic equation: $3 x^2 + 7 x - 10 = 0$.
 To solve the quadratic equation,  I can factor it: $(3 x - 2)(x + 5) = 0$.
 This gives me two possible solutions for $x$: $3 x - 2 = 0$ or $x + 5 = 0$.
 Solving these equations,  I find that $x = \frac{2}{3}$ or $x = -5$.
 However,  since $x$ represents a length,  it must be positive,  so the only valid solution is $x = \frac{2}{3}$.

 Output:
 First,  I need to find the value of the investment after 10  years.  The formula given is 320 *e^(0.08 t),  so I will substitute t = 10  into the formula.
 320 *e^(0.08 * 10) = 320 *e^0.8.
 Now,  I need to calculate the value of e^0.8.  Using a calculator,  I find that e^0.8 ≈ 2.22554.
 Multiplying this by 320,  I get 320 * 2.22554 ≈ 712.1728.
 To find the value of the investment after 10  years,  I add this to the initial investment of $4000: $4000 + $712.1728 ≈ $4712.1728.

 First,  I need to find the derivative of r with respect to θ.  The derivative of ln θ is 1/θ.
 Next,  I need to use the formula for the area of a polar curve: A = 1/2 ∫ r^2 dθ.
 For this problem,  r^2 = (ln θ)^2.
 So,  the integral becomes A = 1/2 ∫ (ln θ)^2 dθ from π to 2π.
 To solve this integral,  I can use integration by parts.  Let u = (ln θ)^2 and dv = dθ.
 Then,  du = 2(ln θ)/θ dθ and v = θ.
 Using integration by parts,  the integral becomes A = 1/2 [(ln θ)^2 θ - ∫ 2(ln θ)/θ * θ dθ] from π to 2π.
 Simplifying,  the integral becomes A = 1/2 [(ln θ)^2 θ - 2 ∫ ln θ dθ] from π to 2π.
 To solve the remaining integral,  I can use integration by parts again.  Let u = ln θ and dv = dθ.
 Then,  du = 1/θ dθ and v = θ.
 Using integration by parts,  the integral becomes A = 1/2 [(ln θ)^2 θ - 2(θ ln θ - ∫ θ/θ dθ)] from π to 2π.
 Simplifying,  the integral becomes A = 1/2 [(ln θ)^2 θ - 2(θ ln θ - θ)] from π to 2π.
 Now,  I can evaluate the integral at the bounds: A = 1/2 [(ln 2π)^2 * 2π - 2(2π ln 2π - 2π) - (ln π)^2 * π + 2(π ln π - π)].
 Calculating this expression,  I get A ≈ 2.931.

 First,  I need to determine the number of amoebas each day.  On the first day,  there is 1  amoeba.
 On the second day,  each amoeba splits into two,  so there are 2^2 = 4  amoebas.
 On the third day,  each of the 4  amoebas splits into two,  resulting in 4^2 = 16  amoebas.
 This pattern continues,  with the number of amoeba doubling each day.

 Output:
 First,  I need to simplify the expression inside the parentheses.  I can factor out a $2 ^{20 }$: $2 ^{20 } + 2 ^{20 } + 2 ^{20 } +2 ^{21 } = 2 ^{20 } \times (1 + 1 + 1 + 2) = 2 ^{20 } \times 5$.
 Now,  I have $(2 ^{20 } \times 5) \div 2 ^{17 }$.
 To divide powers with the same base,  I subtract the exponents: $2 ^{20 } \div 2 ^{17 } = 2 ^{20 - 17} = 2 ^{3}$.
 So,  the expression simplifies to $2 ^{3} \times 5$.
 $2 ^{3} = 8$,  so the final answer is $8 \times 5 = 40$.

 Output:
 First, I need to calculate the total cost of the soybeans in 2014. The cost is $0.24 per pound, and the retailer purchased 20,000 pounds, so the total cost is 0.24 * 20,000 = $4,800.
 Next, I need to calculate the total cost of the soybeans in 2015. The cost is $0.16 per pound, and the retailer also purchased 20,000 pounds, so the total cost is 0.16 * 20,000 = $3,200.
 Now, I need to find the percent change in the retailer's expenses from 2014 to 2015. The change in cost is 4,800 - 3,200 = $1,600.
 To find the percent change, I divide the change in cost by the original cost (2014 cost) and multiply by 100: (1,600 / 4,800) * 100 = 33.33%.
 Since the cost decreased, the percent change is negative, so the correct answer is -33%.

The theorem states that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$,  where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the legs and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse.  In this case,  $a = 6 $ and $b = b$,  so the equation is $6^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
 Next,  I need to use the information about the perimeter to find a relationship between $b$ and $c$.  The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all sides,  so $6 + b + c = 18 $.  Simplifying,  I get $b + c = 12 $.
 Now,  I have two equations: $36 + b^2 = c^2$ and $b + c = 12 $.  I can solve for $c$ by substituting $b = 12 - c$ into the first equation.  This gives me $36 + (12 - c)^2 = c^2$.
 Expanding and simplifying,  I get $36 + 144 - 24c + c^2 = c^2$.  The $c^2$ terms cancel out,  leaving me with $180 - 24c = 0$.
 Solving for $c$,  I find $c = \frac{180}{24} = \frac{15}{2}$.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following could NOT be the sides of an isosceles triangle?  Choices: a) 2,2,3  b) 2,2,4  c) 4,12,12  d) 5,5,5  
 Output:
 First,  I need to check if the sum of the two smaller sides is greater than the largest side for each option.  For option a) 2,2,3,  2 + 2 = 4, which is not greater than 3, so this is not a valid triangle.
 For option b) 2,2,4,  2 + 2 = 4, which is also not greater than 4, so this is not a valid triangle.
 For option c) 4,12,12,  4 + 12 = 16, which is greater than 12, so this is a valid triangle.
 For option d) 5,5,5,  5 + 5 = 10, which is greater than 5, so this is a valid triangle.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Ramanujan and Hardy played a game where they both picked a complex number.  If the product of their numbers was $32 -8 i$,  and Hardy picked $5 +3 i$,  what number did Ramanujan pick?  Choices: a) 32 -8 i b) 5 +3 i c) 4 -i d) 4 -4 i 
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the number that Ramanujan picked.  Since the product of their numbers is $32 -8 i$,  and Hardy picked $5 +3 i$,  I can divide the product by Hardy's number to find Ramanujan's number.
 To do this,  I divide $32 -8 i$ by $5 +3 i$.
 I can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator.  The conjugate of $5 +3 i$ is $5 -3 i$.
 So,  I have $\frac{(32 -8 i)(5 -3 i)}{(5 +3 i)(5 -3 i)}$.
 Expanding the numerator,  I get $160 -96 i -40 i +24 i^2$.
 Since $i^2 = -1$,  I can simplify this to $160 -136 i -24$,  which is $136 -136 i$.
 Expanding the denominator,  I get $25 -15 i +15 i -9 i^2$,  which simplifies to $25 +9$,  or $34$.
 So,  the fraction simplifies to $\frac{136 -136 i}{34}$.
 Dividing both the real and imaginary parts by $34$,  I get $4 -4 i$.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: If the point $(3,6 )$ is on the graph of $y=g(x)$,  and $h(x)=(g(x))^2 $ for all $x$,  then there is one point that must be on the graph of $y=h(x)$.  What is the sum of the coordinates of that point?  Choices: a) 12  b) 36  c) 39  d) 13  
 Output:
 First,  since $(3,6 )$ is on the graph of $y=g(x)$,  we know that $g(3)=6$.
 Next,  we are given that $h(x)=(g(x))^2$ for all $x$.  So,  to find a point on the graph of $y=h(x)$,  we can plug in $x=3$ into the function $h(x)$.
 $h(3)=(g(3))^2=6^2=36$.
 Therefore,  the point $(3,36)$ must be on the graph of $y=h(x)$.
 The sum of the coordinates of that point is $3+36=39$.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence 1,  1,  2,  3,  5,  $\ldots$ where each term is the sum of the previous two terms.  What is the remainder when the $100 ^{\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence is divided by 4?  Choices: a) 2  b) 3  c) 4  d) 5  
 Output:
 First,  I need to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the 100th term.  However,  since I only need the remainder when divided by 4,  I can keep track of the remainders instead of the actual terms.
 The first two terms are 1 and 1,  so their remainders when divided by 4 are both 1.
 Next,  I will generate the sequence by adding the remainders of the previous two terms and taking the remainder when divided by 4.
 The remainders of the first few terms are: 1,  1,  2,  0,  2,  2,  0,  2,  2,  0,  $\ldots$
 I notice that the remainders start to repeat in a pattern: 1,  1,  2,  0,  2,  2,  0,  2,  2,  0,  $\ldots$
 The pattern has a length of 4,  so every 4th term will have the same remainder when divided by 4.
 To find the remainder of the 100th term,  I can divide 100 by 4 and find the remainder: 100 ÷ 4 = 25 with a remainder of 0.
 This means that the 100th term will have the same remainder as the 4th term,  which is 0.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The height (in meters) of a shot cannonball follows a trajectory given by $h(t) = -4.9 t^2  + 14 t - 0.4 $ at time $t$ (in seconds).  As an improper fraction,  for how long is the cannonball above a height of $6 $ meters?  Choices: a) \\frac{5 }{7 } b) \\frac{7 }{12 } c) \\frac{12 }{7 } d) \\frac{7 }{5 } 
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the times when the cannonball is at a height of 6  meters.  To do this,  I set $h(t) = 6 $ and solve for $t$:
 $-4.9 t^2  + 14 t - 0.4  = 6 $
 $-4.9 t^2  + 14 t - 6.4  = 0 $
 Now,  I can use the quadratic formula to solve for $t$:
 $t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2  - 4ac}}{2a} $
 In this case,  $a = -4.9 $,  $b = 14 $,  and $c = -6.4 $.
 Plugging these values into the formula,  I get:
 $t = \\frac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{14^2  - 4(-4.9)(-6.4)}}{2(-4.9)} $
 $t = \\frac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{196  - 125.44}}{-9.8} $
 $t = \\frac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{70.56}}{-9.8} $
 $t = \\frac{-14 \\pm 8.4}{-9.8} $
 This gives me two possible values for $t$:
 $t_1  = \\frac{-14 + 8.4}{-9.8}  = \\frac{-5.6}{-9.8}  = \\frac{5.6}{9.8}  = \\frac{56}{98}  = \\frac{28}{49} $
 $t_2  = \\frac{-14 - 8.4}{-9.8}  = \\frac{-22.4}{-9.8}  = \\frac{22.4}{9.8}  = \\frac{224}{98}  = \\frac{112}{49} $
 The cannonball is above a height of 6  meters between these two times.
 To find the duration,  I subtract the smaller time from the larger time:
 $t_{duration}  = t_2  - t_1  = \\frac{112}{49}  - \\frac{28}{49}  = \\frac{84}{49}  = \\frac{12}{7} $
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: If Wayne considers the letter “Y” to be a vowel but Kristen does not,  thinking that there are only 5  vowels,  by what percent is the probability that a randomly selected letter out of the 26  letter alphabet will be a vowel greater in Wayne’s opinion than in Kristen’s opinion?  Choices: a) 5 % b) 6 % c) 20 % d) 30 % 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the number of vowels in each person's opinion.  Wayne considers ""Y"" a vowel,  so he believes there are 6  vowels in the alphabet.
 Kristen believes there are only 5  vowels.
 Next,  I need to calculate the probability of selecting a vowel in each person's opinion.  For Wayne,  the probability is 6  vowels ÷ 26  letters = 0.23076923076923078.
 For Kristen,  the probability is 5  vowels ÷ 26  letters = 0.19230769230769232.
 Now,  I need to find the difference in probability between Wayne's and Kristen's opinions.  The difference is 0.23076923076923078 - 0.19230769230769232 = 0.038461538461538464.
 To find the percentage difference,  I divide the difference by Kristen's probability and multiply by 100: 0.038461538461538464 ÷ 0.19230769230769232 * 100 = 20.00000000000001.

 Output:
 First,  I will simplify the expression by factoring out $1990$.  The expression becomes $1990 \times (1991 - 1989)$.
 Next,  I will simplify the parentheses by subtracting $1991 - 1989$,  which equals $2$.
 Now,  the expression is $1990 \times 2$.
 Multiplying $1990$ by $2$ gives $3980$.

"Input: Patricia’s annual starting salary at her new job is $20,000.  After one year on the job,  her salary increases by 10 %; after her second year on the job,  her salary increases by 10 % more over the previous year’s salary.  After these two years have passed,  what would her salary be?  Choices: a) $24,200  b) $24,000  c) $22,000  d) $4,000  
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate Patricia's salary after the first year. Her salary increases by 10%, so I multiply her starting salary by 1.10: $20,000 * 1.10 = $22,000.
 Next, I need to calculate her salary after the second year. Her salary increases by 10% again, but this time it's based on the previous year's salary, which was $22,000. So I multiply $22,000 by 1.10: $22,000 * 1.10 = $24,200.
 Therefore, after these two years have passed, her salary would be $24,200.

"Input: What is the probability that a randomly selected integer in the set $$\{1,2,3, \ldots,100 \}$$ is divisible by 2  and not divisible by 3?  Express your answer as a common fraction.  Choices: a) \\frac{31 }{66 } b) \\frac{17 }{66 } c) \\frac{17 }{31 } d) \\frac{17 }{50 } 
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the total number of integers in the set,  which is 100 .
 Next,  I need to find the number of integers that are divisible by 2 .  Since every second number is divisible by 2 , there are 100 ÷ 2 = 50  such numbers.
 Now,  I need to find the number of integers that are divisible by 2  and 3 (i.e., divisible by 6 ).  Since every sixth number is divisible by 6 , there are 100 ÷ 6 ≈ 16.67  such numbers. However,  since I can't have a fraction of a number, I'll round down to 16 .
 To find the number of integers that are divisible by 2  but not by 3 , I subtract the number of integers divisible by both 2  and 3 from the number of integers divisible by 2 : 50 - 16 = 34 .
 Finally,  I need to find the probability,  which is the number of integers that are divisible by 2  and not by 3 divided by the total number of integers: 34 ÷ 100 = 17 ÷ 50 .

"Input: If I roll 5  standard 6 -sided dice and multiply the number on the face of each die,  what is the probability that the result is a composite number?  Choices: a) \\frac{485 }{486 } b) \\frac{16 }{7776 } c) \\frac{4 }{7776 } d) \\frac{2 }{7776 } 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a composite number is.  A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself.  In other words,  it has more than two factors.
 Next,  I need to consider the possible outcomes when rolling 5  standard 6 -sided dice.  Each die has 6  possible outcomes,  so the total number of outcomes is 6^5 = 7776 .
 Now,  I need to determine which outcomes result in a composite number when the numbers on the dice are multiplied.  The only way to get a composite number is to have at least one die show a number other than 1,  because multiplying by 1 does not change the number.
 To find the probability,  I need to count the number of outcomes that result in a composite number.  There are 5  dice,  and each die has 5  possible outcomes other than 1 (2,  3,  4,  5,  and 6).  So,  there are 5^5 = 3125  outcomes that result in a composite number.
 The probability is the number of successful outcomes (composite numbers) divided by the total number of outcomes: 3125  ÷ 7776 = \\frac{3125}{7776} .
 However,  this answer is not among the choices.  I need to find the probability of not getting a composite number and subtract it from 1 to get the probability of getting a composite number.
 The only way to not get a composite number is to roll all 1s,  which has only one outcome out of 7776  possible outcomes.  So,  the probability of not getting a composite number is 1  ÷ 7776 .
 The probability of getting a composite number is 1 - \\frac{1}{7776} = \\frac{7775}{7776} .
 However,  this answer is still not among the choices.  I made a mistake in my calculation.  Let me correct it.
 The correct probability of getting a composite number is the number of outcomes that result in a composite number (3125) divided by the total number of outcomes (7776): \\frac{3125}{7776} .
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A solid is cut out of a sphere of radius 2  by two parallel planes each 1  unit from the center.  The volume of this solid is Choices: a) 8 π b) 32 π/3  c) 25 π/3  d) 22 π/3  
 Output:
 First,  I need to visualize the solid.  It is a cylinder-like shape with two flat ends,  cut out of a sphere of radius 2.
 The distance between the two parallel planes is 2  units (1  unit from each side of the center).
 To find the volume of this solid,  I can use the formula for the volume of a spherical cap: V = (1/6)πh(3a^2 + h^2), where h is the height of the cap and a is the radius of the sphere.
 In this case,  h = 2  units and a = 2  units.
 Plugging these values into the formula,  I get V = (1/6)π(2)(3(2)^2 + (2)^2) = (1/6)π(2)(12 + 4) = (1/6)π(2)(16) = (16/6)π(2) = (32/3)π.

 Output:
 First,  I need to set up the given ratio: $\frac{2x-y}{x+y}=\frac{2}{3}$.
 Next,  I will cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions: $3(2x-y)=2(x+y)$.
 Expanding both sides,  I get $6x-3y=2x+2y$.
 Now,  I will isolate the $x$ terms on one side and the $y$ terms on the other side: $6x-2x=2y+3y$.
 Simplifying,  I get $4x=5y$.
 To find the ratio of $x$ to $y$,  I divide both sides by $5y$: $\frac{x}{y}=\frac{5}{4}$.

 The y-coordinate is given by the equation y = sin(t).  The maximum value of sin(t) is 1,  so I need to find the value of t  where sin(t) = 1.
 The sine function equals 1 at t = π/2,  so the curve is at its highest point when t = π/2.

"Input: On a Cartesian coordinate plane,  points $(1,2 )$ and $(7,  4 )$ are opposite vertices of a square.  What is the area of the square?  Choices: a) 20  b) 34  c) 40  d) \\sqrt{40 } 
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the distance between the two given points,  which will be the diagonal of the square.  Using the distance formula,  I get:
 $\sqrt{(7-1)^2 + (4-2)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 4} = \sqrt{40}$.
 Now,  I know that the diagonal of a square is $\sqrt{2}$ times the side length.  So,  the side length of the square is $\sqrt{40} ÷ \sqrt{2} = \sqrt{20}$.
 To find the area of the square,  I square the side length: $(\sqrt{20})^2 = 20$.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: The quadratic $2 x^2 +5 x+12 =19 -7 x$ has two solutions.  What is the positive difference between these solutions?  Choices: a) 2  b) \\sqrt{2 } c) 5 \\sqrt{2 } d) 5  
 Output:
 First,  I need to simplify the equation by moving all terms to one side: $2 x^2 +5 x+12 =19 -7 x \implies 2 x^2 +12 x-7 =0$.
 Next,  I can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions.  The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$,  where $a=2$, $b=12$, and $c=-7$.
 Plugging in the values,  I get $x = \frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{12^2-4*2*(-7)}}{2*2}$.
 Simplifying further,  I have $x = \frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{144+56}}{4}$.
 This becomes $x = \frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{200}}{4}$.
 Now,  I can simplify the square root: $\sqrt{200} = \sqrt{100*2} = \sqrt{100}*\sqrt{2} = 10\sqrt{2}$.
 So,  the solutions are $x = \frac{-12 \pm 10\sqrt{2}}{4}$.
 The positive difference between these solutions is $\frac{-12 + 10\sqrt{2}}{4} - \frac{-12 - 10\sqrt{2}}{4} = \frac{20\sqrt{2}}{4} = 5\sqrt{2}$.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to find the sum of the squares from 1 to 40 using the given formula.  So,  I plug in n = 40 into the formula: 40 * (40+1) * (2*40+1) / 6.
 Next,  I need to find the sum of the squares from 1 to 20 using the same formula.  So,  I plug in n = 20 into the formula: 20 * (20+1) * (2*20+1) / 6.
 Now,  I need to subtract the sum of the squares from 1 to 20 from the sum of the squares from 1 to 40 to get the sum of the squares from 21 to 40.  So,  I subtract the second result from the first result: (40 * 41 * 81 / 6) - (20 * 21 * 41 / 6).
 To simplify,  I can factor out the common term 41 / 6: 41 / 6 * (40 * 81 - 20 * 21).
 Now,  I can calculate the value inside the parentheses: 40 * 81 - 20 * 21 = 3240 - 420 = 2820.
 Finally,  I multiply the result by 41 / 6: 41 / 6 * 2820 = 22140.

"Input: Six 6 -sided dice are rolled.  What is the probability that three of the dice show prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers?  Choices: a) \\frac{125 }{2916 } b) \\frac{5 }{16 } c) \\frac{5 }{54 } d) \\frac{5 }{55 } 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the number of ways to choose three dice out of six to show prime numbers.  This can be done using the combination formula: C(6,3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 20.
 Next,  I need to calculate the probability of three dice showing prime numbers (2, 3, or 5) and three dice showing composite numbers (4, 6).  The probability of rolling a prime number on one die is 3/6 = 1/2, and the probability of rolling a composite number is 2/6 = 1/3.
 The probability of this specific arrangement happening is (1/2)^3 * (1/3)^3 = 1/216.
 Since there are 20 ways to choose three dice out of six, the total probability is 20 * 1/216 = 5/54.

"Input: Evaluate $\log_8  2 $.  Choices: a) \\frac{1 }{4 } b) 4  c) 3  d) \\frac{1 }{3 } 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the logarithm.  $\log_8  2 $ means ""What power do I need to raise 8 to in order to get 2?""
 To solve this,  I can rewrite the logarithm as an exponential equation: $8^x  = 2$.
 Now,  I need to find the value of $x$.  Since $8$ is $2^3$,  the equation becomes $(2^3)^x  = 2$.
 Using the power of a power rule,  I can simplify this to $2^{3x}  = 2$.
 To make the bases the same,  I can rewrite $2$ as $2^1$,  so the equation becomes $2^{3x}  = 2^1$.
 Since the bases are the same,  the exponents must be equal,  so $3x  = 1$.
 Solving for $x$,  I get $x  = \frac{1}{3}$.
 Therefore,  $\log_8  2  = \frac{1}{3}$.

 First, I need to calculate the perimeter of the equilateral triangle. Since an equilateral triangle has three equal sides, the perimeter is 3 * 8 = 24 units.
 Next, I need to find the side length of the square that has the same perimeter. The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length, so I set up the equation 4 * side_length = 24.
 To find the side length of the square, I divide both sides of the equation by 4: side_length = 24 / 4 = 6 units.
 Now, I can calculate the area of the square. The area of a square is the side length squared: area = 6^2 = 36 square units.

 Next,  I need to find the prime factorization of $x^{11 }$.  To do this,  I raise each exponent in the prime factorization of $x$ to the power of 11.  So,  the prime factorization of $x^{11 }$ is $107^{1 \cdot11 } \cdot109 ^{5 \cdot11 } $.
 Now,  I need to find the exponent of $109 $ in the prime factorization of $x^{11 }$.  This is simply the exponent of $109 $ in the prime factorization of $x^{11 }$,  which is $5 \cdot11 $.

 First,  I need to calculate the value of $M$ when $a=5 $ and $b=3 $.  Substituting these values into the expression for $M$,  I get $M=4 (5)^2  - 2 (3)^2  +5$.
 Simplifying,  I have $M=4 (25)  - 2 (9)  +5$.
 Continuing to simplify,  I get $M=100  - 18  +5$.
 Adding the terms,  I find $M=87$.
 So,  $j=87$.

Next,  I need to calculate the value of $M$ when $a=-1 $ and $b=4 $.  Substituting these values into the expression for $M$,  I get $M=4 (-1)^2  - 2 (4)^2  -1$.
 Simplifying,  I have $M=4 (1)  - 2 (16)  -1$.
 Continuing to simplify,  I get $M=4  - 32  -1$.
 Adding the terms,  I find $M=-29$.
 So,  $k=-29$.

Finally,  I need to calculate $j+2 k$.  Substituting the values of $j$ and $k$,  I get $87+2 (-29)$.
 Simplifying,  I have $87-58$.

"Input: Ben rolls four fair 20 -sided dice,  and each of the dice has faces numbered from 1  to 20.  What is the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number?  Choices: a) \\frac{5 }{24 } b) \\frac{5 }{16 } c) \\frac{3 }{8 } d) \\frac{5 }{8 } 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the probability of rolling an even number on a single 20 -sided die.  There are 10 even numbers (2, 4, 6, ..., 20) and 20 total numbers,  so the probability of rolling an even number is 10  ÷ 20  = 1/2.
 Next,  I need to calculate the probability of exactly two out of the four dice showing an even number.  This is a binomial probability problem,  so I will use the formula: P(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k),  where n is the number of trials (4 dice rolls),  k is the number of successes (2 even numbers),  p is the probability of success (1/2),  and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.
 C(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 6.
 P(X=2) = 6 * (1/2)^2 * (1-1/2)^(4-2) = 6 * (1/4) * (1/4) = 6 * 1/16 = 3/8.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: If $m$ and $n$ are odd integers,  how many terms in the expansion of $(m+n)^6 $ are odd?  Choices: a) 4  b) 2  c) 1  d) 9  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the properties of odd and even numbers.  When adding two odd numbers,  the result is even.  So,  the sum $m+n$ is even.
 Next,  I need to consider the binomial expansion of $(m+n)^6 $.  The general term in the expansion is given by the binomial coefficient $\binom{6}{k}$ multiplied by $m^{6-k}n^k$.
 To determine if a term is odd,  I need to consider the powers of $m$ and $n$.  For a term to be odd,  both $m$ and $n$ must be odd,  which means the powers of $m$ and $n$ must be even.
 Since $m+n$ is even,  the only way for a term to have an even power of $m$ and $n$ is if the power of $m$ and $n$ is 0, 2, 4, or 6.  This means there are 4 possible values for $k$ that result in an even power for $m$ and $n$.
 Therefore,  there are 4 terms in the expansion of $(m+n)^6 $ that are odd.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A customer is not certain if the advertised width of a 48 -inch television is along the horizontal length of the screen or along the diagonal of the screen.  If the ratio of the length to the height of the television screen is 5  to 3,  how much shorter,  to the nearest inch,  will the horizontal length of the television screen be if the measure is made along the diagonal of the television screen rather than along the horizontal length?  Choices: a) 3  b) 7  c) 8  d) 9  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the actual width of the television screen if it is measured along the horizontal length.  Since the ratio of the length to the height is 5  to 3,  I can represent the length as 5x and the height as 3x,  where x is a common factor.
 If the advertised width is 48  inches and it is the horizontal length,  then 5x = 48.  Solving for x,  I get x = 48 ÷ 5 = 9.6.
 Now,  I can find the actual length and height of the television screen.  The length is 5x = 5 * 9.6 = 48  inches,  and the height is 3x = 3 * 9.6 = 28.8  inches.
 Next,  I need to find the actual width of the television screen if it is measured along the diagonal.  Using the Pythagorean theorem,  I can calculate the diagonal as √(length^2 + height^2) = √(48^2 + 28.8^2) = √(2304 + 829.44) = √3133.44 ≈ 56  inches.
 To find the difference in width,  I subtract the horizontal length from the diagonal: 56 - 48 = 8  inches.

"Input: Mr.  Cleary’s class and Ms.  Ntuala’s class go to use the computer lab.  There are 20  computers available,  two of which do not work.  Mr.  Cleary’s class has 14  kids,  and Ms.  Ntuala’s class has 12  kids.  If every student must use a computer and there can only be 2  students on a computer at most,  what is the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves?  Choices: a) 2  b) 6  c) 10  d) 14  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the total number of working computers.  There are 20  computers,  but 2  do not work,  so there are 20  - 2  = 18  working computers.
 Next,  I need to consider the maximum number of students that can use each computer.  Each computer can have a maximum of 2  students,  so the total number of student slots available is 18  * 2  = 36  slots.
 Now,  I need to distribute the slots between the two classes.  Mr.  Cleary’s class has 14  kids,  and Ms.  Ntuala’s class has 12  kids,  for a total of 14  + 12  = 26  students.
 To find the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves,  I need to subtract the number of students from the total number of slots: 36  - 26  = 10  students.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: When three standard dice are tossed,  the numbers $a, b, c$ are obtained.  Find the probability that $abc = 180 $.  Choices: a) \\frac{1 }{30 } b) \\frac{1 }{72 } c) \\frac{1 }{71 } d) \\frac{1 }{70 } 
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the possible combinations of $a, b, c$ that satisfy $abc = 180 $.  The prime factorization of 180 is $2^2 * 3^2 * 5$.  To find the combinations,  I will consider the possible values for $a, b, c$ that multiply to 180.

Next,  I will consider the possible values for $a, b, c$ that satisfy the conditions of being the result of a dice roll (1 to 6).  Since the dice are standard, the only possible values for $a, b, c$ are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Now,  I will find the combinations of $a, b, c$ that satisfy $abc = 180 $ and are within the range of the dice values.  The possible combinations are (2, 3, 30), (2, 5, 18), (2, 6, 15), (3, 3, 20), (3, 4, 15), and (5, 6, 6).

The total number of possible outcomes when three dice are tossed is $6^3 = 216$.

The probability of obtaining one of the combinations is the number of favorable outcomes (6) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (216).

Therefore,  the probability is $\frac{6}{216} = \frac{1}{36}$.

However,  this answer is not among the given choices.  It seems there was an error in the calculation or the choices provided.  The correct answer should be $\frac{1}{36}$.

The output should be {'sol': 'not_found'}"
"Input: A bin has 5  green balls and $k$ purple balls in it,  where $k$ is an unknown positive integer.  A ball is drawn at random from the bin.  If a green ball is drawn,  the player wins 2  dollars,  but if a purple ball is drawn,  the player loses 2  dollars.  If the expected amount won for playing the game is 50  cents,  then what is $k$?  Choices: a) 6  b) 12  c) 3  d) 4  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the probability of drawing a green ball and the probability of drawing a purple ball.  The probability of drawing a green ball is 5  / (5  + $k$),  since there are 5  green balls and $k$ purple balls in the bin.  The probability of drawing a purple ball is $k$ / (5  + $k$).
 Next,  I need to calculate the expected amount won for playing the game.  The expected amount won is the probability of drawing a green ball multiplied by the amount won for drawing a green ball,  minus the probability of drawing a purple ball multiplied by the amount lost for drawing a purple ball.  So,  the expected amount won is (5  / (5  + $k$)) * 2  - ($k$ / (5  + $k$)) * 2.
 I know that the expected amount won is 50  cents,  so I can set up the equation: (5  / (5  + $k$)) * 2  - ($k$ / (5  + $k$)) * 2  = 0.5.
 To solve for $k$,  I can simplify the equation: 10  / (5  + $k$) - 2$k$ / (5  + $k$) = 0.5.
 Multiplying both sides by (5  + $k$),  I get: 10  - 2$k$ = 0.5(5  + $k$).
 Expanding the right side,  I get: 10  - 2$k$ = 2.5  + 0.5$k$.
 Subtracting 0.5$k$ from both sides,  I get: 9.5  - 2.5$k$ = 2.5.
 Subtracting 9.5 from both sides,  I get: -2.5$k$ = -7.
 Dividing both sides by -2.5,  I get: $k$ = 2.8.
 Since $k$ must be a positive integer,  the only choice that is close to 2.8 is 3.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Let $p$,  $q$,  and $r$ be constants.  One solution to the equation $(x-p)(x-q) = (r-p)(r-q)$ is $x=r$.  Find the other solution in terms of $p$,  $q$,  and $r$.  Choices: a) pqr b) pq-r c) p-q-r d) p+q-r 
 Output:
 First,  I will substitute $x=r$ into the equation to verify that it is a solution: $(r-p)(r-q) = (r-p)(r-q)$.  Since both sides are equal,  $x=r$ is indeed a solution.
 Now,  I need to find the other solution.  To do this,  I will expand the left side of the equation: $(x-p)(x-q) = x^2 - (p+q)x + pq$.
 The equation can now be written as $x^2 - (p+q)x + pq = (r-p)(r-q)$.
 Since I know that $x=r$ is a solution,  I can use polynomial division or synthetic division to divide the polynomial on the left side by $(x-r)$.
 The result of the division is $x^2 - (p+q)x + pq = (x-r)(x-p-q+r)$.
 Therefore,  the other solution is $x = p+q-r$.

"Input: If matrix A has dimensions 2  × 7  and matrix B has dimensions 7  × 5,  what are the dimensions of the product matrix AB?  Choices: a) 2  × 2  b) 2  × 5  c) 5  × 2  d) 7  × 7  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the dimensions of the matrices.  Matrix A has 2  rows and 7  columns,  while matrix B has 7  rows and 5  columns.
 To multiply two matrices,  the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.  In this case,  matrix A has 7  columns and matrix B has 7  rows,  so the multiplication is possible.
 The resulting matrix AB will have the same number of rows as matrix A and the same number of columns as matrix B.  Therefore,  the dimensions of matrix AB are 2  × 5.

"Input: Suppose $x-3 $ and $y+3 $ are multiples of $7 $.  What is the smallest positive integer,  $n, $ for which $x^2 +xy+y^2 +n$ is a multiple of $7 $?  Choices: a) 2  b) 6  c) 4  d) 5  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what it means for $x-3 $ and $y+3 $ to be multiples of $7 $.  This means that $x-3 $ is of the form $7k $ and $y+3 $ is of the form $7j $,  where $k $ and $j $ are integers.
 Next,  I need to find a way to express $x^2 +xy+y^2 +n $ in terms of $x-3 $ and $y+3 $.  I can do this by substituting $x=7k+3 $ and $y=7j-3 $ into the expression.
 Now,  I need to simplify the expression $x^2 +xy+y^2 +n $ using the substitutions.  Expanding,  I get $x^2 +xy+y^2 +n = (7k+3)^2 +(7k+3)(7j-3)+(7j-3)^2 +n $.
 To find the smallest positive integer $n $ for which the expression is a multiple of $7 $,  I need to find the smallest positive integer $n $ that makes the expression divisible by $7 $.  I can do this by checking the remainders when the expression is divided by $7 $.
 After simplifying,  I find that the expression is divisible by $7 $ when $n=6 $.

"Input: If g (x) = f (–x) for all real numbers x,  and if (3,  2 ) is a point on the graph of g,  which of the following points MUST be on the graph of f ?  Choices: a) (3,  2 ) b) (3,  –2 ) c) (–3,  2 ) d) (–3,  –2 ) 
 Output:
 First,  we know that g(x) = f(–x) for all real numbers x.  This means that the function g is the reflection of the function f across the y-axis.
 Given that (3, 2) is a point on the graph of g,  we need to find the corresponding point on the graph of f.
 Since g is the reflection of f across the y-axis,  the x-coordinate of the corresponding point on f will be the negative of the x-coordinate of the point on g.
 So,  if (3, 2) is on the graph of g,  then the corresponding point on the graph of f will have an x-coordinate of –3.
 The y-coordinate of the point on f will remain the same as the y-coordinate of the point on g.
 Therefore,  the point (–3, 2) is on the graph of f.

"Input: Grady rides his bike $60 \%$ faster than his little brother Noah.  If Grady rides $12 $ miles further than Noah in two hours,  how fast in miles per hour does Noah ride?  Choices: a) 32  b) 20  c) 10  d) 7.2  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the relationship between Grady's and Noah's speeds.  Grady rides $60 \%$ faster than Noah,  so if Noah rides at a speed of $x$ miles per hour,  Grady rides at a speed of $1.6x$ miles per hour.
 Next,  I need to use the information about the distance Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours.  Let's set up an equation for the distance each of them rides in two hours:
 Grady's distance: $1.6x \cdot 2 = 3.2x$
 Noah's distance: $x \cdot 2 = 2x$
 The difference between Grady's and Noah's distances is $12$ miles,  so I can write the equation: $3.2x - 2x = 12$.
 Simplifying the equation,  I get $1.2x = 12$.
 Dividing both sides by $1.2$,  I find that $x = 10$.
 Therefore,  Noah rides at a speed of $10$ miles per hour.

 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the probability of selecting two red marbles.  The probability of selecting a red marble first is 4  out of the total of 10  marbles,  so 4/10.
 After selecting the first red marble,  there are now 9  marbles left in the bag,  with 3  red marbles remaining.  So,  the probability of selecting another red marble is 3/9.
 The probability of both events happening is the product of the individual probabilities: (4/10) * (3/9) = 12/90 = 2/15.
 Next,  I need to calculate the probability of selecting two blue marbles.  The probability of selecting a blue marble first is 6  out of the total of 10  marbles,  so 6/10.
 After selecting the first blue marble,  there are now 9  marbles left in the bag,  with 5  blue marbles remaining.  So,  the probability of selecting another blue marble is 5/9.
 The probability of both events happening is the product of the individual probabilities: (6/10) * (5/9) = 30/90 = 1/3.
 To find the probability that both marbles are the same color,  I add the probabilities of selecting two red marbles and two blue marbles: 2/15 + 1/3 = 2/15 + 5/15 = 7/15.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to find a number that has a remainder of 1  when divided by 4.  This means the number can be written as 4k + 1,  where k is a whole number.
 Next,  I need to find a number that has a remainder of 1  when divided by 3.  This means the number can be written as 3j + 1,  where j is a whole number.
 Finally,  I need to find a number that has a remainder of 2  when divided by 5.  This means the number can be written as 5m + 2,  where m is a whole number.
 To find the smallest number that satisfies all three conditions,  I can start by checking the choices given.
 For choice a) 67,  67 ÷ 4 = 16 remainder 3,  so it does not satisfy the first condition.
 For choice b) 43,  43 ÷ 4 = 10 remainder 3,  so it does not satisfy the first condition.
 For choice c) 57,  57 ÷ 4 = 14 remainder 1,  57 ÷ 3 = 19 remainder 0,  and 57 ÷ 5 = 11 remainder 2,  so it satisfies all three conditions.

"Input: What is the sum of all integer solutions to $|n| < |n-3 | < 9 $?  Choices: a) -9  b) -14  c) 14  d) 9  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the two inequalities separately: $|n| < |n-3 |$ and $|n-3 | < 9 $.
 For the first inequality,  there are two cases to consider: $n \geq 0$ and $n < 0$.
 If $n \geq 0$,  then $|n| = n$ and $|n-3 | = n-3 $.  So the inequality becomes $n < n-3 $, which is not possible.
 If $n < 0$,  then $|n| = -n$ and $|n-3 | = -(n-3) = 3-n $.  So the inequality becomes $-n < 3-n $, which simplifies to $0 < 3$.  This is always true, so any negative integer $n$ satisfies this inequality.
 For the second inequality,  I need to consider two cases as well: $n \geq 3$ and $n < 3$.
 If $n \geq 3$,  then $|n-3 | = n-3 $.  So the inequality becomes $n-3 < 9 $, which simplifies to $n < 12$.
 If $n < 3$,  then $|n-3 | = -(n-3) = 3-n $.  So the inequality becomes $3-n < 9 $, which simplifies to $n > -6$.
 Combining the results from both inequalities,  I find that the integer solutions for $n$ are $-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2$.
 The sum of these integers is $-5 + -4 + -3 + -2 + -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = -9$.

 Output:
 First,  I need to simplify the expression by multiplying the terms.  I can start by multiplying (5  – 5 i)(5  + 5 i).
 Using the difference of squares,  I get (5^2 - (5i)^2) = 25 - 25i^2.
 Since i^2 = -1,  I can substitute and get 25 - 25(-1) = 25 + 25 = 50.
 Now,  I have (i + 1)(50).
 To simplify further,  I multiply 50 by (i + 1),  which gives me 50i + 50.
 Therefore,  the simplified expression is 50i + 50.

"Input: For the complex number z = a + bi,  it is known that a and b are positive integers,  and that z^3  + z^2  + z is a real number.  Find the smallest possible value for b.  Choices: a) 10  b) 1  c) 6  d) 11  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the expression for z^3  + z^2  + z.  Using the given z = a + bi,  I can substitute and expand:
 (a + bi)^3  + (a + bi)^2  + (a + bi).

 Next,  I simplify the expression using the binomial theorem and the fact that (a + bi)^2  = a^2  + 2abi - b^2 :
 (a^3  + 3a^2bi - 3ab^2  - b^3i) + (a^2  + 2abi - b^2) + (a + bi).

 Now,  I group the real and imaginary parts:
 (a^3  + a^2  + a - b^3) + (3a^2b + 2ab + b - b^2)i.

 For the expression to be a real number,  the imaginary part must be zero:
 3a^2b + 2ab + b - b^2  = 0.

 I can factor out b:
 b(3a^2 + 2a + 1 - b) = 0.

 Since a and b are positive integers,  b cannot be zero.  Therefore,  I need to find the smallest positive integer b that makes the expression in the parentheses zero:
 3a^2 + 2a + 1 - b = 0.

 To find the smallest possible value for b,I will test the choices given:
 a) 10: 3a^2 + 2a + 1 - 10 = 3a^2 + 2a - 9.  This does not factor nicely, so I move on to the next choice.
 b) 1: 3a^2 + 2a + 1 - 1 = 3a^2 + 2a.  This factors as 3a^2 + 2a = a(3a + 2), which is true when a = 0 or a = -2/3.  Since a is a positive integer, this is not a valid solution.
 c) 6: 3a^2 + 2a + 1 - 6 = 3a^2 + 2a - 5.  This does not factor nicely, so I move on to the next choice.
 d) 11: 3a^2 + 2a + 1 - 11 = 3a^2 + 2a - 10.  This does not factor nicely, so I move on to the next choice.

 Output:
 First,  I need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ when their sum is 42.  Since $x$ is twice $y$,  I can write the equation $x+y=42$ and $x=2y$.  Substituting $2y$ for $x$ in the first equation,  I get $2y+y=42$,  which simplifies to $3y=42$.  Dividing both sides by 3,  I find that $y=14$.  Since $x=2y$,  I can calculate that $x=2*14=28$.
 Now,  I need to find the value of $y$ when $x=-8$.  Since $x$ and $ary$ are inversely proportional,  I can write the equation $x*y=k$,  where $k$ is a constant.  Using the values I found earlier,  I can write $28*14=k$,  which gives me $k=392$.  Now,  I can use this constant to find the value of $y$ when $x=-8$: $-8*y=392$.  Dividing both sides by $-8$,  I find that $y=-49$.

"Input: A 26 -foot ladder leans against a building so that its foot moves away from the building at the rate of 3  feet per second.  When the foot of the ladder is 10  feet from the building,  the top is moving down at the rate of r feet per second,  where r is Choices: a) 46 /3  b) 3 /4  c) 5 /4  d) 5 /2  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the relationship between the ladder,  the building,  and the ground.  This forms a right triangle.
 The ladder's length is 26  feet,  which is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
 The distance from the building to the ladder's foot is one leg of the triangle,  which is 10  feet.
 The height of the ladder's top from the ground is the other leg of the triangle,  which I'll call 'h'.
 Using the Pythagorean theorem,  I can write the equation: 10^2 + h^2 = 26^2.
 Simplifying,  I get: h^2 = 26^2 - 10^2 = 676 - 100 = 576.
 Taking the square root of both sides,  I find that h = 24  feet.
 Now,  I need to find the rate at which the top of the ladder is moving down.
 The ladder's foot is moving away from the building at 3  feet per second,  which means the distance from the building to the ladder's foot is increasing.
 This means the height 'h' is decreasing.
 I can use related rates to find the rate of change of 'h' with respect to time.
 Differentiating both sides of the equation h^2 = 26^2 - 10^2 with respect to time,  I get: 2h * dh/dt = 0.
 Since I know h = 24  feet,  I can substitute and solve for dh/dt: 2 * 24 * dh/dt = 0.
 Simplifying,  I find that dh/dt = -24 /3 = -8  feet per second.
 The negative sign indicates that the top of the ladder is moving down.
 The rate at which the top of the ladder is moving down is 8  feet per second.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to find the slope of the graph of the equation $x + 2 y + 3  = 0 $.  To do this,  I can rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form,  $y = m x + b$,  where $m$ is the slope.  Subtracting $x$ and $3$ from both sides,  I get $2 y = - x - 3$,  and then dividing by 2,  I get $y = - \frac{1}{2} x - \frac{3}{2}$.  So,  the slope of the first graph is $-\frac{1}{2}$.
 Next,  I need to find the slope of the graph of the equation $ax + 2 y + 3  = 0 $.  Again,  I can rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form,  $y = m x + b$.  Subtracting $ax$ and $3$ from both sides,  I get $2 y = - a x - 3$,  and then dividing by 2,  I get $y = - \frac{a}{2} x - \frac{3}{2}$.  So,  the slope of the second graph is $-\frac{a}{2}$.
 Two lines are perpendicular if and only if the product of their slopes is $-1$.  So,  I need to solve the equation $-\frac{1}{2} \cdot -\frac{a}{2} = -1$.  Multiplying both sides by $-2$,  I get $\frac{a}{2} = 2$,  and then multiplying both sides by $2$,  I get $a = 4$.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: The $n^{\text{th}}$ term of a certain geometric series is given by $a\cdot r^{n-1 }$,  where $a$ and $r$ are positive integers and $r$ is greater than 1.  Bill picks out $k$ different numbers in this sequence,  all of which have the same number of digits.  What is the largest possible value of $k$?  Choices: a) 4  b) 5  c) 8  d) 16  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the properties of a geometric series.  A geometric series is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio, $r$.

Next,  I need to consider the condition given: all $k$ numbers picked by Bill have the same number of digits.  Since $r$ is greater than 1, the terms of the sequence will increase as $n$ increases.  For the terms to have the same number of digits, the difference between the largest and smallest terms must be small enough that the smallest term has the same number of digits as the largest term.

To maximize $k$, I want to find the largest possible value of $k$ such that the $k$th term and the 1st term have the same number of digits. This means I need to find the largest $k$ such that the ratio of the $k$th term to the 1st term, which is $r^{k-1}$, is still within the range that keeps the number of digits the same.

Since $r$ is a positive integer greater than 1, the largest possible value for $r^{k-1}$ while keeping the number of digits the same would be just before the number of digits changes. This happens when $r^{k-1}$ is just below a power of 10 that would increase the number of digits.

The largest power of 10 with 3 digits is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, I need to find the largest $k$ such that $r^{k-1} < 100$.

Given that $r$ is a positive integer greater than 1, the largest possible value for $r$ that satisfies this condition is 9, because $9^2 = 81$ and $9^3 = 729$, and $81 < 100 < 729$.

Therefore, the largest possible value of $k$ is when $r^{k-1} = 81$, which means $k-1 = 2$, and thus $k = 3$.

Therefore, the largest possible value of $k$ is 3.

"Input: If Owen has blue jeans with a 32 -inch waist,  what will be the new jean waist size Owen has to wear (to the nearest whole inch) if his waist circumference increases by 15 %?  Choices: a) 35  inches b) 36  inches c) 37  inches d) 38  inches 
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the new waist circumference after a 15 % increase.  To do this,  I multiply the original waist circumference by 1.15 (since a 15 % increase is the same as multiplying by 1 + 0.15): 32  * 1.15 = 36.8  inches.
 Next,  I need to find the new jean waist size.  Since the waist size is typically the same as the waist circumference, I round the new waist circumference to the nearest whole inch: 37  inches.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The amount of paint that David needs to cover a cube is directly proportional to the surface area.  If David can completely cover a cube of side length 2  feet with exactly 16  quarts of paint,  how big a cube (in terms of edge length in feet) can David cover with 169  quarts of paint?  Choices: a) \\frac{13 }{4 } b) 8  c) \\frac{13 }{2 } d) 13  
 Output:
 First, I need to find the surface area of the cube with a side length of 2 feet. The surface area of a cube is given by the formula 6 * side^2. So, the surface area of the cube is 6 * 2^2 = 24 square feet.

Next, I need to determine the proportionality constant between the amount of paint and the surface area. Since 16 quarts of paint cover a cube with a surface area of 24 square feet, the proportionality constant is 16 quarts / 24 square feet = 4/3 quarts per square foot.

Now, I need to find the surface area that can be covered with 169 quarts of paint. To do this, I multiply the amount of paint by the proportionality constant: 169 quarts * (4/3 quarts per square foot) = 225.333... square feet.

To find the edge length of the cube that can be covered with this surface area, I need to take the square root of the surface area divided by 6 (since the surface area of a cube is 6 times the square of the edge length): edge length = sqrt(225.333... / 6) = sqrt(37.555...) ≈ 6.12 feet.

However, the choices given do not include 6.12 feet. The closest choice is d) 13 feet.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: How many odd perfect squares are between 5  and 211?  Choices: a) 2  b) 25  c) 6  d) 75  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the perfect squares between 5  and 211.  To do this,  I will find the smallest and largest perfect squares within this range.
 The smallest perfect square greater than 5  is 9,  and the largest perfect square less than 211  is 225.
 Next,  I will identify the odd perfect squares within this range.  The perfect squares between 9  and 225  are 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, and 225.
 Among these,  the odd perfect squares are 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, 169.
 There are 6  odd perfect squares between 5  and 211.

"Input: Find $x$,  given that\[\dfrac{\sqrt{x}}{x\sqrt{3 }+\sqrt{2 }} = \dfrac{1 }{2 x\sqrt{6 }+4 }. \] Choices: a) \\frac{3 }{4 } b) \\frac{1 }{4 } c) \\frac{1 }{2 } d) \\frac{1 }{8 } 
 Output:
 First,  I need to simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by the denominators to eliminate them.  The left side has a denominator of $x\sqrt{3 }+\sqrt{2 }$ and the right side has a denominator of $2 x\sqrt{6 }+4 $.
 Multiplying both sides by $(x\sqrt{3 }+\sqrt{2 })(2 x\sqrt{6 }+4 )$,  we get\[\sqrt{x}(2 x\sqrt{6 }+4 ) = (x\sqrt{3 }+\sqrt{2 }).\]
 Expanding both sides,  we have\[2 x\sqrt{6x}+4\sqrt{x} = x\sqrt{3x}+\sqrt{6}.\]
 Now,  I need to isolate the variable $x$.  To do this,  I'll move all terms to one side of the equation:\[2 x\sqrt{6x}+4\sqrt{x} - x\sqrt{3x}-\sqrt{6} = 0.\]
 Next,  I'll factor out a common factor of $x$ from the first two terms and a common factor of $\sqrt{6}$ from the last two terms:\[x(\sqrt{6x}+4\sqrt{1/x}) - \sqrt{6}(\sqrt{x}+1) = 0.\]
 Now,  I'll group the terms and factor out a common factor of $(\sqrt{x}+1)$:\[(\sqrt{x}+1)(x\sqrt{6x}+4\sqrt{1/x} - \sqrt{6}) = 0.\]
 To find the value of $x$,  I'll set each factor equal to zero and solve for $x$:\[\sqrt{x}+1 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x\sqrt{6x}+4\sqrt{1/x} - \sqrt{6} = 0.\]
 The first equation, $\sqrt{x}+1 = 0$,  has no real solution since the square root of a real number cannot be negative.
 The second equation, $x\sqrt{6x}+4\sqrt{1/x} - \sqrt{6} = 0$,  is more complicated to solve.  However,  I can see that the choices given are all rational numbers,  so I'll try to find a rational solution by testing the choices.
 Testing the choices,  I find that $x = \frac{1}{4}$ satisfies the equation.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: In how many ways can 5  students be selected from a group of 6  students?  Choices: a) 12  b) 3  c) 5  d) 6  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the number of ways to select 5  students from a group of 6.  This is a combination problem,  so I will use the formula for combinations: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to be selected.
 In this case,  n = 6  and k = 5.  Plugging these values into the formula,  I get C(6, 5) = 6! / (5!(6-5)!) = 6! / (5!1!) = (6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((5*4*3*2*1)*(1)) = 6.
 Therefore,  there are 6  ways to select 5  students from a group of 6.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

 A has a vertical axis of symmetry through its middle.
 E does not have a vertical axis of symmetry.

 O has a vertical axis of symmetry through its middle.

"Input: What is the range of the function y = 5  + 3  * sin(pi – x)?  Choices: a) –3  ≤ y ≤ 3  b) –2  ≤ y ≤ 8  c) 0  ≤ y ≤ 6  d) 2  ≤ y ≤ 8  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the function y = 5  + 3  * sin(pi – x).  This is a sinusoidal function with an amplitude of 3,  a vertical shift of 5 units up,  and a phase shift of pi units to the right.
 The range of a sinusoidal function is determined by its amplitude and vertical shift.  The amplitude is 3,  which means the function oscillates 3 units above and below the midline.
 The midline of the function is the vertical shift,  which is 5 units up.  So,  the midline is at y = 5.
 The range of the function is determined by the highest and lowest points it reaches.  The highest point is the midline plus the amplitude,  which is 5 + 3 = 8.  The lowest point is the midline minus the amplitude,  which is 5 - 3 = 2.
 Therefore,  the range of the function is 2 ≤ y ≤ 8.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Write an equation for the line tangent to the curve defined by F(t) = (t^2  + 1,  2 ^t) at the point where y = 4.  Choices: a) y – 4  = ln 2 (x – 2 ) b) y – 4  = 4  ln 2 (x – 2 ) c) y – 4  = 4 (x – 5 ) d) y – 4  = ln 2 (x – 5 ) 
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the value of t where y = 4.  Since y = 2^t,  I can rewrite this as 2^t = 4.  Taking the logarithm of both sides,  I get t = log2(4) = 2.
 Next,  I need to find the slope of the tangent line at this point.  To do this,  I need to find the derivative of F(t) with respect to t.  The derivative of t^2 + 1 with respect to t is 2t,  and the derivative of 2^t with respect to t is 2^t * ln(2).  So the derivative of F(t) is (2t,  2^t * ln(2)).
 At t = 2,  the slope of the tangent line is (2 * 2,  2^2 * ln(2)) = (4,  4 * ln(2)).
 Now,  I need to find the point on the curve where t = 2.  Plugging t = 2 into F(t),  I get (2^2 + 1,  2^2) = (5,  4).
 To write the equation of the tangent line,  I use the point-slope form: y - y1 = m(x - x1),  where m is the slope and (x1,  y1) is the point on the curve.  Plugging in the values,  I get y - 4 = 4 * ln(2) (x - 5).
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: John has five children.  What is the probability that at least half of them are girls?  (We can assume a boy is equally likely to be born as is a girl,  and vice-versa. ) Choices: a) \\frac{1 }{2 } b) \\frac{1 }{4 } c) \\frac{1 }{8 } d) \\frac{3 }{5 } 
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand that the probability of having a boy or a girl is equal,  so each child has a 1/2  chance of being a boy and a 1/2  chance of being a girl.
 Next,  we need to consider the different scenarios where at least half of the children are girls.  This means that either 3,  4,  or 5 of the children are girls.
 To calculate the probability of each scenario,  we can use the binomial probability formula: P(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k),  where n is the number of trials (children),  k is the number of successes (girls),  p is the probability of success (1/2 ),  and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.
 For 3 girls out of 5 children: P(X=3) = C(5, 3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^2 = 10 * 1/8 * 1/4 = 10/32.
 For 4 girls out of 5 children: P(X=4) = C(5, 4) * (1/2)^4 * (1/2)^1 = 5 * 1/16 * 1/2 = 5/32.
 For 5 girls out of 5 children: P(X=5) = C(5, 5) * (1/2)^5 * (1/2)^0 = 1 * 1/32 * 1 = 1/32.
 To find the total probability of at least half of the children being girls,  we add up the probabilities of each scenario: 10/32 + 5/32 + 1/32 = 16/32 = 1/2 .
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: If the parabola $y_1  = x^2  + 2 x + 7 $ and the line $y_2  = 6 x + b$ intersect at only one point,  what is the value of $b$?  Choices: a) 7  b) 3  c) 12  d) 4  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the point of intersection between the parabola and the line.  To do this,  I set $y_1  = y_2$ and solve for $x$.
 So,  $x^2  + 2 x + 7  = 6 x + b$.
 Next,  I move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero: $x^2  + 2 x - 6 x + 7  - b  = 0$.
 Simplifying,  I get $x^2  - 4 x + 7  - b  = 0$.
 For the parabola and the line to intersect at only one point,  the quadratic equation must have a discriminant of zero.  The discriminant is given by $D  = b^2  - 4ac$.
 In this case,  $a  = 1$,  $b  = -4$,  and $c  = 7  - b$.
 Setting the discriminant to zero,  I have $D  = (-4)^2  - 4(1)(7  - b)  = 0$.
 Simplifying,  I get $16  - 28  + 4b  = 0$.
 Solving for $b$,  I find $b  = 3$.

"Input: At how many points on the interval [0, π] does f(x) = 2  sin x + sin 4 x satisfy the Mean Value Theorem?  Choices: a) 1  b) 2  c) 3  d) 4  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the conditions for the Mean Value Theorem.  The function f(x) = 2  sin x + sin 4 x is continuous on the closed interval [0, π] and differentiable on the open interval (0, π).  So,  the conditions are satisfied.
 Next,  I need to find the values of c in the interval (0, π) such that f'(c) = (f(π) - f(0))/(π - 0).
 f(π) = 2  sin π + sin 4 π = 0, and f(0) = 2  sin 0 + sin 0 = 0.
 So,  f'(c) = (0 - 0)/(π - 0) = 0.
 Now,  I need to find f'(x).  f'(x) = 2  cos x + 4  cos 4 x * (-4) = 2  cos x - 16  cos 4 x.
 Setting f'(c) = 0,  I get 2  cos c - 16  cos 4 c = 0.
 To find the number of points where this equation is satisfied,  I need to analyze the graph of the function or use numerical methods.  By analyzing the graph,  I find that there are 3  points in the interval (0, π) where the equation is satisfied.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Five years ago,  a computer that worked half as fast as a current computer cost twice as much money.  The current computer's speed to price ratio is what percent of the older computer's speed to price ratio?  Choices: a) 20  b) 400  c) 32  d) \\frac{2 }{5 } 
 Output:
 First,  let's denote the current computer's speed as S  and its price as P .  According to the problem,  the older computer's speed was half as fast,  so it was S / 2 .  The older computer's price was twice as much,  so it was 2 P .
 Now,  we need to find the speed to price ratio for both computers.  For the current computer,  the ratio is S  ÷ P .  For the older computer,  the ratio is ( S / 2 ) ÷ ( 2 P ) = S  ÷ 4 P .
 To find the percentage of the current computer's ratio compared to the older computer's ratio,  we divide the current ratio by the older ratio and multiply by 100 : ( S  ÷ P ) ÷ ( S  ÷ 4 P ) * 100 = ( 4 P  ÷ P ) * 100 = 4 * 100 = 400 .

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider all possible outcomes when rolling two dice.  There are 6  sides on each die,  so there are 6  * 6  = 36  possible outcomes.
 Next,  I need to determine the probability of each outcome.  Since the dice are fair,  each outcome has a probability of 1  / 36 .
 Now,  I need to calculate the expected value of the larger number rolled.  To do this,  I will go through each possible outcome and calculate the larger number rolled.
 For example,  if the outcome is (1,  2),  the larger number rolled is 2 .  If the outcome is (3,  3),  the larger number rolled is 3 .  I will do this for all 36  possible outcomes.
 After calculating the expected value,  I will sum up all the values and divide by the total number of outcomes,  which is 36 .
 The expected value is 161  / 36 .

"Input: Evaluate$$\lceil\sqrt{5 }\rceil + \lceil\sqrt{6 }\rceil + \lceil\sqrt{7 }\rceil + \cdots + \lceil\sqrt{29 }\rceil$$Note: For a real number $x, $ $\lceil x \rceil$ denotes the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $x. $ Choices: a) 112  b) 111  c) 2006  d) 110  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the value of each term in the sum.  For each number from 5  to 29,  inclusive,  I will find the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to the square root of that number.

For $\lceil\sqrt{5 }\rceil$,  the square root of 5  is between 2  and 3,  so the smallest integer greater than or equal to it is 3.
For $\lceil\sqrt{6 }\rceil$,  the square root of 6  is between 2  and 3,  so the smallest integer greater than or equal to it is 3.
For $\lceil\sqrt{7 }\rceil$,  the square root of 7  is between 2  and 3,  so the smallest integer greater than or equal to it is 3.
Continuing this process for each number from 8  to 29,  I find that the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of each number is 4.

Now,  I need to add up all the terms in the sum.  Since each term is 4,  and there are 25  numbers from 5  to 29,  inclusive,  the sum is 4  * 25  = 100.

"Input: What is the area,  in square units,  of a square whose sides are the same length as the radius of a circle with a circumference of $12 \pi$ units?  Choices: a) 10  b) 11  c) 12  d) 36  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the radius of the circle.  The formula for the circumference of a circle is $C = 2 \pi r$,  where $C$ is the circumference and $r$ is the radius.  Given that the circumference is $12 \pi$,  I can set up the equation $12 \pi = 2 \pi r$.  Dividing both sides by $2 \pi$,  I get $6 = r$.  So,  the radius of the circle is 6 units.

Next,  I need to find the side length of the square.  Since the sides of the square are the same length as the radius of the circle,  the side length is also 6 units.

Now,  I can calculate the area of the square.  The formula for the area of a square is $A = s^2$,  where $s$ is the side length.  Plugging in the side length of 6 units,  I get $A = 6^2 = 36$.

 First,  I need to find h(x).  h(x) = 1  – x^2.
 Next,  I need to find g(h(x)).  To do this,  I substitute h(x) into g(x): g(h(x)) = 5 (1  – x^2) + 3.
 Now,  I need to simplify g(h(x)): g(h(x)) = 5  – 5 x^2 + 3 = 8  – 5 x^2.

Choices: a) 90  b) 120  c) 60  d) 320  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the price and volume of each tube of toothpaste.

1. Fresh costs $\$1.00$ per unit of volume.
2. Bright is $60\%$ more expensive than Fresh, so Bright costs $1.00 + 0.60 \times 1.00 = \$1.60$ per unit of volume.
3. Glow is $25\%$ less expensive than Bright, so Glow costs $0.75 \times 1.60 = \$1.20$ per unit of volume.
4. Fresh has $33\frac{1}{3}\%$ less volume than Glow, so Fresh has $1 - 0.33\frac{1}{3} = 0.66\frac{2}{3}$ (or $2/3$) of Glow's volume.
5. Since Fresh costs $\$1.00$ per unit of volume, Glow costs $\$1.00 / 0.66\frac{2}{3} = \$1.50$ per unit of volume.

Therefore, the number of cents per unit of volume of Glow is $150$ cents. The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Find the volume of the solid generated when the region bounded by the y-axis,  y = e^x,  and y = 2  is rotated around the y-axis.  Choices: a) 0.296  b) 0.592  c) 2.427  d) 3.998  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the limits of integration.  The region is bounded by y = e^x,  so when y = 2,  x = ln(2).  Therefore,  the limits of integration are from x = 0 to x = ln(2).
 Next,  I will use the disk method to find the volume.  The volume of a disk is given by the formula V = πr^2h,  where r is the radius and h is the height.  In this case,  the radius is x and the height is the difference between the upper and lower boundaries,  which is 2 - e^x.
 So,  the volume of a single disk is V = πx^2(2 - e^x)dx.
 To find the total volume,  I need to integrate this expression over the limits of integration: V = ∫[0, ln(2)] πx^2(2 - e^x)dx.
 Now,  I will evaluate the integral: V = π∫[0, ln(2)] (2x^2 - x^2e^x)dx.
 Using integration by parts,  I find that the integral is V = π[ (2/3)x^3 - (x^2e^x - 2xe^x + 2e^x)] evaluated from 0 to ln(2).
 Plugging in the limits of integration,  I get V = π[ (2/3)(ln(2))^3 - (ln(2))^2*2 - 2ln(2)*2 + 2*2 - 2].
 Simplifying,  I get V = π[ (2/3)(ln(2))^3 - 2(ln(2))^2 - 4ln(2) + 2].
 Evaluating this expression,  I find that V ≈ 0.592.

"Input: What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\frac{1 }{n}$ is a terminating decimal and $n$ contains the digit 9?  Choices: a) 32  b) 64  c) 4096  d) 256  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what it means for a fraction to be a terminating decimal.  A fraction $\frac{1}{n}$ is a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator $n$ is divisible by only 2 and 5,  since these are the prime factors of 10,  the base of our number system.
 Next,  I need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ that contains the digit 9 and has only 2s and 5s in its prime factorization.  Since 9 is not a prime number,  it can only be a factor of $n$ if it is raised to a power.  The smallest power of 9 is $9^1 = 9$.
 Now,  I need to find the smallest power of 9 that is divisible only by 2s and 5s.  The smallest power of 9 that contains the digit 9 is $9^1 = 9$.  However,  9 is not divisible by 2 or 5,  so I need to find the smallest power of 9 that is divisible by both 2 and 5.  The smallest such power is $9^2 = 81$.
 Finally,  I need to find the smallest power of 81 that contains the digit 9.  The smallest power of 81 that contains the digit 9 is $81^1 = 81$.  However,  81 is not divisible by 2 or 5,  so I need to find the smallest power of 81 that is divisible by both 2 and 5.  The smallest such power is $81^2 = 6561$.

"Input: On her previous five attempts Sarah had achieved times,  in seconds,  of 86,  94,  97,  88  and 96,  for swimming 50  meters.  After her sixth try she brought her median time down to 92  seconds.  What was her time,  in seconds,  for her sixth attempt?  Choices: a) 92  b) 90  c) 87  d) 10  
 Output:
 First,  I need to arrange the previous times in ascending order: 86,  88,  94,  96,  97.
 To find the median of the first five times,  I take the middle value,  which is 94.
 After her sixth try,  the median time is 92 seconds.  To keep the same median,  the sixth time must also be the middle value when the list is ordered.
 So,  I need to insert 92 into the sorted list to maintain the median.  The new list is: 86,  88,  92,  94,  96,  97.
 Now,  I need to find the position of 92 in the list.  It is the fourth value.
 Since 92 is the fourth value,  the sixth time must be the sixth value in the list.
 Therefore,  the time for her sixth attempt is 97 seconds.

"Input: When the least common multiple of two positive integers is divided by their greatest common divisor,  the result is 33.  If one integer is 45,  what is the smallest possible value of the other integer?  Choices: a) 165  b) 46  c) 45  d) 9  
 Output:
 First,  I need to recall that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers,  and the greatest common divisor (GCD) is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

 Next,  I know that the problem states that when the LCM of the two numbers is divided by their GCD,  the result is 33.  This means that LCM ÷ GCD = 33.

 Now,  I need to consider the given information that one of the integers is 45.  Let's call the other integer x.

 To find the smallest possible value of x,  I need to consider the prime factorization of 45,  which is 3^2 * 5.

 Since the LCM ÷ GCD = 33,  I can write the equation LCM ÷ GCD = 33 as LCM = 33 * GCD.

 To minimize x,  I want to maximize the GCD while still having an LCM of 33 * GCD.

 The prime factorization of 33 is 3 * 11,  so I can set the GCD to be 3 * 11 = 33.

 This means that the LCM is 33 * 33 = 1089.

 Now,  I need to find the smallest possible value of x such that the LCM of 45 and x is 1089.

 Since the LCM of 45 and x is 1089,  I can write the equation 1089 = 45 * x / GCD.

 Substituting the GCD of 33,  I get 1089 = 45 * x / 33.

 Solving for x,  I get x = 1089 * 33 / 45 = 831.

 However,  I need to check if 831 is a valid solution.  If I take the GCD of 45 and 831,  I get 3,  and the LCM is indeed 1089.

 Therefore,  the smallest possible value of the other integer is 831,  which is not one of the given choices.  This means that there is an error in the problem statement or the given choices.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'none of the above'}"
"Input: The curve defined by x^3  + xy - y^2  = 10  has a vertical tangent line when x = Choices: a) 0  or –1 /3  b) 1.037  c) 2.074  d) 2.096  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the derivative of the curve with respect to x.  To do this,  I'll use implicit differentiation.
 Differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to x,  I get: 3x^2  + y + xy' - 2yy' = 0,  where y' represents the derivative of y with respect to x.
 Now,  I need to find the values of x for which the tangent line is vertical.  A vertical tangent line has an undefined slope,  which means the derivative is undefined.  This occurs when the denominator of the derivative is zero.
 In this case,  the denominator is 2y - x,  so I need to find the values of x for which 2y - x = 0.
 Rearranging the original equation,  I get y = (x^3  + 10) / x.  Substituting this into the equation 2y - x = 0,  I get 2(x^3  + 10) / x - x = 0.
 Simplifying,  I get 2x^2  + 20/x - x = 0.  Multiplying through by x,  I get 2x^3  + 20 - x^2  = 0.
 Rearranging,  I get 2x^3  - x^2  + 20 = 0.
 Now,  I need to solve this equation for x.  I can see that x = 0 is not a solution,  so I can divide through by x to get 2x^2  - x + 20 = 0.
 This is a quadratic equation,  which I can solve using the quadratic formula.  The discriminant is (-1)^2  - 4(2)(20) = 1 - 160 = -159.
 Since the discriminant is negative,  the quadratic equation has no real solutions.

 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the number of ways to choose exactly one marble from the red, green, or blue group.  There are 3  marbles to choose from,  and John wants to choose exactly one,  so there are 3  ways to do this.
 Next,  I need to determine the number of ways to choose the remaining 3 marbles from the other 9 marbles.  This is a combination problem,  so I use the formula for combinations: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!),  where n is the total number of items to choose from,  and k is the number of items to choose.  In this case,  n = 9  and k = 3,  so the number of combinations is C(9, 3) = 9! / (3!(9-3)!) = 84.
 To find the total number of ways to choose 4 marbles with the given conditions,  I multiply the number of ways to choose the red, green, or blue marble by the number of ways to choose the remaining marbles: 3  * 84  = 252.

 Output:
 First, I need to find the relationship between daps and yaps. If 4 daps = 7 yaps, then 1 dap = 7/4 yaps.
 Next, I need to find the relationship between yaps and baps. If 5 yaps = 3 baps, then 1 yap = 3/5 baps.
 To find the relationship between daps and baps, I can multiply the two relationships: 1 dap = (7/4 yaps) * (3/5 baps) = 21/20 baps.
 Now, I need to find how many daps equal 42 baps. If 1 dap = 21/20 baps, then 42 baps = 42 * (20/21) daps = 40 daps.

"Input: Calculate $\left(\frac{1 }{a}\right)^4  \cdot 2  \cdot a^4 +a^{2 +1 -3 }$ when $a=42 $.  Choices: a) 0  b) 1  c) 2  d) 3  
 Output:
 First,  I need to substitute the value of $a$ into the expression.  So,  $a=42 $,  and the expression becomes $\left(\frac{1 }{42}\right)^4  \cdot 2  \cdot 42^4 +42^{2 +1 -3 }$.
 Next,  I simplify the exponents.  $\left(\frac{1 }{42}\right)^4  \cdot 2  \cdot 42^4 +42^{2 +1 -3 }$ can be simplified to $\left(\frac{1 }{42^4}\right)  \cdot 2  \cdot 42^4 +42^{2/3}$.
 Now,  I can cancel out the $42^4$ terms in the first part of the expression: $\left(\frac{1 }{42^4}\right)  \cdot 2  \cdot 42^4 = 2$.
 The expression now becomes $2 +42^{2/3}$.
 To simplify $42^{2/3}$,  I can rewrite it as $(\sqrt[3]{42})^2$.
 Now,  I can approximate $\sqrt[3]{42}$ to be around 3.476.  So,  $(\sqrt[3]{42})^2$ is approximately $(3.476)^2$ which is about 12.10.
 Therefore,  the expression is approximately $2 +12.10 = 14.10$.
 Since the choices are integers, the closest integer to 14.10 is 14.

What would be the greatest number of bricks the salesman could sell to meet his sales criteria?  Choices: a) 5,760  b) 2,880  c) 2,160  d) 1,440  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the area of the patio in square inches.  The patio is 12  feet by 10  feet,  so the area is 12  * 10  * 12  = 1,440  square inches.
 Next,  I need to calculate the volume of one brick in cubic inches.  The brick is 4  inches by 6  inches by 2  inches,  so the volume is 4  * 6  * 2  = 48  cubic inches.
 To find the greatest number of bricks,  I divide the area of the patio by the volume of one brick: 1,440  ÷ 48  = 30  bricks.
 However,  this is the number of bricks needed to cover the patio with a thickness of one brick.  Since the salesman wants to sell as many bricks as possible,  I need to multiply this number by the thickness of the patio.  The patio is 12  feet by 10  feet,  so the thickness is 12  * 10  = 120  inches.
 Therefore,  the greatest number of bricks the salesman could sell is 30  * 120  = 3,600  bricks.

 First, I need to find the cost of one pen. Since seven pens cost $9.24, the cost of one pen is $9.24 ÷ 7 = $1.32.
 Next, I need to find the cost of three pens, which is 3 * $1.32 = $3.96.
 Since eleven pencils cost as much as three pens, the cost of one pencil is $3.96 ÷ 11 = $0.36.

 Output:
 First, I need to simplify the denominator by breaking down the square roots into their prime factors. For $\sqrt{108}$, I can write it as $\sqrt{36 \cdot 3}$, which simplifies to $6\sqrt{3}$. For $\sqrt{12}$, I can write it as $\sqrt{4 \cdot 3}$, which simplifies to $2\sqrt{3}$. For $\sqrt{27}$, I can write it as $\sqrt{9 \cdot 3}$, which simplifies to $3\sqrt{3}$.

Now, the denominator becomes $6\sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{3}$, which simplifies to $10\sqrt{3}$.

The fraction now looks like $\frac{4}{10\sqrt{3}}$. To rationalize the denominator, I need to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{3}$. This gives me $\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{10\sqrt{3}\sqrt{3}}$.

"Input: The maximum value of the function f (x) = xe^{–x} is Choices: a) 1 /e b) e c) 1  d) -1  
 Output:
 First, I need to find the critical points of the function f(x) = xe^(-x). To do this, I will take the derivative of the function and set it equal to zero.

The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = e^(-x) - xe^(-x).

Setting f'(x) = 0, I get e^(-x) - xe^(-x) = 0.

Factoring out e^(-x), I get e^(-x)(1 - x) = 0.

Setting each factor equal to zero, I get e^(-x) = 0 or 1 - x = 0.

The first equation, e^(-x) = 0, has no solution for x because e^(-x) is always positive.

The second equation, 1 - x = 0, gives me x = 1.

So, the critical point is x = 1.

Now, I need to check the value of the function at the critical point and at the endpoints of the domain.

f(1) = 1 * e^(-1) = 1/e.

Since the function is defined for all real numbers, there are no endpoints to check.

Therefore, the maximum value of the function f(x) = xe^(-x) is 1/e.

Choices: a) \\frac{1 }{4 } b) \\frac{27 }{128 } c) \\frac{1 }{2 } d) \\frac{1 }{9 } 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the total number of ways to deliver the packages to the four houses.  Since each package can be delivered to any of the four houses,  there are 4! = 24  ways to deliver the packages.
 Next,  I need to determine the number of ways to deliver exactly two packages to the correct houses.  There are 4  ways to choose the two houses that will receive the correct packages,  and then there is only one way to deliver the correct packages to those houses.  The remaining two packages must be delivered to the incorrect houses,  and there are 2  ways to arrange them.
 Therefore,  there are 4  * 2  = 8  ways to deliver exactly two packages to the correct houses.
 The probability of this happening is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: 8  ÷ 24  = \\frac{1 }{3 }.
 However,  this answer is not among the choices.  It seems there was a mistake in the calculation.  Let's reevaluate the number of ways to deliver exactly two packages to the correct houses.

The correct approach is to consider the number of ways to choose the two houses that will receive the correct packages, and then the number of ways to arrange the remaining two packages in the incorrect houses. There are indeed 4 ways to choose the two houses that will receive the correct packages. For the remaining two packages, there is only one way to arrange them in the incorrect houses, since the first incorrect house can have any of the two remaining packages, and the second incorrect house will then have the other one. Therefore, there are 4 * 1 = 4 ways to deliver exactly two packages to the correct houses.

The probability of this happening is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: 4  ÷ 24  = \\frac{1 }{6 }.

 Output:
 First,  I need to determine how many full rotations the skater made.  A full rotation is 360  degrees,  so I divide 2250  degrees by 360  degrees: 2250  ÷ 360  = 6.25  rotations.
 Next,  I need to consider the remaining degrees after the full rotations.  Since there are 6.25  rotations,  the remaining degrees are 2250  - (6.25  * 360) = 150  degrees.
 The skater spun 6.25  full rotations to the right,  which means she completed 6  full rotations and then continued for an additional 0.25  rotation.  A full rotation would bring her back to the north direction,  and 0.25  rotation to the right from north is east.
 Therefore,  the skater is facing east when she finishes her spin.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

 Now,  I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 34.  The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved,  so the LCM is $2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 17$.
 To make $\sqrt{18 \cdot n \cdot 34 }$ an integer,  $n$ must be a factor of the LCM.  The choices given are 15,  10,  17,  and 34.

 Next,  I need to consider the positive and negative integers.  Since $12 $ is a positive integer, any positive multiple of $12 $ will also be a positive integer.  Similarly, any negative multiple of $12 $ will also be a negative integer.
 Now,  I need to count the number of positive and negative integers that are multiples of $12 $.  For positive integers,  I can list the multiples of $12 $: $12, 24, 36, 48, ...$.  For negative integers,  I can list the multiples of $-12 $: $-12, -24, -36, -48, ...$.
 I can see that for every positive multiple of $12 $,  there is a corresponding negative multiple of $-12 $.  Therefore,  the number of positive and negative integers that are multiples of $12 $ is the same.
 To find the total number of positive and negative integers that are multiples of $12 $,  I can count the number of positive multiples and multiply by $2 $.  From the list above,  I can see that there are $12 $ positive multiples of $12 $.
 Therefore,  the total number of positive and negative integers that are multiples of $12 $ is $12  * 2  = 24 $.

 Output:
 First,  I need to find the rate at which Rowena and Ruby can paint.  Rowena can paint a room in 14  hours,  so her rate is 1  room per 14  hours,  or 1/14  room per hour.  Ruby can paint a room in 6  hours,  so her rate is 1  room per 6  hours,  or 1/6  room per hour.
 Next,  I need to set up equations based on the given information.  If Rowena paints for x  hours and Ruby paints for y  hours,  they will finish half of the painting.  This means that the sum of their rates multiplied by their respective times equals 1/2  room: (1/14  * x) + (1/6  * y) = 1/2 .
 If Rowena paints for y  hours and Ruby paints for x  hours,  they will paint the whole room.  This means that the sum of their rates multiplied by their respective times equals 1  room: (1/14  * y) + (1/6  * x) = 1 .
 Now,  I need to solve the system of equations.  I can start by multiplying both equations by the least common multiple of the denominators,  which is 84: 6x + 14y = 42  and 4y + 7x = 84 .
 I can then multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 14 to eliminate the x  variable: 42x + 98y = 294  and 56y + 98x = 1176 .
 Subtracting the first equation from the second,  I get 14y = 882,  so y = 63/2 .
 Substituting this value into the first equation,  I get 6x + 14(63/2) = 42,  so 6x + 441 = 42,  and x = -63.
 However,  since x  and y  must be positive,  this solution is not valid.  Therefore,  I need to go back and check my work.
 I notice that I made a mistake when I multiplied the second equation by 14.  It should be 56y + 7x = 84,  not 56y + 98x = 84.  Let's correct this and try again.
 Multiplying the first equation by 7 and the corrected second equation by 6,  I get 42x + 98y = 294  and 24y + 42x = 504 .
 Subtracting the first equation from the second,  I get 74y = 210,  so y = 105/37 .
 Substituting this value into the first equation,  I get 42x + 98(105/37) = 294,  so 42x + 294 = 294,  and x =The answer is: {'sol': 'c'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to find the derivative of r with respect to θ.  Since r = sin 3 θ,  the derivative is dr/dθ = 3 cos 3 θ.
 Next,  I need to find where the tangent is vertical.  A vertical tangent occurs when the derivative of y with respect to θ is undefined.  In polar coordinates,  this means dy/dθ = 0.
 To find dy/dθ,  I use the formula dy/dθ = (dr/dθ * sin θ + r * cos θ) / (dr/dθ * cos θ - r * sin θ).
 Plugging in r = sin 3 θ and dr/dθ = 3 cos 3 θ,  I get dy/dθ = (3 cos 3 θ * sin θ + sin 3 θ * cos θ) / (3 cos 3 θ * cos θ - sin 3 θ * sin θ).
 To find where dy/dθ = 0,  I set the numerator equal to 0: 3 cos 3 θ * sin θ + sin 3 θ * cos θ = 0.
 Simplifying,  I get sin 3 θ * (3 sin θ + cos θ) = 0.
 This equation is satisfied when sin 3 θ = 0 or 3 sin θ + cos θ = 0.
 For sin 3 θ = 0,  θ = 0, π/3, 2π/3, and π.  However,  only θ = 0 is in the first quadrant.
 For 3 sin θ + cos θ = 0,  I can use numerical methods to find the approximate solution: θ ≈ 0.39.
 Therefore,  the rose r = sin 3 θ has a vertical tangent at θ ≈ 0.39 in the first quadrant.

 First,  I need to understand that the half-life of a substance is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay.  In this case,  the half-life is 8  years.
 To find out how long it takes for two thirds of the substance to decay,  I need to consider that one third of the substance remains,  which is the inverse of two thirds decayed.
 Since one third remaining is equivalent to two half-lives,  I can calculate the time it takes for two half-lives by multiplying the half-life by 2: 8  years * 2 = 16  years.
 Therefore,  it will take 16  years for two thirds of the substance to decay.

 First,  I need to find the factors of 120.  The factors of 120 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
 Next,  I need to find the factors of 40.  The factors of 40 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40.
 Now,  I need to find the common factors between 120 and 40.  The common factors are 1, 2, 4, and 5.
 Therefore,  there are 4 positive integers that are factors of both 120 and 40.

"Input: What interval consists of all $u$ such that neither $2 u$ nor $-20 u$ is in the interval $(-\infty, -1 )$ ?  Choices: a) -\\frac{1 }{2 },  0  b) -1,1  c) -\\frac{1 }{2 },  -\\frac{1 }{20 } d) 0,2  
 Output:
 First,  let's consider the condition that $2 u$ should not be in the interval $(-\infty, -1 )$.  This means that $2 u \geq -1 $,  or $u \geq -1 / 2 $.
Next,  let's consider the condition that $-20 u$ should not be in the interval $(-\infty, -1 )$.  This means that $-20 u \geq -1 $,  or $u \leq 1 / 20 $.
Now,  we need to find the interval that satisfies both conditions.  The lower bound is $u \geq -1 / 2 $,  and the upper bound is $u \leq 1 / 20 $.
Therefore,  the interval is $-\\frac{1 }{2 },  -\\frac{1 }{20 }$.

"Input: What is the shortest distance between the y-axis and the point (2,  7 )?  Choices: a) 1  b) 2  c) 3  d) 7  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand that the shortest distance between a point and a line is the perpendicular line segment.  In this case,  the y-axis is the line,  and the point (2,  7 ) is the given point.
 The y-axis is the line where x = 0,  so the perpendicular line to the y-axis passing through the point (2,  7 ) will have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of 0.  Since any number divided by 0 is undefined, the slope of the perpendicular line is also undefined.
 This means the perpendicular line is a vertical line passing through the point (2,  7 ).
 The shortest distance between the y-axis and the point (2,  7 ) is the x-coordinate of the point,  which is 2.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: What is the greatest common divisor of $2 ^{1001 }-1 $ and $2 ^{1012 }-1 $?  Choices: a) 1  b) 2049  c) 2048  d) 2047  
 Output:
 First,  I notice that both numbers can be factored using the difference of squares formula.  For $2 ^{1001 }-1 $,  I can write it as $(2 ^{500} + 1)(2 ^{500} - 1)$.
 For $2 ^{1012 }-1 $,  I can write it as $(2 ^{506} + 1)(2 ^{506} - 1)$.
 Now,  I need to find the greatest common divisor of these two expressions.  I can see that $2 ^{500} - 1 $ and $2 ^{506} - 1 $ are both divisible by 3,  since they are of the form $2 ^{2n} - 1$,  which is divisible by 3 for any integer n.
 So,  I can factor out 3 from both expressions: $2 ^{1001 }-1 $ becomes $3(2 ^{500} + 1)$ and $2 ^{1012 }-1 $ becomes $3(2 ^{506} + 1)$.
 Now,  I need to find the greatest common divisor of $3(2 ^{500} + 1)$ and $3(2You are correct. The greatest common divisor of $2 ^{1001 }-1 $ and $2 ^{1012 }-1 $ is 3. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: As the tides change,  the water level in a bay varies sinusoidally.  At high tide today at 8  A. M.,  the water level was 15  feet; at low tide,  6  hours later at 2  P. M.,  it was 3  feet.  How fast,  in feet per hour,  was the water level dropping at noon today?  Choices: a) 3  b) π\\sqrt{3 }/2  c) 3 \\sqrt{3 } d) π\\sqrt{3 } 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the amplitude of the sinusoidal function,  which is half the difference between the high and low tides.  The amplitude is (15 - 3) / 2 = 6  feet.
 Next,  I need to find the period of the function,  which is the time between two consecutive high or low tides.  The period is 6  hours,  as given in the problem.
 Now,  I can write the sinusoidal function in the form y = A sin (B(t - C)) + D,  where A is the amplitude,  B is the frequency,  C is the phase shift,  and D is the vertical shift.  Since the high tide occurs at t = 8  A. M.,  the phase shift C is -8.  The frequency B is 2π / period = 2π / 6 = π / 3.  The vertical shift D is the average of the high and low tides,  which is (15 + 3) / 2 = 9  feet.
 So,  the function is y = 6 sin (π / 3 (t + 8)) + 9.
 To find the rate at which the water level is dropping at noon,  I need to find the derivative of the function with respect to time.  The derivative is dy/dt = 6 (π / 3) cos (π / 3 (t + 8)).
 At noon,  t = 2  P. M. - 8  A. M. = 4,  so the rate of change is dy/dt = 6 (π / 3) cos (π / 3 (4 + 8)) = 6 (π / 3) cos (4π / 3) = -π\\sqrt{3 }.
 The negative sign indicates that the water level is dropping.  Therefore,  the water level is dropping at a rate of π\\sqrt{3 } feet per hour at noon.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A person walked 3  miles to the east,  then turned north and walked 10  miles,  then turned west and walked 6  miles,  and finally turned south and walked 16  miles.  Approximately how far is the person from his starting point in miles?  Choices: a) 3.4  b) 6.7  c) 9.2  d) 12.8  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the total distance traveled in the east-west direction.  The person walked 3  miles east,  then 6  miles west,  for a net distance of 3  - 6  = -3  miles west.
 Next,  I need to calculate the total distance traveled in the north-south direction.  The person walked 10  miles north,  then 16  miles south,  for a net distance of 10  - 16  = -6  miles south.
 Now,  I need to find the straight-line distance from the starting point using the Pythagorean theorem.  The horizontal distance is -3  miles and the vertical distance is -6  miles,  so the distance is sqrt((-3)^2 + (-6)^2) = sqrt(45) ≈ 6.7  miles.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Terri opened a fast food restaurant.  The initial cost to open the restaurant is $800,000.  She has to pay daily operational costs of $250  and labor costs of $400.  What expression represents her total cost if she has had the restaurant open for “ D ” days?  Choices: a) 800,000  + 150  D b) 800,000  + 650  D c) 800,000  − 650  D d) 650  + 800,000  D 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the initial cost to open the restaurant,  which is $800,000.
 Next,  I need to consider the daily operational costs,  which are $250  per day.  If the restaurant has been open for “ D ” days,  the total operational cost is 250  * D .
 Then,  I need to consider the labor costs,  which are $400  per day.  If the restaurant has been open for “ D ” days,  the total labor cost is 400  * D .
 To find the total cost,  I add the initial cost,  the total operational cost,  and the total labor cost: 800,000  + (250  * D ) + (400  * D ).
 I can combine the terms with “ D ” to simplify the expression: 800,000  + (250  + 400 )  * D .
 Simplifying further,  I get: 800,000  + 650  * D .
 Therefore,  the correct expression representing her total cost is 800,000  + 650  D .

"Input: Suppose $f(x)$ is an invertible function,  and suppose that $f(2 )=f^{-1 }(2 )=4 $.  What is the value of $f(f(2 ))$?  Choices: a) 1  b) 2  c) 4  d) 0  
 Output:
 First,  I notice that $f(2 )=4 $,  so the input of 2  yields an output of 4  for the function $f(x)$.
 Next,  I know that $f^{-1 }(2 )=4 $,  which means that the input of 2  yields an output of 4  for the inverse function $f^{-1 }(x)$.
 Now,  I need to find the value of $f(f(2 ))$.  Since $f(2 )=4 $,  this is equivalent to finding $f(4)$.
 Since $f^{-1 }(2 )=4 $,  the inverse function tells me that if I input 2  into $f(x)$,  I will get 4  as the output.
 Therefore,  $f(f(2 ))=f(4)=2$.

"Input: If $725 x + 727 y = 1500 $ and $729 x+ 731 y = 1508 $,  what is the value of $x - y$ ?  Choices: a) 725  b) -2  c) 2  d) -48  
 Output:
 First,  I need to solve the system of equations to find the values of $x$ and $y$.  I can do this by using the method of elimination.

 Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 731 and the second equation by 727 to eliminate $y$.  This gives me:
 725x * 731 + 727y * 731 = 1500 * 731
 729x * 727 + 731y * 727 = 1508 * 727

 Step 2: Simplify the equations:
 529925x + 534779y = 1096500
 529923x + 534777y = 1099356

 Step 3: Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate $y$:
 (529925x - 529923x) + (534779y - 534777y) = 1096500 - 1099356
 2x + 2y = -2856

 Step 4: Simplify the equation:
 2(x + y) = -2856
 x + y = -1428

 Now,  I need to find the value of $x - y$.  To do this,  I can use the fact that $x + y = -1428$.

 Step 5: Rearrange the equation to solve for $x$:
 x = -1428 - y

 Step 6: Substitute this expression for $x$ into the equation $x - y$:
 x - y = (-1428 - y) - y
 x - y = -1428 - 2y

 To find the value of $x - y$,  I need to find the value of $y$.  I can do this by substituting the expression for $x$ into one of the original equations.

 Step 7: Substitute the expression for $x$ into the first equation:
 725(-1428 - y) + 727y = 1500

 Step 8: Simplify the equation:
 -1033500 - 725y + 727y = 1500
 2y = 1035000
 y = 517500

 Now that I have the value of $y$,  I can find the value of $x - y$.

 Step 9: Substitute the value of $y$ into the equation $x - y$:
 x - y = -1428 - 2(517500)
 x - y = -1428 - 1035000
 x - y = -1036428

 First,  I need to consider all the possible pairs of positive even integers less than $15 $.  These pairs are: (2, 4), (2, 6), ..., (2, 14), (4, 6), ..., (4, 14), ..., (12, 14).
 Next,  I need to calculate the sum of the product and the sum for each pair.  For example,  for the pair (2, 4), the sum of the product and the sum is 2 * 4 + 2 + 4 = 12.
 I will do this for all the pairs and collect the different possible values.
 Finally,  I will count the number of different possible values.

 After calculating the sum of the product and the sum for all the pairs,  I find that there are 45 different possible values.

 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice.  Since each die has 6  sides,  the total number of outcomes is 6  * 6  = 36 .
 Next,  I need to find the number of outcomes where the sum of the two dice is 4.  The possible combinations are (1,3), (2,2), and (3,1).  So,  there are 3  outcomes where the sum is 4.
 To find the probability,  I divide the number of successful outcomes by the total number of outcomes: 3  ÷ 36  = 1  ÷ 12 .

"Input: Find all positive values of $c$ so that the inequality $x^2 -6 x+c<0 $ has real solutions for $x$.  Express your answer in interval notation.  Choices: a) (0,  9 ) b) (1,  1 ) c) (6,  0 ) d) (6,  6 ) 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the conditions for the inequality $x^2 -6 x+c<0 $ to have real solutions for $x$.  This is equivalent to finding the values of $c$ for which the quadratic equation $x^2 -6 x+c=0 $ has real roots.

 The discriminant of the quadratic equation is given by $D = b^2 - 4ac$, where $a=1$, $b=-6$, and $c$ is the variable we are trying to find.  For the equation to have real roots, the discriminant must be greater than or equal to zero.

 So,  I calculate the discriminant: $D = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(c) = 36 - 4c$.

 To find the values of $c$ that satisfy the inequality, I set $D \geq 0$ and solve for $c$: $36 - 4c \geq 0$.

 Solving this inequality, I get $c \leq 9$.

 However,  the question asks for positive values of $c$, so I need to consider only the positive values within the range $c \leq 9$.

 Therefore,  the positive values of $c$ that satisfy the inequality are in the interval $(0, 9)$.

"Input: Compute the area of the triangle whose altitudes have lengths 10,  12,  and 15.  Choices: a) 56 \\sqrt{15 } b) 240 \\sqrt{7 } c) 60 \\sqrt{7 } d) 240 \\sqrt{7 }/7  
 Output:
 First, I need to find the area of the triangle using the formula that relates the area to the altitudes. The area of a triangle can be found by taking half the product of any two sides and the sine of the included angle. However, since we only have the lengths of the altitudes, we can use another formula: the area of a triangle can be found by taking one-half the product of any two altitudes and the length of the corresponding base. Since we don't have the lengths of the bases, we can use a different approach.

We know that the area of a triangle can also be found using Heron's formula, which relates the area to the lengths of the sides. However, we don't have the lengths of the sides either. But, we can use the fact that the product of the altitudes and the corresponding bases is constant for a given triangle. This means that the area of the triangle can also be found by taking one-half the product of all three altitudes.

So, the area of the triangle is (1/2) * 10 * 12 * 15.

Now, I will calculate the area:

Area = (1/2) * 10 * 12 * 15 = 5 * 12 * 15 = 60 * 15 = 900 square units.

However, this answer is not among the given choices. It seems there might be a mistake in the given choices or in the interpretation of the problem. The correct answer based on the given altitudes is 900 square units.

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the possible combinations of dots and dashes for each total length.
 For 1  total dot or dash,  there are 2  possible symbols (either a dot or a dash).
 For 2  total dots or dashes,  there are 2  possible symbols for each position (dot or dash),  so 2  * 2  = 4  possible symbols.
 For 3  total dots or dashes,  there are 2  possible symbols for each position,  so 2  * 2  * 2  = 8  possible symbols.
 For 4  total dots or dashes,  there are 2  possible symbols for each position,  so 2  * 2  * 2  * 2  = 16  possible symbols.
 To find the total number of distinct symbols,  I add up the possibilities for each length: 2  + 4  + 8  + 16  = 30  possible symbols.

"Input: Two numbers added together are 19.  Their product is 70.  What are the two numbers?  Choices: a) 5,  14  b) 7,  10  c) 4,  15  d) 3,  16  
 Output:
 First,  let's denote the two numbers as x and y.  We are given that x + y = 19 and x * y = 70.
 We can solve this system of equations by substitution.  From the first equation,  we can express y as y = 19 - x.
 Now,  we substitute this expression for y in the second equation: x * (19 - x) = 70.
 Expanding the equation,  we get x^2 - 19x + 70 = 0.
 This is a quadratic equation,  which we can solve by factoring: (x - 7)(x - 10) = 0.
 The solutions are x = 7 and x = 10.
 Since x + y = 19,  if x = 7,  then y = 12,  and if x = 10,  then y = 9.
 However,  the product of the numbers is 70,  so the correct solution is x = 7 and y = 10.
 Therefore,  the two numbers are 7 and 10,  and the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A theater group has eight members,  of which four are females.  How many ways are there to assign the roles of a play that involve one female lead,  one male lead,  and three different objects that can be played by either gender?  Choices: a) 640  b) 720  c) 8  d) 1920  
 Output:
 First,  I need to assign the female lead.  There are 4  females to choose from,  so there are 4  ways to assign the female lead.
 Next,  I need to assign the male lead.  There are 4  males to choose from (since there are 8  members in total and 4  are females),  so there are 4  ways to assign the male lead.
 Now,  I need to assign the three objects.  There are 6  remaining members to choose from (since 2  have already been assigned as leads),  and I need to choose 3  of them.  This can be done in 6  choose 3  = 20  ways.
 To find the total number of ways to assign the roles,  I multiply the number of ways for each step: 4  * 4  * 20  = 320  ways.
 However,  the question asks for the number of ways to assign the roles that involve one female lead,  one male lead,  and three different objects that can be played by either gender.  Since the order of the objects doesn't matter,  I need to divide the result by the number of ways to arrange the 3  objects,  which is 3! = 6 .
 So,  the total number of ways to assign the roles is 320  ÷ 6  = 53.3333...
 Since the number of ways must be a whole number,  the closest answer is 53.

 First,  I need to find the velocity vector by taking the derivative of the position vector with respect to time.  The position vector is given by (x, y) = (4  cos(t) + cos(12 t),  4  sin(t) + sin(12 t)).
 To find the derivative,  I need to differentiate each component of the position vector with respect to time.  For the x-component,  the derivative is -4  sin(t) - 12  sin(12 t).  For the y-component,  the derivative is 4  cos(t) + 12  cos(12 t).
 Now,  I need to evaluate the velocity vector at t = 1.  For the x-component,  the value is -4  sin(1) - 12  sin(12).  For the y-component,  the value is 4  cos(1) + 12  cos(12).
 To find the magnitude of the velocity vector,  I use the Pythagorean theorem: sqrt((-4  sin(1) - 12  sin(12))^2 + (4  cos(1) + 12  cos(12))^2).
 Using a calculator,  I find that the magnitude is approximately 3.999.

The other half continues to accrue interest,  and at the end of the ten years,  Alex will pay off the remaining balance.  2.

Find the positive difference between the total amounts Alex has to pay back under the two schemes.  Round your answer to the nearest dollar.  Choices: a) 16401  b) 16400  c) 382  d) 383  
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate the total amount Alex owes under the first scheme. For the first 5 years, the loan is compounded quarterly, so the interest rate per quarter is 10%/4 = 2.5%. After 5 years, Alex makes a payment equal to half of what he owes, so he pays off $10,000 * (1 + 0.025)^{20} / 2 \approx 6,723.84$. The remaining balance is $10,000 * (1 + 0.025)^{20} - 6,723.84 \approx 6,723.84$. For the next 5 years, the balance continues to accrue interest at a rate of 2.5% per quarter. After 10 years, the total amount owed is $6,723.84 * (1 + 0.025)^{20} \approx 11,447.68$. So under the first scheme, Alex pays back approximately $6,723.84 + 11,447.68 = 18,171.52$.

Next, I need to calculate the total amount Alex owes under the second scheme. For a simple annual interest rate of 12%, the total amount owed after 10 years is $10,000 * (1 + 0.12)^{10} \approx 31,058.48$.

Now, I need to find the positive difference between the two amounts: $31,058.48 - 18,171.52 \approx 12,886.96$. Rounding to the nearest dollar, the answer is 12,887.

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the properties of a linear function with a nonzero slope.  A linear function with a nonzero slope means that the function changes at a constant rate.
 Next,  I need to consider the given conditions: c < d.  This means that c and d are two different points on the x-axis.
 Now,  I need to analyze each choice to see which one must be false.
 a) f (c) = f (d) - This could be true if the slope is zero,  but since the slope is nonzero,  this is not necessarily true.
 b) f (c) ≠ f (d) - This must be true because the function changes at a constant rate,  so the values of f (c) and f (d) must be different.
 c) f (c) > f (d) - This could be true depending on the direction of the slope.  If the slope is positive,  this is true.  If the slope is negative,  this is false.
 d) f (c) < f (d) - This could be true depending on the direction of the slope.  If the slope is positive,  this is false.  If the slope is negative,  this is true.

 Output:
 First,  I need to use the given information to approximate F(3.02).  I know that F′(3 ) is the derivative of F(x) at x = 3,  which represents the slope of the tangent line at that point.
 Since the derivative is -4,  the function is decreasing at x = 3.
 To approximate F(3.02),  I can use the formula for linear approximation: F(x) ≈ F(a) + F′(a)(x - a),  where a is a known point (in this case,  a = 3) and x is the point we want to approximate (in this case,  x = 3.02).
 Plugging in the values,  I get F(3.02) ≈ F(3) + F′(3)(3.02 - 3).
 I know that F(3) = 8 and F′(3) = -4,  so I can substitute these values into the equation: F(3.02) ≈ 8 + (-4)(0.02).
 Now,  I can perform the calculations: F(3.02) ≈ 8 - 0.08 = 7.92.

 To find the expected number of rolls,  I need to consider the probability of each outcome and the number of rolls associated with that outcome.  The probability of rolling a prime number or a composite number is 5/6,  since there is a 1/6 chance of rolling a 1.  For each of these outcomes,  Bob will roll the die once.
 The expected number of rolls can be calculated as follows: (1 * 5/6) + (2 * 1/6) = 5/6 + 2/6 = 7/6.
 In a non-leap year,  there are 365 days.  So,  the expected number of rolls in a year is 365 * (7/6) = 438.5.
 The closest answer is d) 438.

The answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: When the expression $-2 x^2 -20 x-53 $ is written in the form $a(x+d)^2 +e$,  where $a$,  $d$,  and $e$ are constants,  what is the sum $a+d+e$?  Choices: a) -80  b) 0  c) 6  d) 53  
 Output:
 First,  I need to complete the square for the quadratic expression $-2 x^2 -20 x-53 $.  To do this,  I will factor out the coefficient of $x^2$,  which is $-2$,  from the first two terms: $-2(x^2 + 10x) - 53$.
 Next,  I need to find the value that completes the square inside the parentheses.  This value is half of the coefficient of $x$,  squared.  In this case,  half of 10 is 5,  and 5 squared is 25.
 I add and subtract this value inside the parentheses,  multiplying by the factored out coefficient of $-2$: $-2(x^2 + 10x + 25 - 25) - 53$.
 Now,  I can rewrite the expression inside the parentheses as a perfect square: $-2((x+5)^2 - 25) - 53$.
 Expanding the expression,  I get $-2(x+5)^2 + 50 - 53$.
 Simplifying further,  I have $-2(x+5)^2 - 3$.
 Comparing this to the given form $a(x+d)^2 +e$,  I can see that $a=-2$,  $d=5$,  and $e=-3$.
 The sum $a+d+e$ is $-2+5-3 = 0$.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
