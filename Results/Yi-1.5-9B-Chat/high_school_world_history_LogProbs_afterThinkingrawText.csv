 No task is more urgent than that of preserving peace.  Without peace our independence means little.  The rehabilitation and upbuilding of our countries will have little meaning.  Our revolutions will not be allowed to run their course.  What can we do?  We can do much!  We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs.  We can mobilize all the spiritual,  all the moral,  all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace.  Yes,  we!  We,  the peoples of Asia and Africa,  1.4  billion strong.

 Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs.  China
 In Western Europe during the 1200 s through the 1400 s,  early cannons,  as heavy and as slow to fire as they were,  proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move.  By contrast,  China,  especially after the mid-1300 s,  was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads,  against whom early gunpowder weapons,  with their unwieldiness,  proved of little utility.  It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
 The argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?  Choices: a) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other b) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era c) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500  C. E.  d) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion 
 Output:
 First,  I will analyze the passage to identify the main theme.  The passage discusses the development of gunpowder weaponry in Europe and China during the 1200s through the 1400s.  It highlights the different contexts in which these advancements were made, with Europe focusing on improving cannons for sieges and China focusing on improving horse archery units for dealing with mobile nomads.

Next,  I will compare each choice to the main theme of the passage.  Choice a) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other is not directly related to the passage, as it does not discuss the sharing of technologies between societies.

Choice b) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era is partially related to the passage, but it extends beyond the time period discussed (1200s-1400s) and focuses on modern military superiority, not the specific development of gunpowder weaponry.

Choice c) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E. is not directly related to the passage, as it discusses economic factors rather than the development of gunpowder weaponry.

Choice d) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion is not related to the passage, as it discusses a climatic factor rather than the development of gunpowder weaponry or military strategies.

Based on the analysis,  the argument in the passage most closely relates to choice b) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era, although it is not the most accurate choice due to the focus on gunpowder weaponry development rather than overall military superiority.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: This question refers to the following information.
 The city of Ghana consists of two towns.  One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques,  salaried imams and muezzins,  and jurists and scholars.  In the environs are wells with sweet water,  from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables.  .  .  .  The king's interpreters,  the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims.  Only royalty may wear sewn clothes.  All other people wear robes of cotton,  silk,  or brocade,  according to their means.  .  .  .  The king adorns himself like a woman,  wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms.  .  .  .  He sits .  .  .  in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses.  When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads,  for this is their way of greeting him.  As for the Muslims,  they greet him only by clapping their hands.  [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols.  .  .  .  On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar,  and two dinars when it is sent out.  From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals,  and from a load of other goods ten mithqals.  .  .  .  The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king,  only this gold dust being left for the people.  But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value.  Beyond this country lies another called Malal,  the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam,  while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists.  Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani .

 What evidence is there in the passage that Ghanians were engaged,  directly or indirectly,  in trade with Asia?  Choices: a) They kept horses in their court,  which would have come from the Mongols.  b) The Ghanian king had adopted the Chinese tradition of the kow-tow .  c) The king adorned himself with gold and jewels,  probably from India.  d) The people in his court wore silk robes.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the parts of the passage that mention trade with Asia.  The passage mentions that the Ghanian king adorns himself with gold and jewels,  which suggests that these items were imported from somewhere.  Gold and jewels from India were highly valued in the Middle Ages,  so it is possible that these were sourced from India.
 The passage also mentions that the people in the Ghanian court wore silk robes.  Silk was a valuable commodity in the Middle Ages and was primarily produced in China.  The passage does not explicitly mention that the silk was imported from China,  but it is reasonable to infer that it was,  given the high value of silk and the historical trade between China and other regions.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 Like numerous other leaders in Africa,  Asia,  and the Middle East,  Sukarno attempted,  but did not completely succeed,  in maintaining a neutral stance during Choices: a) the Arab-Israeli conflict.  b) the Korean War.  c) the Cold War.  d) the Vietnam conflicts.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the context of the quote.  The quote is from Indonesian leader Sukarno's keynote address to the Bandung Conference in 1955.
 Next,  I need to determine which conflict the quote refers to.  The quote discusses the importance of peace and the need to mobilize the strength of Asia and Africa for peace.
 Now,  I need to consider the time period of the Bandung Conference and the conflicts mentioned in the choices.  The Bandung Conference took place in 1955,  while the Korean War occurred from 1950 to 1953,  the Cold War started in 1947 and lasted until 1991,  and the Vietnam conflicts began in the 1950s and continued into the 1970s.
 Therefore,  the conflict that fits the context of the quote and the time period of the Bandung Conference is the Cold War.

"Input: This question refers to the following information.
 Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept.  He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive.  He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea,  or were already there.  The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa,  600  miles away.  His problem,  therefore,  was to compose a surrender arrangement which,  while acceptable to the Russians,  would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea.  If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea,  the United States would be unable to stop them.  .  .  .  He decided to use the 38 th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.

 How did the events depicted here affect Koreans?  Choices: a) They became a part of Japanâ€™s territory.  b) The Americans established freedom for all Koreans.  c) The Korean economy never recovered.  d) Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38 th parallel.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the question.  The text describes a situation where Colonel Bonesteel was trying to establish a surrender zone for Japanese forces in Korea,  with the 38 th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones for American and Russian authorities.
 The question asks how these events affected Koreans.  The text does not mention any negative impact on the Korean economy or any long-lasting negative consequences for Koreans.  It does not mention that the Americans established freedom for all Koreans either.
 However,  the text does mention that the 38 th parallel was used as a line dividing the zones for surrendering to American and Russian authorities.  This implies that Korea was divided into two nations near the 38 th parallel.

 Dickens's and Wordsworth's differing views about the French Revolution can be described,  respectively,  by which of the following adjectives?  Choices: a) Optimistic,  encouraged b) Understanding,  accepting c) Cynical,  enthusiastic d) Sincere,  resigned 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key themes in both authors' descriptions of the French Revolution.  In Charles Dickens's quote,  the French Revolution is described as a time of both light and darkness,  hope and despair,  and is characterized by the superlative degree of comparison.  This suggests a complex and multifaceted view of the revolution.
 Next,  in William Wordsworth's quote,  the French Revolution is described as a time of great enthusiasm and joy,  with the phrase ""very heaven"" indicating a highly positive view of the revolution.
 Now,  I need to match these themes to the given adjectives.  For Charles Dickens,  the most fitting adjective is 'c) Cynical,  enthusiastic',  as his view of the French Revolution is complex and multifaceted,  reflecting both the negative and positive aspects of the period.
 For William Wordsworth,  the most fitting adjective is 'a) Optimistic,  encouraged',  as his view of the French Revolution is highly positive and enthusiastic.

 Which of the following observations about revolutions and gender is best supported by the first passage?  Choices: a) Revolutionary progressivism does not always concern itself with gender equality.  b) Women typically assume leadership roles during times of revolution.  c) Women rarely support revolutions and therefore receive little benefit from them.  d) Revolutionary movements are generally uninterested in women's rights.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze the content of the first passage,  which is Olympe de Gouges' ""Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen.""  The passage emphasizes the need for women to wake up to the reality of their rights and to oppose injustice.  It calls for women to actively participate in the fight for freedom and equality.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given and see which one is best supported by the passage.  Choice a) Revolutionary progressivism does not always concern itself with gender equality.  This statement is supported by the fact that the passage explicitly addresses the need for women's rights and equality during and after a revolution.
 Choice b) Women typically assume leadership roles during times of revolution.  This statement is not supported by the passage,  as it does not mention anything about women assuming leadership roles.
 Choice c) Women rarely support revolutions and therefore receive little benefit from them.  This statement is not supported by the passage,  as it does not mention anything about women's support for revolutions.
 Choice d) Revolutionary movements are generally uninterested in women's rights.  This statement is supported by the passage,  as it highlights the need for women's rights to be addressed during and after a revolution.

 ""The question as to who,  and what,  is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels.  Firstly,  the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent.  Secondly,  one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system.  The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa. ""

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the historical context of the period 1450  to 1750  C. E.,  which is the time when European traders were actively establishing trade contacts with African societies.
 Next,  I need to analyze the information provided by Walter Rodney,  who discusses the impact of the imperialist system on African development.  He mentions that the capitalists of Western Europe actively extended their exploitation to cover the whole of Africa.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the given choices and see which one aligns with the information provided by Rodney.  Choice a) focuses on the importation of New World foodstuffs,  which is not mentioned in the text.  Choice c) mentions slaves,  which is not directly related to the text's focus on the imperialist system.  Choice d) discusses the removal of Muslim and Arab merchant princes,  which is not mentioned in the text.
 Choice b) states that Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with Europeans for firearms.  This choice aligns with the text's mention of the imperialist system's impact on African economic retardation and the manipulation of the system by capitalists of Western Europe.

 In fact,  the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this,  that the deed was done by a subject race â€” by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters,  and that of poor helpless ladies and children.  Here we had not only a servile war,  but we had a war of religion,  a war of race,  and a war of revenge,  of hope,  of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger,  and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs,  and the full sway of native religions.  Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt,  it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders,  as if by common instinct,  determined to effect their end was,  the destruction of every white man,  woman or child who fell into their hands.
 British journalist William Howard Russell,  My Indian Mutlny Diary,  1860
 Violence,  it must be emphasized,  was an essential component of the British presence in India.  A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it.  The right to violence is,  therefore,  everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly.  British rule in India,  as an autocracy,  had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence.  The revolt of 1857  shattered that monopoly by matching an official,  alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized.  The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin.  This was the condition of their domination,  of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races,  as civilized and uncivilized.  And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.

 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key information from the second passage.  The passage states that British rule in India was an autocracy with a meticulously constructed monopoly of violence.  The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official,  alien violence with an indigenous violence of the colonized.  The passage also mentions that the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin,  and this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.

Next,  I need to consider the choices given and see which one aligns with the information from the second passage.  Choice a) is not supported by the passage,  as it does not mention any justification for the massacre based on local military custom.  Choice c) is not supported either,  as the passage does not praise the massacre as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.  Choice d) is also not supported,  as the passage does not mention any conspiracy behind the massacre.

The passage does,  however,  support choice b) by stating that the Cawnpore Massacre can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.  This choice aligns with the information that the British had a monopoly of violence and were treated as superior races,  which led to the colonized reacting with violence against them.

 You say you would prefer moderate labour and lower wages; are you pretty comfortable upon your present wages?
 â€”I have no wages,  but two days a week at present; but when I am working at some jobs we can make a little,  and at others we do very poorly.
 When a child gets 3 s.  a week,  does that go much towards its subsistence?
 â€”No,  it will not keep it as it should do.
 Why do you allow your children to go to work at those places where they are ill-treated or over-worked?
 â€”Necessity compels a man that has children to let them work.
 Then you would not allow your children to go to those factories under the present system,  if it was not from necessity?
 â€”No.

 According to the passage,  why does the witness allow his children to work in a place where they will be ill-treated?  Choices: a) A factory owner is forcing him to do so.  b) He doesnâ€™t earn enough on his own.  c) The children need discipline.  d) Their labor is only moderately difficult.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the relevant information in the passage.  The question is asking why the witness allows his children to work in a place where they are ill-treated or over-worked.
 The witness explicitly states that ""necessity compels a man that has children to let them work.""  This indicates that the reason for allowing his children to work in such conditions is due to the necessity of providing for them.
 The passage does not mention any factory owner forcing him to do so,  so option a) is incorrect.  The witness does not mention his own inability to earn enough as the reason,  so option b) is incorrect.  There is no mention of the children needing discipline,  so option c) is incorrect.  The witness prefers moderate labour and lower wages,  so option d) is incorrect.

Choices: a) Issue a casus belli to go to war with the Kingdom of Zulu b) Tax the Zulu kingdom to cover damages attributed to them c) Sever its responsibility to protect citizens who chose to live in South Africa d) Liberate the Zulus from British colonialism 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the letter.  It is a letter from a British citizen during the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879,  where the British were fighting against the Zulu kingdom.
 Next,  I need to consider the incidents described in the letter.  The author mentions that his property was insured,  but the insurance company will not cover the damage done by the Queen's enemies,  which implies the Zulu forces.  He also mentions that his crops and premises were partly destroyed by a contingent of 1,500 Zulu natives.
 Now,  I need to consider the choices given and see which one fits the context.  a) Issuing a casus belli to go to war with the Kingdom of Zulu is a possibility,  as the incidents could be used as a reason to justify going to war.  b) Taxing the Zulu kingdom to cover damages attributed to them is not likely,  as the Zulu kingdom was not a British colony,  so they would not be responsible for paying taxes to the British government.  c) Severing its responsibility to protect citizens who chose to live in South Africa is also not likely,  as the British government would not want to give up responsibility for its citizens.  d) Liberating the Zulus from British colonialism is not relevant,  as the Zulu kingdom was not a British colony.

 Kwame Nkrumah,  Ghanian leader,  1961
 Nkrumah's argument in the passage most clearly supports which of the following ideologies?  Choices: a) Pan-Africanism b) Communism c) African socialism d) Neocolonialism 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the main ideas in the passage.  Nkrumah argues that Africa should avoid dangers of disunity and create a political union to project its personality and gain respect from the world.  He also criticizes the lack of attention to African independence by the Great Powers.
 Next,  I need to match these ideas to the given ideologies.  Pan-Africanism is the belief that people of African descent should unite for mutual support and development.  Communism is a political and economic system that advocates for the communal ownership of property and the means of production.  African socialism is a political ideology that emphasizes the importance of self-reliance,  social justice,  and the development of a strong African identity.  Neocolonialism is a form of economic and political control by developed countries over developing countries,  often through multinational corporations and international organizations.

"Input: This question refers to the following information.
 ""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years,  with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants.  On the other hand,  many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production,  with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land.  If this tendency goes unchecked,  the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day.  Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties.  Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us,  for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road.  Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances?  Obviously not!  There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis.  And that means to bring about,  step by step,  the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words,  it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.  We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. ""
 Mao Zedong,  On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation,  1955
 Which of the following best explains Mao's concept of the ""socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture"" in China?  Choices: a) Agriculture fueled industrialization in cities as excess labor flowed from the countryside to urban centers.  b) Agricultural surpluses allowed the state to invest more heavily in modernizing agricultural production.  c) Agricultural efficiency reduced prices of basic commodities,  raising the standard of living across the whole of China.  d) Agriculture was collectivized,  with the result that entire communities shared fields instead of individuals owning the land as private property.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand Mao's concept of the ""socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture.""  Mao argues that this involves eliminating the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside,  with the goal of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and improving the well-being of all rural people.

Choice a) discusses the flow of labor from the countryside to urban centers,  which is not directly related to Mao's concept of socialist transformation.  Choice b) mentions state investment in modernizing agricultural production,  which is also not directly related to Mao's concept.  Choice c) talks about reducing prices of basic commodities and improving the standard of living,  which is a potential outcome of the socialist transformation but not the transformation itself.
 Choice d) states that agriculture was collectivized,  with communities sharing fields instead of individuals owning the land as private property.  This directly aligns with Mao's concept of eliminating the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside.

 ""Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
 And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
 On our first tour,  the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
 When we came back,  our hair was white,  but still there's more unrest.
 The frontier garrisons run with blood,  enough to fill an ocean,
 But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
 In the hundred districts east of the mountains,  throughout the land of Han,
 There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
 Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
 The crops grow every which way,  the fields are all a mess.

 They're rounded up like dogs or chickens,  every male impressed.
 ""But sir,  though it's good of you to ask,
 Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
 We can only shake our heads.  Take this winter:

 But where will it come from?  You can't get blood from a stone!

 And live with the neighbors next door.

Choices: a) Adroit diplomacy and establishment of client relationships with bordering nomads b) The ability of the Tang emperor to project military power on the frontier in order to impose his will c) The permanent settlement of Han Chinese in frontier zones d) The payment of tribute to nomadic rulers 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze the poem and identify the key themes and historical context.  The poem describes the life of soldiers in the Tang dynasty,  their experiences,  and the difficulties they face.  The soldiers have been repeatedly called to serve in frontier garrisons,  and the poem mentions the unrest and bloodshed associated with these military campaigns.

Next,  I need to consider the Tang dynasty's relations with western nomadic peoples and frontier peoples.  The poem mentions the emperor's territorial ambitions and the continuous military presence in the frontier regions.  It also highlights the hardship faced by the soldiers and the impact on the civilian population,  such as the inability to pay taxes due to the constant call-up of men for military service.

Finally,  I need to evaluate the choices based on the historical context and the themes presented in the poem.  a) Adroit diplomacy and establishment of client relationships with bordering nomads is not supported by the poem,  as it focuses on the internal issues within the Tang dynasty rather than diplomatic relations with nomadic tribes. b) The ability of the Tang emperor to project military power on the frontier in order to impose his will is consistent with the poem,  as it describes the emperor's territorial ambitions and the continuous military presence in the frontier regions. c) The permanent settlement of Han Chinese in frontier zones is not emphasized in the poem,  as it focuses on the military campaigns and the hardship faced by the soldiers and civilians. d) The payment of tribute to nomadic rulers is not mentioned in the poem,  and it does not address the Tang dynasty's relations with nomadic rulers.

 Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept.  He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive.  He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea,  or were already there.  The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa,  600  miles away.  His problem,  therefore,  was to compose a surrender arrangement which,  while acceptable to the Russians,  would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea.  If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea,  the United States would be unable to stop them.  .  .  .

Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue.  It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored.  My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking.  But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension. "" I have earnestly opposed violent tension,  but there is a type of constructive,  nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth.  Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal,  we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.

 In fact,  the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this,  that the deed was done by a subject race â€” by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters,  and that of poor helpless ladies and children.  Here we had not only a servile war,  but we had a war of religion,  a war of race,  and a war of revenge,  of hope,  of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger,  and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs,  and the full sway of native religions.  Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt,  it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders,  as if by common instinct,  determined to effect their end was,  the destruction of every white man,  woman or child who fell into their hands.
 British journalist William Howard Russell,  My Indian Mutlny Diary,  1860
 Violence,  it must be emphasized,  was an essential component of the British presence in India.  A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it.  The right to violence is,  therefore,  everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly.  British rule in India,  as an autocracy,  had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence.  The revolt of 1857  shattered that monopoly by matching an official,  alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized.  The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin.  This was the condition of their domination,  of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races,  as civilized and uncivilized.  And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.

Choices: a) That they obediently fulfill their obligations within the home b) That they collaborate with their husbands on domestic tasks c) That they pursue education in order to find meaningful employment d) That they speak their minds boldly 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the expectations for women in ancient China mentioned in the passage.  The passage states that a woman is industrious if she follows rules such as rising early, performing domestic duties, and finishing tasks completely.  It also states that a woman continues ancestral worship if she is correct in manner, upright in character, and attending to her own affairs.  Finally,  it mentions that a woman who observes these three fundamentals of life has never had a bad reputation.

Based on these statements,  the expectation for women in ancient China,  according to the passage,  is that they obediently fulfill their obligations within the home.  This expectation is expressed in the requirement for women to perform domestic duties,  be correct in manner and upright in character,  and attend to their own affairs.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

 The following poem refers to an incident in Sharpeville,  South Africa,  in 1960.  To protest the requirement that they carry papers documenting their identity and residence,  black South Africans gathered in front of police stations without their papers.  Though other protests ended peacefully,  in Sharpeville,  police fired into the crowd.
 What is important
 about Sharpeville
 is not that seventy died:
 nor even that they were shot in the back
 retreating,  unarmed,  defenceless
 and certainty not
 the heavy caliber slug
 that tore through a mother's back
 and ripped through the child in her arms
 killing it
 Remember Sharpeville
 bullet-in-the-back day
 Because it epitomized oppression
 and the nature of society
 More clearly than anything else;
 it was the classic event
 Nowhere is racial dominance
 more clearly defined
 nowhere the will to oppress
 more clearly demonstrated
 What the world whispers
 apartheid declares with snarling guns
 the blood the rich lust after
 South Africa spills dust
 Remember Sharpeville
 Remember bullet-in-the-back day
 And remember the unquenchable will for freedom
 Remember the dead
 and be glad
 â€”Dennis Brutus,  1973

 While some theorists in the Middle Ages argued that the jihad was a defensive warâ€¦ most authorities held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam.  The Bahr [al-Fava'id,  or ""Sea of Precious Virtues, "" written in the 1150 s or 1160 s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam,  and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel,  that ruler would be better dead than alive,  for he would be corrupting the world.

 It is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon,  when they see any Muslim hermits,  bring them food and treat them kindly,  saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them.  Likewise,  not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories.

 Let the deeds of your ancestors move you and incite your minds to manly achievements; the glory and greatness of king Charles the Great,  and of his son Louis,  and of your other kings,  who have destroyed the kingdoms of the pagans,  and extended in these lands the territory of the holy church.  Let the holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior,  which is possessed by unclean nations,  especially incite you,  and the holy places which are now treated with ignominy and irreverently polluted with their filthiness.

 In fact,  the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this,  that the deed was done by a subject race â€” by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters,  and that of poor helpless ladies and children.  Here we had not only a servile war,  but we had a war of religion,  a war of race,  and a war of revenge,  of hope,  of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger,  and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs,  and the full sway of native religions.  Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt,  it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders,  as if by common instinct,  determined to effect their end was,  the destruction of every white man,  woman or child who fell into their hands.
 British journalist William Howard Russell,  My Indian Mutlny Diary,  1860
 Violence,  it must be emphasized,  was an essential component of the British presence in India.  A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it.  The right to violence is,  therefore,  everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly.  British rule in India,  as an autocracy,  had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence.  The revolt of 1857  shattered that monopoly by matching an official,  alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized.  The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin.  This was the condition of their domination,  of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races,  as civilized and uncivilized.  And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.

Banditry due to socio-economic breakdown refers to violence caused by economic hardship,  which is not the main cause of the Indian Mutiny.  Killing of civilians during wartime refers to violence in the context of a war,  which is relevant to the Indian Mutiny.  Collateral damage caused by weapons of mass destruction refers to unintentional harm caused by such weapons,  which is not applicable to the Indian Mutiny.

 ""The Romanists have,  with great adroitness,  drawn three walls round themselves,  with which they have hitherto protected themselves,  so that no one could reform them,  whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.
 Firstly,  if pressed by the temporal power,  they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them,  but,  on the contrary,  that the spiritual power is above the temporal.
 Secondly,  if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures,  they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.
 Thirdly,  if they are threatened with a council,  they pretend that no one may call a council but the Popeâ€¦
 â€¦The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they alone pretend to be considered masters of the Scriptures; although they learn nothing of them all their life.  They assume authority,  and juggle before us with impudent words,  saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith,  whether he be evil or good,  albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter.  That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian,  nay unnatural,  laws; but of these we need not speak now.  For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them,  however unlearned and wicked they may be,  they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like.

 Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000  pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians.  Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000  or 4,000  Indians working in the mercury mine,  with picks and hammers,  breaking up the ore.  And when they have filled up their little sacks,  the poor fellows,  loaded down,  climb up those ladders and rigging,  so distressing that a man can hardly get up them.  That is the way they work in this mine,  with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion.  Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents.  According to His Majesty's warrant,  the mine owners at PotosÃ­ have a right to the mita of 13,300  Indians.  These mita Indians earn each day 4  reals.  Besides these there are others not under obligation,  who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12  to 16  reals,  and some up to 24,  according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.

 The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control,  they have been forced to pay yasak tribute.

 Joseph Stalin,  speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry,  February 4,  1931
 The speech as a whole is best understood in the context of which of the following historical developments?  Choices: a) Stalin's drive to motivate Soviet industry for the Winter War with Finland b) Stalin's push to make the Soviet Union a nuclear nation c) Stalin's implementation of five-year plans for the Soviet economy d) Stalin's purges of dissidents and other political prisoners 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the main theme of the speech.  The speech emphasizes the importance of not falling behind and not being weak,  as those who are backward and weak are beaten.  It also mentions the historical context of Russia being beaten due to its backwardness.
 Next,  I need to consider the historical developments listed as choices and see which one aligns with the main theme of the speech.  The speech is about improving the industrial, military, cultural, political, industrial, and agricultural aspects of the Soviet Union to avoid being beaten by other nations.
 Finally,  I need to determine which historical development best fits the context of the speech.  The speech was delivered in February 1931,  which is before the Winter War with Finland (1939-1940),  the development of the Soviet nuclear program,  and the purges of dissidents.  The speech's focus on improving various aspects of the Soviet Union aligns with Stalin's implementation of five-year plans for the Soviet economy.

 ""The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries.  It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.
 Non-alignment,  as practiced by Ghana and many other countries,  is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist,  socialist or have a mixed economy.  Such a policy,  therefore,  involves foreign investment from capitalist countries,  but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind.  The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investmentsâ€¦The question is one of power.  A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny. ""
 Kwame Nkrumah,  Neo-Colonialism,  1965
 Which of the following most inspired the national plan advanced by Nkrumah in the second paragraph?  Choices: a) Fascism b) Social Darwinism c) Classical liberalism d) Socialism 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key elements of the national plan advanced by Nkrumah in the second paragraph.  He mentions that such a policy involves foreign investment from capitalist countries,  but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind.  The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments,  but the question is one of power.
 Next,  I need to consider which of the given choices is most closely related to these elements.  Fascism is a form of far-right,  authoritarian ultranationalism,  which is not related to the national plan described by Nkrumah.  Social Darwinism is a theory that the principles of natural selection and survival of the fittest can be applied to human societies,  which is also not related to the national plan.  Classical liberalism emphasizes individual liberty,  limited government,  and free markets,  which does not align with the national plan.
 Finally,  I consider socialism,  which advocates for social ownership and operation of the means of production,  as well as the political theories and movements associated with it.  This choice is most closely related to the national plan,  as it emphasizes control over the means of production and the interests of the state.

 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze the content of Source 2,  which is Winston Churchill's speech before Parliament in June 1940.  The speech is characterized by a strong determination to fight against the Axis powers,  particularly Nazi Germany,  and a commitment to defend the United Kingdom against any invasion.
 Next,  I need to consider the context of the speech.  In June 1940,  the United Kingdom was facing the threat of a German invasion,  and the country was preparing for a possible war against Germany.  Churchill's speech was a response to these threats and aimed to inspire the British people and Parliament to stand firm against the Axis powers.
 Finally,  I need to compare the content of the speech to the given choices.  The speech does not mention support for resistance movements,  trade deals with American manufacturers,  or fears about a possible invasion attempt by Nazi Germany.  However,  it clearly reflects the British government's stance on appeasing the Axis powers,  as it rejects the idea of avoiding conflict and instead calls for a strong defense against the Axis powers.

 ""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years,  with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants.  On the other hand,  many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production,  with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land.  If this tendency goes unchecked,  the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day.  Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties.  Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us,  for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road.  Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances?  Obviously not!  There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis.  And that means to bring about,  step by step,  the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words,  it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the second-to-last line of the passage,  which is ""We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.""
 The question asks which of the following later developments would most undermine the hopes expressed by Mao in this line.
 Mao is suggesting that the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance is through the socialist transformation of agriculture,  handicrafts,  and capitalist industry and commerce.
 Now,  I need to evaluate each choice and see which one undermines this goal.
 a) The development of Special Economic Zones along the Chinese coast brought economic growth to China.  This choice could potentially support the goal of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance by promoting economic growth,  so it does not undermine the hopes expressed by Mao.
 b) Political friction with the Soviet Union pushed China into the orbit of the United States during the Cold War.  This choice could be seen as a political issue,  but it does not directly undermine the goal of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance through the socialist transformation of the economy,  so it is not the most undermining choice.
 c) The cooperatives of peasants on the farmland and an emphasis on countryside steel production brought famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry.  This choice directly undermines the goal of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance by showing that the socialist transformation efforts led to famine and poverty,  which is the most undermining choice.
 d) Opposition voices in the Communist Party led by men such as Deng Xiaopeng were rooted out and silenced during the Cultural Revolution.  This choice could be seen as a political issue,  but it does not directly undermine the goal of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance through the socialist transformation of the economy,  so it is not the most undermining choice.

 By what principle of reason then,  should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug?  Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts,  we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain,  they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us!  And such being the case,  we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men?  We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity.  This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind.  Since you do not permit it to injure your own country,  you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country,  and above all others,  how much less to the Inner Land!

 Which of the following most likely prompted the complaint voiced in the passage?  Choices: a) British sale of opium in China b) British exports of tobacco to China c) British introduction of gunpowder to China d) British encouragement of heroin use to China 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the main complaint in the passage.  The passage mentions that foreigners are sending a poisonous drug to China,  and that this is done out of an inordinate thirst for gain.  The passage also mentions that opium is prohibited in the British homeland,  which suggests that the complaint is related to the sale of opium in China.
 Next,  I need to consider the other choices.  British exports of tobacco to China are not mentioned in the passage,  so this is not the complaint.  The passage does not discuss the introduction of gunpowder,  so this is not the complaint either.  The passage does not mention heroin,  so this is not the complaint.

 Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs.  China
 In Western Europe during the 1200 s through the 1400 s,  early cannons,  as heavy and as slow to fire as they were,  proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move.  By contrast,  China,  especially after the mid-1300 s,  was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads,  against whom early gunpowder weapons,  with their unwieldiness,  proved of little utility.  It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
 According to this passage,  why did the Chinese,  despite inventing gunpowder,  fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry?  Choices: a) They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.  b) They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.  c) They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.  d) They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key information in the passage.  The passage states that in Western Europe,  gunpowder weapons were developed because they were useful in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during that period.  In contrast,  China was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads,  against whom early gunpowder weapons proved of little utility.  China therefore devoted its efforts to improving horse archer units.
 Based on this information,  the reason for China's failure to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry is that they logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.

Option b) The government undertook a program of conquest in the Pacific, does not directly address the concerns of Lord Ii.  Option c) The country sent emissaries to study western democracies and industry, aligns with the concerns raised by Lord Ii as it involves adopting new technologies and military strategies from the West.

 At the peak of their power,  the domains of the Mongol khans,  or rulers,  made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated.  .  .  .  The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction.  The result was an important new stage in international contact.  From eastern Europe to southern China,  merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property.  The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe,  Asia,  and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere.  The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food,  inventions,  and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries.  Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy,  cosmopolitan cities.  They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions .  .  .  a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.

Choices: a) Russia was excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance).  b) Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity.  c) Islam became the dominant religion of Russia.  d) Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200 s and its long-term consequences.  The Mongol Empire was known for its tolerance of different religions and its promotion of trade and communication between different regions.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice in the context of the Mongol conquest.  a) Russia was excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance) - This choice does not seem to be a direct consequence of the Mongol conquest, as the Mongols did not actively prevent Russia from interacting with other civilizations.
 b) Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity - This choice is not accurate, as the Mongol Empire was not centered in Russia, but rather in the steppes of Mongolia.
 c) Islam became the dominant religion of Russia - This choice is not supported by historical evidence, as the Mongol conquest did not lead to a significant spread of Islam in Russia.
 d) Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy - This choice is consistent with the Mongol influence, as the Mongols were known for their administrative and legal systems that facilitated trade and governance across their vast empire.

 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze the information provided.  The Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 (Australia) and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (United States) are both laws that restrict immigration and penalize certain immigrants.  The Australian law focuses on European immigrants and manual laborers, while the Chinese Exclusion Act specifically targets Chinese laborers.

Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  a) The rise of anti-Semitic ideologies does not fit the context of these laws, as they do not specifically target Jewish immigrants.  b) Trade protectionism is an economic policy that aims to protect domestic industries by imposing tariffs or other restrictions on imports, which is not the main focus of these laws.  c) A growing desire to attract skilled labor from abroad is the opposite of what these laws aim to achieve.

 Next,  I need to consider the relationship between Persia and Arabia during this time.  Arabia was a region that was home to various tribes and states,  including the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates.
 To determine the best description of their relationship,  I need to consider the key events and interactions between Persia and Arabia during this period.  One significant event was the Arab conquest of Persia in the early 7th century,  which led to the establishment of the Umayyad and later Abbasid caliphates.

 Senegalese poet LÃ©opold SÃ©dar Senghor,  ""To New York, "" 1956
 Which of the following best explains the phenomenon of an African poet writing so lyrically about New York?  Choices: a) Outmigration from Africa due to political violence b) Stronger transatlantic influences linking art in Afro-Eurasia with that in the Americas c) Preference on the part of African intellectuals for Western cultural advancements d) Lack of a rich indigenous artistic tradition in Africa 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the historical and cultural context of the time when LÃ©opold SÃ©dar Senghor wrote ""To New York.""  Senghor was a Senegalese poet and political leader who lived from 1906 to 1988.  During his lifetime,  Africa was experiencing political upheaval and colonization by European powers.  This suggests that option a) Outmigration from Africa due to political violence is not the primary reason for an African poet writing about New York.
 Next,  I consider the transatlantic influences on art and culture.  During the 20th century,  there was a significant exchange of ideas,  art,  and culture between Africa,  the Americas,  and Europe.  This exchange was facilitated by the transatlantic slave trade,  as well as later by migration,  travel,  and communication technologies.  This suggests that option b) Stronger transatlantic influences linking art in Afro-Eurasia with that in the Americas is a plausible explanation for an African poet writing about New York.
 Then,  I consider the preference of African intellectuals for Western cultural advancements.  While some African intellectuals may have admired Western cultural advancements,  this does not necessarily explain why an African poet would write lyrically about New York specifically.  This suggests that option c) Preference on the part of African intellectuals for Western cultural advancements is not the primary reason.
 Finally,  I consider the lack of a rich indigenous artistic tradition in Africa.  Africa has a rich and diverse indigenous artistic tradition,  with many cultures having their own unique forms of art and expression.  This suggests that option d) Lack of a rich indigenous artistic tradition in Africa is not a valid explanation for an African poet writing about New York.

Based on the analysis,  the best explanation for the phenomenon of an African poet writing so lyrically about New York is b) Stronger transatlantic influences linking art in Afro-Eurasia with that in the Americas.

 First,  I need to identify the key elements of the speech that would help me determine the context.  The speech mentions Jerusalem,  Constantinople,  the kingdom of the Persians,  the Greek kingdom,  and the holy sepulchre of the Lord our Savior.  It also discusses the invasion of Christian lands by a pagan race,  the destruction of churches,  and the desire to reclaim territory and the holy sepulchre.
 Next,  I need to consider the historical events that match these descriptions.  The Mongol invasions of the Middle East focused on Asian territories and did not involve Jerusalem or Constantinople.  The Protestant Reformation began in the 16th century and was centered on the reform of the Catholic Church, not the invasion of Christian lands.  The Age of Discovery was about the exploration and colonization of the Americas and other uncharted territories, not the conflict with a pagan race in Europe.
 The only option that matches the descriptions in the speech is the Crusades,  which were a series of religious wars between Christians and Muslims for control of Jerusalem and other holy sites.  The Crusades began in the late 11th century,  which aligns with the time period mentioned in the speech.

"Input: This question refers to the following information.
 I have,  in conformity without resolve,  put together some few points concerning the reformation of the Christian estate,  with the intent of placing the same before the Christian nobility of the German nation.  .  .  .  It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I,  an individual poor man,  have taken upon me to address your lordships.  The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates,  more especially in Germany,  have led not only myself,  but every one else,  to cry aloud and to ask for help.  .  .  .  These Romanists have,  with great adroitness,  drawn three walls around themselves,  with which they have hitherto protected themselves,  so that no one could reform them,  whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.  .  .  .  That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality .  .  .  That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope .  .  .  That No One May Call a Council but the Pope.  .  .  .  Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils,  and with which popes,  cardinals,  bishops,  and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night.  .  .  .  It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom,  who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St.  Peter,  lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal.  What is the use in Christendom of the people called ""cardinals""?  I will tell you.  In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents,  endowments,  fiefs,  and benefices,  and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome,  they created cardinals,  and gave them the sees,  convents,  and prelacies,  and thus destroyed the service of God.
 â€”Martin Luther,  Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation
 Which of the following reformers expressed views similar to those expressed by Martin Luther in his letter above?  Choices: a) Ulrich Zwingli b) Sir Thomas More c) Erasmus d) John Wycliffe 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key points of Martin Luther's views in the letter.  He is calling for the reformation of the Christian estate,  criticizing the Roman Catholic Church for its adherence to certain practices,  such as the Pope's authority to interpret the Scriptures and call councils.  He also criticizes the lavish lifestyle of the Pope and the role of cardinals in acquiring wealth for the Church.
 Next,  I need to compare these views to the known reformers in the choices provided.  Ulrich Zwingli was a Swiss reformer who advocated for the removal of images and the rejection of transubstantiation.  Sir Thomas More was a 16th-century English statesman who opposed the English Reformation.  Erasmus was a Dutch humanist who criticized the Church but did not advocate for a complete break from it.  John Wycliffe was an English theologian who argued for the separation of the Church's temporal and spiritual powers.
 Comparing these views,  I can see that Martin Luther's views are most similar to those of John Wycliffe,  who also advocated for the separation of the Church's temporal and spiritual powers.

 ""When the Portuguese go from Macao in China to Japan,  they carry much white silk,  gold,  musk,  and porcelain: and they bring from Japan nothing but silver.  They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan,  and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India,  they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold,  musk,  silk,  copper,  porcelains,  and many other things very costly and gilded.
 When the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic,  they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city,  they must enter their names in a book,  and when they go out at night they must put out their names.  They may not lie in the town all night,  but must lie in their boats outside of the town.  And,  their time expired,  if any man remains there,  he is imprisoned. ""

 The description in the second paragraph of the procedures that Portuguese and other foreigners followed when trading in China supports which of the following inferences about trade policy in the later Ming Dynasty?  Choices: a) The Ming Dynasty was very supportive of and welcoming to all commercial enterprise.  b) The Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly to limit contact with foreigners and ease collection of taxes.  c) The Ming Dynasty was too busy battling pirates along its coast to pay any attention to regular merchant activity.  d) The Ming Dynasty only allowed Portugal to trade with China through Canton,  permitting only one boat a year.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key points in the second paragraph that describe the procedures followed by the Portuguese and other foreigners when trading in China.  These include entering their names in a book upon entering the city,  putting out their names when leaving at night,  and being restricted to a certain amount of time before being required to leave.
 Next,  I need to consider the trade policy in the later Ming Dynasty based on these procedures.  The fact that the Portuguese and other foreigners had to follow these specific rules suggests that the Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly.
 Finally,  I need to match the trade policy with one of the given choices.  The choice that best matches the trade policy based on the procedures described is b) The Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly to limit contact with foreigners and ease collection of taxes.

 By what principle of reason then,  should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug?  Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts,  we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain,  they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us!  And such being the case,  we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men?  We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity.  This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind.  Since you do not permit it to injure your own country,  you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country,  and above all others,  how much less to the Inner Land!  Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries,  there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.

 On which of the following arguments does the author of the passage principally base his appeal?  Choices: a) It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own.  b) Confucian teachings forbid the use of all narcotics as inherently immoral.  c) Addiction is causing China to suffer an unfavorable balance of trade.  d) Britain is unwise to risk the wrath of a militarily more powerful state.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the main argument of the passage.  The author is discussing the sale of opium from China to foreign countries,  particularly Britain.  He is criticizing this practice and arguing against it.
 Next,  I need to look for the specific point that the author is making against the sale of opium.  The author states that ""since you do not permit it to injure your own country,  you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country,  and above all others,  how much less to the Inner Land!""
 This statement suggests that the author is arguing against the sale of opium on the basis of hypocrisy.  He is saying that it is hypocritical for Britain to sell a substance that is banned in their own country to China.

 ""In Northern India the existence of separate States at this period is usually little more than a question of words.  A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence,  and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty,  the first step was to refuse,  or omit to pay revenue.  Such an omission might,  however,  arise from various other causes,  and it is probable that in Rajputana,  Central India,  and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position,  sometimes paying the stipulated revenue,  sometimes in open rebellion,  and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion. ""
 W. H.  Moreland,  India at the Death of Akbar,  1920
 Zamindars had an ability ""to establish a claim to sovereignty"" largely due to the Mughal Empire's policy of Choices: a) religious toleration b) universal taxation c) martial law d) suffrage 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the question.  Zamindars were landowners in the Mughal Empire who collected land taxes and provided military support.  They could establish a claim to sovereignty by refusing to pay revenue to the Mughal Empire.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given and their relevance to the ability of zamindars to establish a claim to sovereignty.  Religious toleration,  martial law,  and suffrage are not directly related to the ability of zamindars to refuse to pay revenue.
 The choice that is most relevant to the ability of zamindars to refuse to pay revenue is ""universal taxation.""  If the Mughal Empire practiced universal taxation,  it would be difficult to refuse or omit to pay revenue without risking open rebellion or practical independence.

 But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness.  Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and,  as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports,  the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight.  .  .  .  The victorious legions,  who,  in distant wars,  acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries,  first oppressed the freedom of the republic,  and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple.  The emperors,  anxious for their personal safety and the public peace,  were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military .  .  .  was relaxed .  .  .  ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.

 Martin Luther,  Address to the Nobility of the German Nation,  1520
 How is the ""temporal power"" mentioned in the passage best understood contextually?  Choices: a) A clerical or ecclesiastical authority b) A legal or scholarly authority c) A state or secular authority d) A business or economic authority 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the passage.  It is a speech by Martin Luther addressing the nobility of the German Nation in 1520.  The passage is criticizing the Romanists (the Roman Catholic Church) for their resistance to reform.
 Next,  I need to identify the specific mention of the ""temporal power"" in the passage.  It occurs in the first sentence: ""The Romanists have,  with great adroitness,  drawn three walls round themselves,  with which they have hitherto protected themselves,  so that no one could reform them,  whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly.  Firstly,  if pressed by the temporal power,  they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them,  but,  on the contrary,  that the spiritual power is above the temporal.""
 Finally,  I need to determine which of the given choices best fits the contextual meaning of ""temporal power"" in this sentence.  The passage contrasts the ""temporal power"" with the ""spiritual power,"" which refers to the authority of the Roman Catholic Church.  The ""temporal power"" is the authority that the Roman Catholic Church claims is not its own and therefore not subject to its jurisdiction.
 Therefore,  the ""temporal power"" mentioned in the passage best fits the context of choice c) A state or secular authority.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the historical context of the period.  Late Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union were periods of significant social and political change,  with the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 marking the beginning of the Soviet era.
 Next,  I need to analyze the literacy rates over time.  The literacy rate increased significantly from 1897 to 1955,  with the largest jumps occurring during the Soviet period.
 Now,  I need to consider the different segments of the population and their likelihood of benefiting from the rising literacy rates.  The urban middle class and the armed forces officers would likely have had better access to education and resources,  but the Soviet government prioritized expanding education to the rural population as part of its policy to modernize and industrialize the country.

Choices: a) Many Muslims inclined toward atheism in the premodern era.  b) Religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims.  c) Christian missionaries were steadily winning converts among Muslim populations.  d) Muslim intellectuals were generally hostile to traditional religious practice.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze the content of both verses.  The first verse is from the Qur'an,  which is a religious text for Muslims,  and it warns against certain activities that it considers sinful or unholy.  The second verse is from the RubÃ¡iyÃ¡t of Omar KhayyÃ¡m,  a poem written by a Muslim poet in the 11th century.  The poem suggests enjoying wine at a specific time.
 Next,  I need to consider the historical context.  The Qur'an was revealed in the 7th century,  while the RubÃ¡iyÃ¡t was written in the 11th century,  so there is a significant time gap between the two texts.  During this time,  the Islamic world was diverse,  with different interpretations and practices among Muslims.
 Finally,  I need to evaluate the possible conclusions based on the analysis and context.  The first verse warns against certain activities,  while the second verse suggests enjoying wine.  This comparison would best support the conclusion that religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

 How would twentieth-century economist John Maynard Keynes suggest that society address Otto von Bismarck's evaluation of workers in Germany?  Choices: a) Keynes would recommend government intervention in order to maintain aggregate demand.  b) Keynes would suggest helping elderly workers,  but claim that the government should not intervene in most circumstances.  c) Keynes would caution against government intervention in personal economic matters.  d) Keynes would advocate doing nothing because he felt poverty in rural areas was actually more severe than it was in cities.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the main issue Otto von Bismarck is addressing: the insecurity of workers due to lack of support in case of illness, old age, or poverty.
 Next,  I need to consider John Maynard Keynes' economic views.  Keynes believed that government intervention was necessary to maintain aggregate demand and stabilize the economy during times of economic downturn.
 Now,  I need to determine how Keynes' views would apply to the issue of worker insecurity.  Keynes would likely argue that the government should intervene to provide support for workers in case of illness, old age, or poverty, in order to maintain aggregate demand and prevent economic downturns.

 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze the information provided in both texts.  The Epic of Gilgamesh describes the House of Darkness as a place of darkness,  dirt,  and clay,  where those who dwell do not come out.  This suggests a gloomy view of the afterlife.
 The Maxims of Ptahhotep discusses the importance of truth and rightdoing,  and the consequences of wrongdoing.  It mentions that those who follow the path of truth are guided by the gods and cannot lose themselves,  while those who are forbidden passage by the gods will not be able to cross the river of life.  This suggests a more optimistic view of the afterlife,  as those who follow the path of truth are rewarded.
 Comparing the two texts,  I can see that the Epic of Gilgamesh presents a gloomier view of the afterlife,  while the Maxims of Ptahhotep presents a more optimistic view.

 The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
 The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
 But where will it come from?  You can't get blood from a stone!
 I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
 It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
 And live with the neighbors next door.
 But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie. ""

 Which of the following does the poem provide direct evidence for in its discussion of taxation in the third stanza?  Choices: a) The Tang Dynasty's strong bureaucracy at the local level b) The Tang Dynasty's large,  standing professional army with no need of conscription c) Relatively advanced Tang agricultural technologies d) The relatively high level of urbanization in Tang China 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the third stanza of the poem.  The third stanza is: ""The District Officers are demanding the land tax,  But where will it come from?  You can't get blood from a stone!""
 This stanza directly discusses the issue of taxation,  specifically the land tax.  The speaker is questioning where the tax money will come from,  suggesting that the farmers are unable to pay due to the poor conditions of their land.
 The stanza provides direct evidence for the Tang Dynasty's taxation policies,  but it does not directly address any of the given choices.  However,  the mention of the land tax and the difficulty of farmers paying it implies that the Tang Dynasty's strong bureaucracy at the local level (choice a) is relevant,  as the District Officers are responsible for collecting the tax.

 But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness.  Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and,  as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports,  the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight.  .  .  .  The victorious legions,  who,  in distant wars,  acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries,  first oppressed the freedom of the republic,  and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple.  The emperors,  anxious for their personal safety and the public peace,  were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military .  .  .  was relaxed .  .  .  ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.
 â€”Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,  by Edward Gibbon
 The reasons given in the above passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to which other classical empires?  Choices: a) Tang and Ottoman b) Ming and Aztec c) Han and Gupta d) Qin and Etruscan 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the reasons for the fall of the Roman Empire given in the passage.  These include:
 1. Immoderate greatness and the natural decline that comes with it.
 2. Prosperity leading to the ripening of decay and the multiplication of causes of destruction.
 3. The removal of artificial supports,  such as the artificial supports that Rome used to maintain its structure.
 4. The legions becoming acquainted with the vices of strangers and mercenaries,  which led to the oppression of freedom and the violation of the majesty of the purple.
 5. The use of the military to maintain personal safety and public peace,  which led to the relaxation of military discipline.
 6. The invasion of the Roman world by a deluge of Barbarians.

Next,  I need to consider which of the other classical empires could also be affected by these reasons.  The Tang, Ming, Han, and Qin empires were all located in China,  and the Etruscan and Aztec empires were not as closely connected to the issues mentioned in the passage.

Finally,  I need to determine which of the remaining choices have similar historical events that could be attributed to the reasons given for the fall of Rome.  The Han and Gupta empires were both located in China,  and the Tang and Ottoman empires were both located in the Middle East.  The Ottoman Empire was known for its military prowess and expansion,  which could be related to the reasons for the fall of Rome.  The Tang Dynasty,  however,  was not as closely connected to the issues mentioned in the passage.

Enslaved man has multiplied his strength,  [but] having become free,  he has become unjust to his companion.  Oh,  women,  women!  When will you cease to be blind?  What advantage have you received from the Revolution?  A more pronounced scorn,  a more marked disdain.  If our leaders persist,  courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority.  Regardless of what barriers confront you,  it is in your power to free yourselves!

 Halima Ghomri,  interviewed in the 1970 s,  after Algeria's war of independence
 Which of the following factors is likeliest to have prevented the sort of progress hoped for by the speaker in the second passage?  Choices: a) Failure to eradicate Islamic traditionalism b) Lack of industrial assets or infrastructure c) Hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites d) Prioritization of national liberation over social reform 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the context of the second passage.  The speaker,  Halima Ghomri,  is talking about her experience after Algeria's war of independence in the 1970 s.  She mentions that the only positive change is that they are free and work without fear,  but otherwise,  nothing has changed.
 Next,  I need to analyze the choices and see which one is most likely to have prevented the progress she hoped for.  a) Failure to eradicate Islamic traditionalism,  b) Lack of industrial assets or infrastructure,  c) Hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites,  and d) Prioritization of national liberation over social reform.
 Considering the historical context of Algeria,  it is known that the new government faced challenges in addressing social reform and improving the lives of the people.  The war of independence was focused on national liberation,  and once that was achieved,  the new government may have prioritized other issues,  such as social reform,  less.

 ""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years,  with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants.

If this tendency goes unchecked,  the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day.

3.  The immigration into the Commonwealth of the persons described in any of the following paragraphs in this section (hereinafter called ""prohibited immigrants"") is prohibited,  namely
 (a) Any person who when asked to do so by an officer fails to write out at dictation and sign in the presence of the officer a passage of fifty words in length in a European language directed by the officer;
 (b) Any person in the opinion of the Minister or of an officer to become a charge upon the public or upon any public or charitable organisation;
 â€¦
 (g) Any persons under a contract or agreement to perform manual labour within the Commonwealth: Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to workmen exempted by the Minister for special skill required by Australiaâ€¦
 Immigration Restriction Act of 1901  (Australia)
 Whereas in the opinion of the Government of the United States the coming of Chinese laborers to this country endangers the good order of certain localities within the territory thereof;
 Therefore,
 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,  That from and after the expiration of ninety days next after the passage of this act,  the coming of Chinese laborers to the United States be suspended; and during such suspension it shall not be lawful for any Chinese laborer to come,  or having so come after the expiration of said ninety days to remain within the United States.
 SEC.  2.  That the master of every vessel who shall knowingly bring within the United States on such vessel,  and land or permit to be landed,  any Chinese laborer,  from any foreign port or place,  shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,  and on conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars for each and every such Chinese laborer so brought,  and may be also imprisoned for a term not exceeding one yearâ€¦.
 Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882  (United States)
 Which of the following economic activities did the most to drive the rising levels of immigration that led to the enactment of the law described in the second passage?  Choices: a) Railroad construction b) Fertilizer harvesting c) Sugarcane production d) Gold mining 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the time period when the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was enacted.  This act was passed during the 1880s.
 Next,  I need to consider which economic activity was most prevalent during that time period.  Railroad construction was a major industry in the United States during the 19th century,  but it was not the primary driver of immigration during the 1880s.
 Fertilizer harvesting was not a significant economic activity in the United States during the 1880s.
 Sugarcane production was more prominent in the Caribbean and South America,  not the United States.
 Gold mining,  however,  was a major economic activity in the United States during the 19th century,  especially in the western territories.  The California Gold Rush of 1848 attracted thousands of immigrants,  and mining continued to be a significant factor in immigration throughout the 19th century.

 ""The quicksilver mines of Huancavelica are where the poor Indians are so harshly punished,  where they are tortured and so many Indians die; it is there that the noble caciques [headmen] of this kingdom are finished off and tortured.  The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]â€¦. The owners and stewards of the mines,  whether Spaniards,  mestizos,  or Indians,  are such tyrants,  with no fear of God or Justice,  because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a yearâ€¦.
 And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines.  The Indians,  under the pretext of mining chores,  are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains,  and the Indians die.  These Indians are not paid for their labor,  and their work is kept hidden.
 And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubinesâ€¦. And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]â€¦at their own expense,  and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays.  In this way,  the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt,  and they have no way to pay their tribute.
 There is no remedy for all this,  because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners,  and all the owners join forces in bribing himâ€¦. Even the protector of the Indians is useless;â€¦he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians. ""

 First,  I need to identify the key information in the passage.  The passage mentions the Chinese,  Hindus,  Tartars,  and Muslims.  It also describes the presence of Muslims in Chinese provinces,  including in Hangzhou,  where they are exceedingly numerous and well-respected.
 Next,  I need to consider the time period mentioned in the question,  600  C. E. â€“1450  C. E.  This period includes the time of the Chinese dynasties and the rise of the Mongol Empire,  which was led by Genghis Khan.
 Now,  I will evaluate the choices based on the information provided.  Choice a) is not supported by the passage,  as it does not mention stagnation of long-distance contact.  Choice b) is not directly supported,  as the passage does not mention the overturning of prior religious beliefs.  Choice d) is not mentioned in the passage,  as it does not discuss technological developments.
 Choice c) is the most directly supported by the passage,  as it mentions the rise of the Mongol Empire and the presence of Muslims in Chinese provinces.  The passage suggests that the empires of steppe nomads,  such as the Mongols,  united trade links across Eurasia.

 Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000  pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians.  Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000  or 4,000  Indians working in the mercury mine,  with picks and hammers,  breaking up the ore.  And when they have filled up their little sacks,  the poor fellows,  loaded down,  climb up those ladders and rigging,  so distressing that a man can hardly get up them.  That is the way they work in this mine,  with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion.  Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents.  According to His Majesty's warrant,  the mine owners at PotosÃ­ have a right to the mita of 13,300  Indians.  These mita Indians earn each day 4  reals.  Besides these there are others not under obligation,  who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12  to 16  reals,  and some up to 24,  according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.

 The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control,  they have been forced to pay yasak tribute.  Some have paid in sables,  others in red foxes,  still others in cash.  At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there,  but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands,  from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River.  Moreover,  almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses,  many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.

 Both passages are best seen in the context of which of the following broad developments?  Choices: a) Emerging systems of coerced labor b) The expansion of chattel slavery c) Increased reliance on prison-camp workforces d) Colonization of overseas territories by joint-stock companies 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the common theme in both passages.  In the first passage,  the Indians are forced to work in the mercury mine under harsh conditions and are paid a low wage.  In the second passage,  the Yakut and Tungus natives are forced to pay yasak tribute,  which can be in the form of furbearing animals or cash.  Both situations involve forced labor and exploitation of the natives.

 ""You may well ask: ""Why direct action?  Why sit-ins,  marches and so forth?  Isn't negotiation a better path? "" You are quite right in calling,  for negotiation.  Indeed,  this is the very purpose of direct action.  Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue.  It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored.  My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking.  But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension. "" I have earnestly opposed violent tension,  but there is a type of constructive,  nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth.  Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal,  we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.

 ""The long-term goal of Gay Liberation,  which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society,  is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression.  This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles.  It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.
 As we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone,  and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women's liberation,  we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement,  aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation.

 At the peak of their power,  the domains of the Mongol khans,  or rulers,  made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated.  .  .  .  The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction.  The result was an important new stage in international contact.  From eastern Europe to southern China,  merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property.  The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe,  Asia,  and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere.  The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food,  inventions,  and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries.  Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy,  cosmopolitan cities.  They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions .  .  .  a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.

Choices: a) The colonization of the interior of Africa b) The conquest of the Aztec Empire c) The reformation of Catholic Christianity d) The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key elements of the author's assertion regarding the ""quantum jump"" that would help Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450  and 1750  C.E.  The author mentions exploiting ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump, and this was accomplished by Western Europe through its brutality, guns, and geographical and ecological luck.

Next,  I need to evaluate each choice in the context of these key elements.

a) The colonization of the interior of Africa - This choice aligns with exploiting ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside Western Europe, which fits the author's assertion.

b) The conquest of the Aztec Empire - This choice is specific to the Americas and does not directly relate to the exploitation of continents outside Western Europe in the timeframe mentioned.

c) The reformation of Catholic Christianity - This choice is a religious and ideological change, not directly related to the exploitation of resources or geographical expansion as the author suggests.

d) The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan - This choice is about the lack of expansion, not the exploitation of resources or continents outside Western Europe.

 Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati,  the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility.  To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end,  when the power exists of preventing it,  is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror.  But,  on the other hand,  to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil.  When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security,  expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding,  but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.

 The frontier garrisons run with blood,  enough to fill an ocean,
 But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
 In the hundred districts east of the mountains,  throughout the land of Han,
 There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.

Next,  I need to consider the choices provided and see which one is supported by the poem.  The poem does not mention Confucian relationships between husband and wife, so choice a) is not supported.  The poem does mention that it is better for a family to have a daughter, as she can marry and live with the neighbors, while a son may end up in the army. This suggests that the birth of a son could be seen as a burden, not an advantage, so choice b) is not supported.  The poem does mention that women can handle a hoe and plow, suggesting that agricultural work can be shared by both men and women, so choice c) is supported.  The poem does not mention the reign of Empress Wu Zetian or any changes in traditional gender relations during her reign, so choice d) is not supported.

 An Act to place certain restrictions on Immigration and to provide for the removal from the Commonwealth of Prohibited Immigrants.
 â€¦
3.  The immigration into the Commonwealth of the persons described in any of the following paragraphs in this section (hereinafter called ""prohibited immigrants"") is prohibited,  namely
 (a) Any person who when asked to do so by an officer fails to write out at dictation and sign in the presence of the officer a passage of fifty words in length in a European language directed by the officer;
 (b) Any person in the opinion of the Minister or of an officer to become a charge upon the public or upon any public or charitable organisation;
 â€¦
 (g) Any persons under a contract or agreement to perform manual labour within the Commonwealth: Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to workmen exempted by the Minister for special skill required by Australiaâ€¦
 Immigration Restriction Act of 1901  (Australia)
 Whereas in the opinion of the Government of the United States the coming of Chinese laborers to this country endangers the good order of certain localities within the territory thereof;
 Therefore,
 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,  That from and after the expiration of ninety days next after the passage of this act,  the coming of Chinese laborers to the United States be suspended; and during such suspension it shall not be lawful for any Chinese laborer to come,  or having so come after the expiration of said ninety days to remain within the United States.
 SEC.  2.  That the master of every vessel who shall knowingly bring within the United States on such vessel,  and land or permit to be landed,  any Chinese laborer,  from any foreign port or place,  shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,  and on conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars for each and every such Chinese laborer so brought,  and may be also imprisoned for a term not exceeding one yearâ€¦.
 Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882  (United States)
 The emphasis on language in the first passage is most safely interpreted as Choices: a) a concern for high educational standards in a rapidly growing society.  b) a tactic allowing the exclusion of non-Europeans without referring directly to race.  c) a measure to ensure that all immigrants possessed useful expertise.  d) an attempt to bar all immigrants regardless of origin.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze the purpose of the language used in the first passage,  the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901  (Australia).  The act lists prohibited immigrants,  and one of the criteria is (a) Any person who when asked to do so by an officer fails to write out at dictation and sign in the presence of the officer a passage of fifty words in length in a European language directed by the officer.
 Next,  I need to consider the context of the act.  The act was passed in 1901,  a time when Australia was experiencing rapid population growth due to immigration.  The act aims to place restrictions on immigration and remove prohibited immigrants from the country.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the purpose of the language in the context of the act.  The requirement for immigrants to write in a European language is a way to exclude non-Europeans without directly referring to race.  This tactic allows the act to exclude immigrants based on language,  which is a proxy for European origin.

 This ruler of Syria made me spend many years as commander of his army,
 Every land to which I turned
 I overcame.
 I destroyed its green fields and its wells,
 I captured its cattle,  I took captive its inhabitants,  I deprived them of their provisions,
 and I slew [many] peopleâ€¦by my sword,  my bow,  my marchings,  and my good devices.
 Thus my excellence was in his heart; he loved me and he knew my valor;
 â€¦he set me at the head of his sons,  when he saw the success of my handiwork.
 There came a champion of Syria
 to defy me in my tent;
 a bold man without equal,  for he had vanquished all his rivals.
 He said,  ""Let Sanehat fight with me. ""
 He thought to overcome me; he designed to take my cattle,  thus being counseled by his tribe.
 The Tale of Sanehat,  Egyptian poem written during the Middle Kingdom,  ca.1800  B. C. E.
 Which of the following best describes the most common political significance of conflict between states to the rulers of early civilizations?  Choices: a) Victories against outsiders granted legitimacy to leaders of states.  b) Victories against outsiders provided slaves whose labor sustained agricultural systems.  c) Victories against outsiders demonstrated the power of divinities over other gods.  d) Victories against outsiders allowed leaders of states to incorporate the elites of the subjugated into the conquering power.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze the text and identify the key elements related to the political significance of conflict between states.  The text mentions that the ruler of Syria loved the narrator (Sanehat) because of his valor and success in conquering other lands.  The ruler set Sanehat at the head of his sons after seeing the success of his handiwork.  The text also mentions a champion of Syria coming to defy Sanehat, indicating a desire for victory against outsiders.

Next,  I need to compare the choices given with the information from the text.  Choice a) Victories against outsiders granted legitimacy to leaders of states.  This choice aligns with the text, as the ruler of Syria loved Sanehat for his victories and placed him in a high position.

Choice b) Victories against outsiders provided slaves whose labor sustained agricultural systems.  This choice is not directly supported by the text, as it does not mention slaves or agricultural systems.

Choice c) Victories against outsiders demonstrated the power of divinities over other gods.  This choice is not supported by the text, as it does not mention divinities or the demonstration of their power.

Choice d) Victories against outsiders allowed leaders of states to incorporate the elites of the subjugated into the conquering power.  This choice is not directly supported by the text, as it does not mention the incorporation of elites from subjugated states.

 Which of the following developments from the period 1450 â€“1750  C. E.  most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph?  Choices: a) The eastward expansion of Russia b) The Portuguese conquest of India c) The establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate d) The Spanish conquest of Mexico 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph.  The text states that the Portuguese were trading white silk,  gold,  musk,  and porcelain to Japan and bringing silver and other goods from Japan to China.
 Next,  I need to consider which development from the period 1450 â€“1750  C. E.  most directly affected this trade.  The Portuguese conquest of India (b) would have had a limited impact on trade between China and Japan,  since the text specifically mentions that the Portuguese were trading with Japan and not India.
 The eastward expansion of Russia (a) and the Spanish conquest of Mexico (d) are not directly related to the trade between China and Japan.
 The establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate (c) occurred in 1603,  and it is known for maintaining a strict isolationist policy,  known as sakoku.  This policy limited foreign trade,  including trade with China,  and would have directly affected the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph.

 ""Purusa-Sukta""
 Purusa is the lord of the immortals,  who grow by means of [ritual] food.  When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa,  spring was its clarified butter,  summer the kindling,  autumn the oblation.
 It was Purusa,  born in the beginning,  which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice.  It made the beasts of the air,  the forest and the village.  From that sacrifice completely offered,  the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born.  The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it.  From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws.  The cows were born from it,  also.  From it were born goats and sheep.
 When they divided Purusa,  how many ways did they apportion him?  What was his mouth?  What were his arms?  What were his thighs,  his feet declared to be?  His mouth was the Brahman,  his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya],  his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born.  Thus,  they fashioned the worlds.  The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice.  These were the first rites.

 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key information in the passage.  The passage describes Purusa as the lord of the immortals and the source of the gods.  It describes how the gods divided Purusa in different ways to represent the different castes in Hindu society.  His mouth was the Brahman,  his arms the Rajanya,  his thighs the Vaisya,  and his feet the Sudra.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the given statements based on this information.  Statement a) suggests that the caste system was a social construct of its time,  but the passage does not mention the time period or social factors that led to the creation of the caste system.
 Statement b) suggests that regional princes encouraged the caste system for social stability,  but the passage does not mention any involvement of regional princes.
 Statement c) suggests that the caste system reinforced Indian identity against Muslim invaders,  but the passage does not mention any connection to Muslim invaders.
 Statement d) suggests that the caste system was integral to the Hindu religion,  transcending historical eras.  The passage describes Purusa as the source of the gods and the representation of the different castes,  suggesting that the caste system was an integral part of the Hindu religion.

 North Atlantic Treaty,  April 4,  1949
 The North Atlantic Treaty in the passage above most clearly supports which of the following concepts?  Choices: a) Capitalism b) Collective defense c) Mutually assured destruction d) Communism 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key concepts in the North Atlantic Treaty.  The treaty mentions the purpose of the United Nations,  peaceful means to settle disputes,  refraining from the threat or use of force,  strengthening free institutions,  promoting conditions of stability and well-being,  economic collaboration,  maintaining and developing individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack,  and agreeing to assist in the event of an armed attack.
 Next,  I need to match these concepts to the given choices.  Capitalism is an economic system characterized by private ownership of the means of production and the pursuit of profit.  The treaty does not explicitly support capitalism.  Collective defense is the principle that states agree to defend each other in the event of an attack.  The treaty explicitly supports this concept in Article 5.  Mutually assured destruction is a doctrine of military strategy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would result in the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender.  The treaty does not support this concept.  Communism is an economic and political system characterized by communal ownership of property and the absence of a private class.  The treaty does not explicitly support communism.

 Questions to the passage below,  an account given to a French officer in Algeria in the 1830 s by a member of an Arab slave trade caravan.
 The Slave Trade
 All of you [soldiers],  are summoned .  .  .  to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""].  .  .  .  The soldiery divided themselves into two companies .  .  .  with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields.  .  .  .  Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes,  we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
 A Negro with beardâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦10  or 15,000  cowries.
 They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
 An adult Negressâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..10  or 15,000  cowries for the same reasons
 An adolescent Negroâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.30,000  cowries
 A young Negress â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦50 â€“60,000  cowries
 The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
 A male Negro childâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..45,000  cowries
 A female Negro child â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.35 â€“40,000  cowries
 Finally,  our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons,  was now augmented by four hundred slaves,  of whom three hundred were women.  .  .  .  It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own.  .  .  .  Some rolled on the ground,  clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk.  .  .  .  They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.
 Which statement best supports the argument that religion played a role in the Arab slave trade?  Choices: a) Seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields b) With orders to attack places without defenses c) Four hundred slaves,  of whom three hundred were women d) All of you soldiers,  are summoned .  .  .  to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the statement that provides evidence of the role of religion in the Arab slave trade.  The passage mentions that ""All of you [soldiers],  are summoned .  .  .  to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""].""  This statement suggests that the slave trade was motivated by religious beliefs,  as the soldiers are being called to hunt a specific group of people based on their perceived religious beliefs or practices.

 ""The greatest contribution that Africa can make to the peace of the world is to avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity,  by creating a political union which will also by its success,  stand as an example to a divided world.  A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality.  It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence.  The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara,  and the ignominious spectacle of the U. N.  in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy,  are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers. ""

 The passage is most clearly an example of which of the following?  Choices: a) Responses to failed unification attempts in Africa b) A plea for the United Nations to intervene in Africa c) A proposal to increase the standing of Africa in the modern world d) Ardent opposition to the influence of capitalism in Africa 
 Output:
 First,  I will analyze the main ideas presented in the passage.  The author discusses the importance of unity and political union in Africa to avoid internal dangers and to project a stronger personality on the global stage.  He also mentions the lack of respect and attention from the Great Powers towards African Independence and the United Nations' inaction in the Congo.

Second,  I will compare these ideas to the given choices.  Choice a) Responses to failed unification attempts in Africa does not fit the passage,  as the author is not discussing failed attempts but rather advocating for unity.  Choice b) A plea for the United Nations to intervene in Africa is not the main focus of the passage,  as the author is more concerned with the UN's inaction and the overall neglect of African Independence.  Choice d) Ardent opposition to the influence of capitalism in Africa is not mentioned in the passage.

Third,  I will identify the choice that best fits the passage's main ideas.  Choice c) A proposal to increase the standing of Africa in the modern world aligns with the author's call for a Union of African states to command respect and project a stronger personality on the global stage.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati,  the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility.  To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end,  when the power exists of preventing it,  is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror.  But,  on the other hand,  to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil.  When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security,  expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding,  but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.
 William Bentinck,  Govenor-General of India,  ""On the Suppression of Sati, "" 1829
 I have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us],  and however repugnant it may be to our feelings,  I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron,  to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination,  and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].
 George Simpson,  Head of Northern Department,  Hudson's Bay Company,  1826
 The first passage can be said to undermine which commonly held assumption about Western imperialism?  Choices: a) That European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices b) That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits c) That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations d) That European colonizers often resorted to armed force to impose their will on imperial subjects 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the main idea of the first passage.  The passage discusses the decision to continue or discontinue the practice of sati,  a Hindu custom where widows are burned alive.  The Governor-General of India,  William Bentinck,  argues that it is a difficult decision,  but he believes that stopping the practice is the right thing to do.
 Next,  I need to compare this main idea to the given choices.  The passage does not focus on profits,  armed force,  or the imposition of cultural norms.  However,  it does mention that European colonizers interfered with native religious practices.

 Know the self to be sitting in the chariot,  the body to be the chariot,  the intellect the charioteer,  and the mind the reins.  He who has understanding,  who is mindful and always pure,  indeed reaches that place from whence he is not born again.
 from the Upanishads,  India,  circa 600 sâ€“400 s B. C. E.
 Compared to the message communicated by the excerpt,  Buddhist doctrine regarding reincarnation most resembled Hinduism in that it Choices: a) retained the concept of karma.  b) proposed a heavenly existence after death.  c) rejected the validity of all gods.  d) mandated unquestioning obedience to the priestly class.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the message communicated by the excerpt.  The excerpt is from the Upanishads,  which is a Hindu scripture.  It compares the self to a charioteer and the body to a chariot,  suggesting that the self has control over the body and its actions.  The mind is the reins,  meaning it controls the charioteer (the intellect),  and thus the entire chariot.  The message is that by controlling the mind,  one can achieve liberation from the cycle of rebirth.
 Next,  I need to consider the Buddhist doctrine regarding reincarnation.  Buddhism also believes in the cycle of birth,  death,  and rebirth,  known as samsara.  However,  Buddhism teaches that the cycle of samsara can be broken by understanding the true nature of reality and practicing the Noble Eightfold Path.  The key to breaking the cycle is the concept of karma,  which is the law of cause and effect.  Good actions lead to positive consequences,  and bad actions lead to negative consequences.

 Stalin's speech is most strongly influenced by which of the following?  Choices: a) Appeasement b) Fascism c) Communism d) Secret treaties 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze the content of Stalin's speech.  The speech emphasizes the importance of not falling behind and not being weak,  as those who are weak are beaten and exploited.  The speech also discusses the history of Russia being beaten due to its backwardness.  The main goal is to avoid being beaten and to be strong and forward-thinking.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices provided.  a) Appeasement refers to giving in to the demands of an aggressor to avoid conflict.  b) Fascism is a political ideology characterized by dictatorial power,  forbidden opposition,  and strong nationalism.  c) Communism is a political and economic theory advocating the communal ownership of all property and means of production.  d) Secret treaties are agreements made between countries without the knowledge of their citizens.
 Finally,  I need to determine which of these choices best fits the influence of Stalin's speech.  The speech emphasizes the importance of strength,  forward-thinking,  and not being weak,  which aligns with the principles of communism.  Communism focuses on the communal ownership of property and means of production,  which can lead to a strong and forward-thinking society.

 Why do you allow your children to go to work at those places where they are ill-treated or over-worked?
 â€”Necessity compels a man that has children to let them work.
 Then you would not allow your children to go to those factories under the present system,  if it was not from necessity?

 Which style of government is most associated with limited regulations on business and working conditions similar to those described in the passage?  Choices: a) Laissez-faire b) Totalitarian c) Utilitarian d) Corporatist 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key elements of the passage that relate to the question.  The passage describes a situation where workers are subjected to low wages,  ill-treated or over-worked conditions,  and children are forced to work in these factories due to necessity.
 Next,  I need to consider which style of government is most associated with limited regulations on business and working conditions.  Laissez-faire is a political and economic philosophy that advocates for minimal government intervention in the economy,  allowing businesses and individuals to act freely.  This philosophy is associated with limited regulations on business and working conditions.

 By what principle of reason then,  should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug?  Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts,  we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain,  they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us!  And such being the case,  we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men?  We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity.  This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind.  Since you do not permit it to injure your own country,  you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country,  and above all others,  how much less to the Inner Land!  Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries,  there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.
 Lin Zexu,  Chinese trade commissioner,  letter to Queen Victoria,  1839
 Which of the outcomes listed below followed the delivery of Lin Zexu's letter?  Choices: a) Chinese naval defeat and new trade terms more favorable to the West b) A successful ban of the opium trade in all Chinese territories c) Violent uprisings on the part of China's pro-British Muslim minority d) The expulsion of all foreigners from Chinese territory 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the main issue addressed in Lin Zexu's letter.  The letter is about the opium trade,  and Lin Zexu argues that the British are importing a harmful substance (opium) into China without any concern for the consequences.
 Next,  I need to consider the context of the time.  The letter was written in 1839,  during the Opium Wars,  when Britain was exporting opium to China.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the possible outcomes based on the content of the letter.  Lin Zexu's letter was a strong condemnation of the British actions and a call for an end to the opium trade.
 The delivery of Lin Zexu's letter led to the British government taking notice of the issue and eventually agreeing to stop the opium trade.  However,  this was not achieved through a complete ban of the opium trade in all Chinese territories,  but rather through a temporary cessation of the trade.

 But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness.  Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and,  as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports,  the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight.  .  .  .  The victorious legions,  who,  in distant wars,  acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries,  first oppressed the freedom of the republic,  and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple.  The emperors,  anxious for their personal safety and the public peace,  were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military .  .  .  was relaxed .  .  .  ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.
 â€”Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,  by Edward Gibbon
 The author of the above passage claims: ""Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest. "" What does he mean by this?  Choices: a) The rulers became too rich and thus were overthrown.  b) The empire became too large to control effectively.  c) Decay begins the minute something begins to grow.  d) Conquest and prosperity are mutually exclusive.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the author's claim about prosperity and its relation to decay.  The author states that ""Prosperity ripened the principle of decay,"" which means that prosperity or success actually contributed to the eventual decline or decay of Rome.
 Next,  the author mentions that ""the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest."" This suggests that as Rome expanded and conquered more territories, the factors leading to its downfall increased.

 ""Thereupon it was declared by the above-mentioned representatives of the aforesaid King and Queen of Castile,  Leon,  Aragon,  Sicily,  Granada,  etc.,  and of the aforesaid King of Portugal and the Algarves,  etc. :
 [I. ] That,  whereas a certain controversy exists between the said lords,  their constituents,  as to what lands,  of all those discovered in the ocean sea up to the present day,  the date of this treaty,  pertain to each one of the said parts respectively; therefore,  for the sake of peace and concord,  and for the preservation of the relationship and love of the said King of Portugal for the said King and Queen of Castile,  Aragon,  etc.,  it being the pleasure of their Highnesses,  they,  their said representatives,  acting in their name and by virtue of their powers herein described,  covenanted and agreed that a boundary or straight line be determined and drawn north and south,  from pole to pole,  on the said ocean sea,  from the Arctic to the Antarctic pole.

 Treaty of Tordesillas,  1494
 Which of the following inferences best explains the reason the King of Portugal insisted on Portuguese control of territory east of the demarcation line?  Choices: a) Portuguese explorers were convinced that the route to the New World was easier traveled by going east.  b) The Portuguese desired to continue the crusades against the Mamelukes who controlled the Holy Land.  c) The Portuguese desired control of the wealthy lands of Mexico.  d) The Portuguese knew of a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope in the south of Africa.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the Treaty of Tordesillas.  The treaty was signed in 1494 between the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon (later becoming the Kingdom of Spain) and the Kingdom of Portugal.  The main purpose of the treaty was to divide the newly discovered lands outside Europe between the two kingdoms.

Next,  I need to identify the reason behind the King of Portugal insisting on Portuguese control of territory east of the demarcation line.  The text mentions that all lands found or to be found hereafter,  discovered or to be discovered hereafter,  which have been discovered or shall be discovered by the said King of Portugal and by his vessels on this side of the said line and bound determined as above,  toward the east,  in either north or south latitude,  on the eastern side of the said bound provided the said bound is not crossed,  shall belong to,  and remain in the possession of,  and pertain forever to,  the said King of Portugal and his successors.

Now,  I need to evaluate the given choices and find the one that best explains the reason for the King of Portugal's insistence.  Choice a) suggests that Portuguese explorers believed the route to the New World was easier by going east,  which is not mentioned in the text.  Choice b) mentions the crusades against the Mamelukes,  which is not related to the text's focus on the division of newly discovered lands.  Choice c) suggests that the Portuguese desired control of the wealthy lands of Mexico,  but the text does not mention Mexico or its wealth.  Choice d) states that the Portuguese knew of a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope,  which is consistent with the text's focus on the division of newly discovered lands and the Portuguese's interest in the east.

 Alike from Rhine and Prague,
 And more than that-shame and dismay

 Right well they know this thing,
 That Ferdinand alone can be

 ""Poor Winter King, "" seventeenth-century song
 Which of the following events inspired the composition of this song?  Choices: a) Peace of Augsburg b) War of Spanish Succession c) Edict of Nantes d) Thirty Years' War 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key elements of the song that provide clues to the historical event it refers to.  The song mentions the ""kaiser's crown,"" ""Ferdinand alone can be Bohemia's lawful king,"" and the ""Winter King."" These references suggest a conflict over the throne in Bohemia.
 Next,  I need to consider the historical context of these references. The Peace of Augsburg (a) was a treaty between the Holy Roman Empire and France, focusing on the religious differences within the empire. The War of Spanish Succession (b) was a European conflict over the succession of the Spanish throne after the death of Charles II. The Edict of Nantes (c) was a treaty that granted religious freedom to Protestants in France. The Thirty Years' War (d) was a major European conflict that involved the Holy Roman Empire, Bohemia, and other European powers, and was partly fought over the issue of religious and political control in the region.
 Comparing the historical context of each choice to the references in the song, it is clear that the Thirty Years' War (d) is the most relevant event, as it involved conflicts over the throne in Bohemia and the struggle between the Habsburg and House of Bourbon claimants to the Bohemian and Austrian thrones, which includes the ""kaiser's crown"" and the ""Winter King"" mentioned in the song.

We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or perish with it; now in this situation,  the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror.

 The passage above appears to articulate which of the following political principles?  Choices: a) From each according to his abilities,  to each according to his needs b) Might makes right c) The end justifies the means d) The government is best that governs least 
 Output:

 Finally,  I need to determine which principle best aligns with the passage's emphasis on the use of terror.  The passage does not discuss distribution of resources (a), the concept that power is determined by might (b), or the idea that the government should have limited involvement in people's lives (d).  However,  it does suggest that the use of terror is justified as a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to the country's urgent needs, implying that the means (terror) are justified if they serve the greater good.

 ""Purusa-Sukta""
 Purusa is the lord of the immortals,  who grow by means of [ritual] food.  When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa,  spring was its clarified butter,  summer the kindling,  autumn the oblation.
 It was Purusa,  born in the beginning,  which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice.  It made the beasts of the air,  the forest and the village.  From that sacrifice completely offered,  the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born.  The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it.  From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws.  The cows were born from it,  also.  From it were born goats and sheep.
 When they divided Purusa,  how many ways did they apportion him?  What was his mouth?  What were his arms?  What were his thighs,  his feet declared to be?  His mouth was the Brahman,  his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya],  his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born.  Thus,  they fashioned the worlds.  The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice.  These were the first rites.

They are Muslims keeping to the prayers,  studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart.  With regard to their women,  they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers.  He who wishes to marry among them can marry,  but the women do not travel with the husband,  and if one of them wanted to do that,  she would be prevented by her family.  The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i. e.,  other than brothers,  fathers,  etc. ].

 ""MAHATMA GANDHI'S MESSAGE.
 REMAIN NON-VIOLENT
 The following message was sent by Mahatma Gandhi from Waltair:â€”
 Maulana Mohamed AH was arrested at Waltair under sections 107  and 108  to be called upon to give security,  to be of good behaviour for one year.  The place and date of trial is unknown.
 The Begum Saheba and Mr.  Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.
 He and I were going to address a meeting outside the station.  He was arrested.  I continued going to the meeting and addressed them.  There is no cause for sorrow,  but every cause for congratulation.  There should be no hartal.  Perfect peace and calmness should be observed.  I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs,  if we can remain non-violent.  Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs,  and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.
 I hope every Indian,  man or woman,  will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.
 By striving like the Maulana,  be insistent on religious and national rights.
 Let us earn imprisonment.  I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal. ""
 Mohandas Gandhi,  The Pilgrims' March,  1921
 Which of the following historical developments most assisted the ultimate success of the boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph?  Choices: a) Pressure on colonial powers by the Soviet Union to retreat from their colonies b) The Great Depression that started in 1929  c) The decolonization process already underway in Africa d) World War II 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the historical development that most assisted the ultimate success of the boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph.  The boycott mentioned is the complete boycott of foreign cloth.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given and evaluate their impact on the boycott.  a) Pressure on colonial powers by the Soviet Union to retreat from their colonies,  b) The Great Depression that started in 1929,  c) The decolonization process already underway in Africa,  and d) World War II.
 To determine the most relevant choice,  I need to consider the time period and context of the boycott.  The boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph occurred in 1921,  during the period of British colonial rule in India.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the choices in the context of the boycott.  a) Pressure on colonial powers by the Soviet Union to retreat from their colonies is not relevant,  as the Soviet Union was not a colonial power in India.
 b) The Great Depression that started in 1929 is not relevant,  as it occurred after the boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph.
 c) The decolonization process already underway in Africa is relevant,  as it could have inspired Indians to fight for their independence and rights,  potentially supporting the boycott.
 d) World War II is not relevant,  as it occurred after the boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 ""The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries.  It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.
 Non-alignment,  as practiced by Ghana and many other countries,  is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist,  socialist or have a mixed economy.  Such a policy,  therefore,  involves foreign investment from capitalist countries,  but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind.  The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investmentsâ€¦The question is one of power.  A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny. ""
 Kwame Nkrumah,  Neo-Colonialism,  1965
 Which of the following would most directly result from the foreign investment from capitalist countries mentioned in the second paragraph?  Choices: a) The establishment of formal control over previous colonies by colonial powers b) The establishment of successful democratic regimes in targets of foreign investment c) The development of globalization and the spread of culture through consumerism d) The reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the question.  The passage discusses the concept of non-alignment and foreign investment from capitalist countries.  The key point is that such investment must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind.
 The question asks which of the following would most directly result from this foreign investment.
 a) The establishment of formal control over previous colonies by colonial powers - This option is not directly related to the passage,  which focuses on the use of foreign investment for national plans.
 b) The establishment of successful democratic regimes in targets of foreign investment - The passage does not specifically mention the impact of foreign investment on the establishment of democratic regimes.
 c) The development of globalization and the spread of culture through consumerism - While foreign investment can contribute to globalization,  the passage specifically states that the issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments,  so this option is not the most direct result.
 d) The reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies - The passage mentions that a state in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny,  which implies that foreign investment used in a way that benefits the host country can lead to a reduction in political instability and unrest.

 First,  I need to analyze the texts and identify the common themes.  In the Epic of Gilgamesh,  the House of Darkness represents a place of no return and darkness,  suggesting an afterlife or a punishment for wrongdoing.  In the Maxims of Ptahhotep,  the passage about the gods guiding certain people and forbidding others from crossing the river of life also suggests an afterlife or punishment for wrongdoing.

 A soldier says simply: ""They call up more every day.
 ""Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
 And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
 On our first tour,  the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
 When we came back,  our hair was white,  but still there's more unrest.
 The frontier garrisons run with blood,  enough to fill an ocean,
 But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
 In the hundred districts east of the mountains,  throughout the land of Han,
 There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
 Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
 The crops grow every which way,  the fields are all a mess.
 It's hardest for the Shanxi men,  with their reputations as fighters:
 They're rounded up like dogs or chickens,  every male impressed.
 ""But sir,  though it's good of you to ask,
 Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
 We can only shake our heads.  Take this winter:
 The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
 The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
 But where will it come from?  You can't get blood from a stone!

 It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
 And live with the neighbors next door.
 But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie. ""

 First,  I need to analyze the tone of the first letter.  The letter complains about the kidnapping of people by Europeans,  and expresses frustration with the demand for goods from the Europeans.  The letter also mentions that the people are keenly desirous of European goods.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices and see which one is reflected in the tone of the letter.  The letter does not talk about resistance to European expeditions,  nor does it mention the establishment of Portuguese trading posts or the consolidation of states along the coast.
 However,  the letter does mention the desire for European goods and the issue of kidnapping people to satisfy this desire.  This suggests a growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods.

 Based on your knowledge of world history,  which of the following contributed LEAST to Western European global hegemony between 1450  and 1750  C. E.?  Choices: a) The exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe b) Refinement of gunpowder technologies c) The development and application of steam-powered technologies d) The implementation of joint-stock companies 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the historical context and the factors that contributed to Western European global hegemony between 1450  and 1750.  The exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe,  refinement of gunpowder technologies,  development and application of steam-powered technologies,  and implementation of joint-stock companies are all significant factors.

Next,  I need to evaluate the impact of each factor on Western European global hegemony.  The exchange of food sources,  such as the introduction of new crops like corn,  potatoes,  and tomatoes to Europe,  had a significant impact on European agriculture and population growth.  However,  it may not have been the most critical factor in global hegemony.

The refinement of gunpowder technologies,  such as the development of cannons and muskets,  played a crucial role in the European conquest of the Americas and the ability to project power over long distances.  This factor was undoubtedly significant.

The development and application of steam-powered technologies,  such as steam engines and railways,  were instrumental in the Industrial Revolution and the economic growth of Western Europe.  This factor was also significant.

The implementation of joint-stock companies,  such as the East India Company,  allowed for the pooling of capital and the establishment of overseas trade and colonization.  This factor was also significant in facilitating global hegemony.

Considering the historical context and the impact of each factor,  it is clear that the exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe had a significant impact,  but it may not have been the least contributing factor to Western European global hegemony.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

 ""We are not Europeans; we are not Indians; we are but a mixed species of aborigines and Spaniards.  Americans by birth and Europeans by law,  we find ourselves engaged in a dual conflict: we are disputing with the natives for titles of ownership,  and at the same time we are struggling to maintain ourselves in the country that gave us birth against the opposition of the invaders.  Thus our position is most extraordinary and complicated.  But there is more.  As our role has always been strictly passive and political existence nil,  we find that our quest for liberty is now even more difficult of accomplishment; for we,  having been placed in a state lower than slavery,  had been robbed not only of our freedom but also of the right to exercise an active domestic tyrannyâ€¦We have been ruled more by deceit than by force,  and we have been degraded more by vice than by superstition.  Slavery is the daughter of darkness: an ignorant people is a blind instrument of its own destruction.

The passage mentions ""we are disputing with the natives for titles of ownership,""  and ""we are struggling to maintain ourselves in the country that gave us birth against the opposition of the invaders.""  These details suggest that the passage is about a struggle for independence.

 Next,  I need to consider the impact of European demand for Chinese goods.  The passage mentions that the Chinese emperor has no interest in European goods and does not value them.
 The passage does not mention any impact on the Portuguese's international power or prestige,  so option a) is not the correct answer.
 The passage also does not mention any shift in British focus to Japan or control of the Malacca Strait,  so options b) and d) are not the correct answers.
 The passage does mention that the Chinese emperor has no use for European manufactures and that strange and costly objects do not interest him.

To their narrative,  which they gave in the regular order of events,  and delivered in perspicuous language,  he listened with attentive silence.  The letters and the presents from pope Gregory were then laid before him,  and,  upon hearing the former read,  he bestowed much commendation on the fidelity,  the zeal,  and the diligence of his ambassadors; and receiving with due reverence the oil from the holy sepulchre,  he gave directions that it should be preserved with religious care.

And on account of their return he made a great feast and rejoicing; and as long as the said brothers and Marco remained in the court of the grand Khan,  they were honored even above his own courtiers.  Marco was held in high estimation and respect by all belonging to the court.  He learnt in a short time and adopted the manners of the Tartars,  and acquired a proficiency in four different languages,  which he became qualified to read and write. ""
 Marco Polo's Travels,  ca.  1300  C. E.
 The encounter described in the account above illustrates which of the following?  Choices: a) The economic dominance of the Ottoman Empire b) The influence of Middle Eastern religious beliefs on the peoples of South Asia c) The lack of cooperation among major political groups in the High Middle Ages d) Amiable cultural exchange between Europe and Asia 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key elements of the encounter described in the text.  The encounter involves Marco Polo and his brothers presenting themselves to the grand Khan,  who is the ruler of a vast Asian empire.  They are received honorably and their travels and negotiations with the pope are discussed.  The grand Khan is impressed by Marco Polo and makes him an honorary attendant.  The grand Khan also shows hospitality by hosting a feast in their honor.

Next,  I need to consider the choices given and see which one best fits the encounter described.  a) The economic dominance of the Ottoman Empire is not relevant because the text does not mention the Ottoman Empire.  b) The influence of Middle Eastern religious beliefs on the peoples of South Asia is not relevant because the text does not mention any religious beliefs or peoples from South Asia.  c) The lack of cooperation among major political groups in the High Middle Ages is not relevant because the text shows cooperation between the European and Asian powers represented by the pope and the grand Khan, respectively.

d) Amiable cultural exchange between Europe and Asia is relevant because the encounter shows a peaceful interaction between the European and Asian powers,  with the grand Khan showing hospitality and respect to Marco Polo and his brothers.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

 ""We are not Europeans; we are not Indians; we are but a mixed species of aborigines and Spaniards.  Americans by birth and Europeans by law,  we find ourselves engaged in a dual conflict: we are disputing with the natives for titles of ownership,  and at the same time we are struggling to maintain ourselves in the country that gave us birth against the opposition of the invaders.  Thus our position is most extraordinary and complicated.  But there is more.  As our role has always been strictly passive and political existence nil,  we find that our quest for liberty is now even more difficult of accomplishment; for we,  having been placed in a state lower than slavery,  had been robbed not only of our freedom but also of the right to exercise an active domestic tyrannyâ€¦We have been ruled more by deceit than by force,  and we have been degraded more by vice than by superstition.

 And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines.  The Indians,  under the pretext of mining chores,  are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains,  and the Indians die.  These Indians are not paid for their labor,  and their work is kept hidden.
 And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubinesâ€¦. And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]â€¦at their own expense,  and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays.  In this way,  the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt,  and they have no way to pay their tribute.

 That day the Reverend Xuanzang was chosen from among all the monks.  He had been a monk from infancy,  and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitions.  His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander,  Yin Kaishan.  His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library.  Xuanzang,  however,  had no interest in honour and glory,  and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana.  His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know.
 â€¦
 He looked to the West and prayed,  ""I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures.  If I am fated to have a disciple,  may I be able to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King to come with me to the Vulture Peak.  If I am not fated to have a disciple,  and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good,  then may I be unable to remove the seal. "" When he had prayed he bowed again.

 ""Purusa-Sukta""
 Purusa is the lord of the immortals,  who grow by means of [ritual] food.  When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa,  spring was its clarified butter,  summer the kindling,  autumn the oblation.
 It was Purusa,  born in the beginning,  which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice.  It made the beasts of the air,  the forest and the village.  From that sacrifice completely offered,  the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born.  The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it.  From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws.  The cows were born from it,  also.  From it were born goats and sheep.
 When they divided Purusa,  how many ways did they apportion him?  What was his mouth?  What were his arms?  What were his thighs,  his feet declared to be?  His mouth was the Brahman,  his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya],  his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born.  Thus,  they fashioned the worlds.  The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice.  These were the first rites.

Choices: a) For there is nothing better for a Kshatriya than a righteous battle.  b) The four divisions of human society are created by me Krishna.  c) The person traditionally credited with composing the Mahabarata was born to a fisherwoman.  d) The Hindu God Shiva is considered to be simultaneously the creator,  the preserver,  and the destroyer.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the argument that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles on Indian society in the period 600  BCE to 600  CE.  The Purusa-Sukta hymn describes Purusa as being divided into different parts,  each representing a different caste.  The mouth represents the Brahman,  the arms the Rajanya (Ksatriya),  the thighs the Vaisya,  and the feet the Sudra.  This suggests that the caste system was based on the division of Purusa.
 Next,  I need to find an option that would best contradict this argument.  Option a) is about the Kshatriya caste's duty,  option b) is a statement by Krishna about the creation of the caste system,  option c) is about the birth of a famous work,  and option d) is about the nature of a Hindu God.
 Option c) directly contradicts the argument by stating that the person traditionally credited with composing the Mahabharata,  a major work from the period,  was born to a fisherwoman,  which would have been a low caste according to the rigid social roles imposed by the caste system.

Secondly,  one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system.

 Second,  I need to evaluate each choice in the context of the passage.
 a) The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers - This choice directly relates to the passage, as it discusses the imperialist system and the exploitation of Africa by Western European capitalists.
 b) The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World - This choice is related to the broader impact of European colonization but does not specifically address the passage's focus on the economic retardation of Africa.
 c) The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa - This choice is a religious development and does not directly address the economic or imperial aspects discussed in the passage.
 d) The importation of New World products into Africa - This choice is related to trade but does not specifically address the exploitation and economic retardation of Africa by the imperialist system.

 The following poem refers to an incident in Sharpeville,  South Africa,  in 1960.  To protest the requirement that they carry papers documenting their identity and residence,  black South Africans gathered in front of police stations without their papers.  Though other protests ended peacefully,  in Sharpeville,  police fired into the crowd.
 What is important
 about Sharpeville
 is not that seventy died:
 nor even that they were shot in the back
 retreating,  unarmed,  defenceless
 and certainty not
 the heavy caliber slug
 that tore through a mother's back
 and ripped through the child in her arms
 killing it
 Remember Sharpeville
 bullet-in-the-back day
 Because it epitomized oppression
 and the nature of society
 More clearly than anything else;
 it was the classic event
 Nowhere is racial dominance
 more clearly defined
 nowhere the will to oppress
 more clearly demonstrated
 What the world whispers
 apartheid declares with snarling guns
 the blood the rich lust after
 South Africa spills dust
 Remember Sharpeville
 Remember bullet-in-the-back day
 And remember the unquenchable will for freedom
 Remember the dead
 and be glad

 What does the poet mean by ""what the world whispers""?  Choices: a) The world is too afraid of South Africa to oppose apartheid.  b) The world engages in subtler forms of discrimination.  c) The world condemns South Africaâ€™s discrimination.  d) The world economy promotes South Africaâ€™s discrimination.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the poem.  The poem refers to the Sharpeville massacre,  an event in which police fired into a crowd of unarmed protesters,  killing seventy people.  The poem discusses the importance of remembering Sharpeville and the nature of society.
 The line ""what the world whispers"" refers to the subtle forms of discrimination that exist in the world,  which are not as overt as apartheid but still contribute to the oppressive nature of society.

 Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept.  He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive.  He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea,  or were already there.  The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa,  600  miles away.  His problem,  therefore,  was to compose a surrender arrangement which,  while acceptable to the Russians,  would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea.  If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea,  the United States would be unable to stop them.  .  .  .  He decided to use the 38 th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.

 ""Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighboring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves.  Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy.  If we look to the laws,  they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing,  advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity,  class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way,  if a man is able to serve the state,  he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition.  The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life.  There,  far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other,  we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes,  or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive,  although they inflict no positive penalty.  But all this ease in our private relations does not make us lawless as citizens.  Against this fear is our chief safeguard,  teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws,  particularly such as regard the protection of the injured,  whether they are actually on the statute book,  or belong to that code which,  although unwritten,  yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace.

 Seizing me,  he led me down to the House of Darknessâ€¦
 To the house where those who enter do not come out,
 Along the road of no return,
 To the house where those who dwell,  do without light,
 Where dirt is their drink,  their food is of clayâ€¦
 Where light cannot be seen.  They dwell in the dark,
 And upon the door and bolt,  there lies dust.
 from Tablet VII,  The Epic of Gilgamesh,  Sumeria,  ca.  2100  B. C. E.
 Truth is good and its worth is lasting.
 It has not been disturbed since the day of its creator,
 Whereas he who transgresses its ordinances is punished.

 Those whom the gods guide cannot lose themselves.
 Those to whom they forbid passage will not be able to cross the river of life.

The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]â€¦. The owners and stewards of the mines,  whether Spaniards,  mestizos,  or Indians,  are such tyrants,  with no fear of God or Justice,  because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a yearâ€¦.
 And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines.  The Indians,  under the pretext of mining chores,  are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains,  and the Indians die.  These Indians are not paid for their labor,  and their work is kept hidden.
 And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubinesâ€¦. And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]â€¦at their own expense,  and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays.  In this way,  the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt,  and they have no way to pay their tribute.

 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the historical context of the poem.  The poem is an adaptation of ""To Roosevelt"" by Ruben Dario,  written in 1904.  This is a long time before the events of the Zimmerman Telegram (1917),  the embargo of Cuba after Castro's revolution (1959),  U. S.  involvement in Panama's independence (1903),  and U.

 Next,  I need to consider the themes of the poem.  The poet refers to the United States as an invader and compares it to historical conquerors like Alexander and Nebuchadnezzar.  He praises the rich history and culture of Latin America and warns the United States of its potential consequences.
 Finally,  I need to match the themes of the poem with the historical events that would have prompted such a response.  The U. S.  involvement in Panama's independence in 1903 is the closest match,  as it was a significant event that could have sparked a reaction from Latin American poets.

 But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness.

The victorious legions,  who,  in distant wars,  acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries,  first oppressed the freedom of the republic,  and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple.

 What term best describes Peter the Great's ruling style as described in the passage?  Choices: a) Egalitarian b) Absolutist c) Republican d) Theocratic 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze the passage to understand Peter the Great's ruling style.  The passage states that he was convinced that if Russia was to be transformed,  it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force.  He would try to lead,  but where education and persuasion were not enough,  he could driveâ€”and if necessary flogâ€”the backward nation forward.
 This indicates that Peter the Great had a strong desire to control and direct the transformation of Russia,  using both persuasion and force if necessary.

 I walk alongside the column,  ask what's going on.
 A soldier says simply: ""They call up more every day.
 ""Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
 And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
 On our first tour,  the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
 When we came back,  our hair was white,  but still there's more unrest.
 The frontier garrisons run with blood,  enough to fill an ocean,
 But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
 In the hundred districts east of the mountains,  throughout the land of Han,
 There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
 Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
 The crops grow every which way,  the fields are all a mess.
 It's hardest for the Shanxi men,  with their reputations as fighters:
 They're rounded up like dogs or chickens,  every male impressed.
 ""But sir,  though it's good of you to ask,
 Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
 We can only shake our heads.  Take this winter:
 The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
 The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
 But where will it come from?  You can't get blood from a stone!
 I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
 It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
 And live with the neighbors next door.
 But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie. ""

 First,  I need to identify the key differences between the Tang dynasty and the Song dynasty.  The text provided by Du Fu's ""Ballad of the Army Carts"" does not directly mention the abolition of Confucian civil service exams,  so I will not consider this option.
 Next,  the text does not mention the Song dynasty's sponsorship of Buddhism or its impact on Taoism and Confucianism,  so I will not consider this option either.
 The text does discuss the frontier garrisons and unrest,  which suggests that the Song dynasty pursued a less expansive foreign policy.
 Finally,  the text does not mention the origin of the Song dynasty,  so I will not consider this option.

 The city of Ghana consists of two towns.  One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques,  salaried imams and muezzins,  and jurists and scholars.  In the environs are wells with sweet water,  from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables.  .  .  .  The king's interpreters,  the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims.  Only royalty may wear sewn clothes.  All other people wear robes of cotton,  silk,  or brocade,  according to their means.  .  .  .  The king adorns himself like a woman,  wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms.  .  .  .  He sits .  .  .  in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses.  When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads,  for this is their way of greeting him.  As for the Muslims,  they greet him only by clapping their hands.  [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols.  .  .  .  On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar,  and two dinars when it is sent out.  From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals,  and from a load of other goods ten mithqals.  .  .  .  The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king,  only this gold dust being left for the people.  But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value.

 What is the most likely explanation for a Muslim being in charge of the Ghanian treasury?  Choices: a) To facilitate trade with the predominantly Muslim merchants during this era.  b) The king of Ghana had recently become a Muslim.  c) Merchants and trade were considered taboo in the traditional pagan religion.  d) African kings were merely vassals of the Muslim caliphs.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the historical context of the Ghana Empire during the eleventh century.  The text suggests that the king and many of his officials were Muslims,  while the majority of the population practiced paganism and worshipped idols.
 Next,  I need to analyze the possible reasons for a Muslim being in charge of the treasury.  Option a) suggests that the Muslim in charge of the treasury would facilitate trade with Muslim merchants,  but there is no mention of a significant Muslim presence in the Ghana Empire or its trade relations in the text.
 Option b) suggests that the king of Ghana had recently become a Muslim,  which could explain the presence of a Muslim in charge of the treasury.  The text mentions that the king's interpreters,  treasury official,  and many ministers were Muslims,  which supports this possibility.
 Option c) suggests that merchants and trade were considered taboo in the traditional pagan religion,  but there is no mention of such taboos in the text.
 Option d) suggests that African kings were vassals of the Muslim caliphs,  but there is no evidence in the text to support this claim.

Based on the analysis,  the most likely explanation for a Muslim being in charge of the Ghanian treasury is that the king of Ghana had recently become a Muslim (option b).  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

The kingdom of the Greeks is now dismembered by them and deprived of territory so vast in extent that it cannot be traversed in a march of two months.  On whom therefore is the labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering this territory incumbent,  if not upon you?

 First,  I need to identify the key elements of the third paragraph.  The paragraph discusses Jerusalem as the navel of the world,  fruitful above others,  made illustrious by Christ's advent,  beautified by His residence,  consecrated by His suffering,  redeemed by His death,  glorified by His burial,  and currently held captive by Christ's enemies.  Urban II urges the audience to liberate Jerusalem,  suggesting it is their duty due to God's favor on them in arms.

Next,  I need to consider the context of the speech.  The speech is from the Council of Clermont in 1095 C.E.,  a time when Europe was facing threats from external forces,  such as the Seljuk Turks and the Byzantine Empire.  Urban II's call to arms is directed towards the Christian kingdoms of Europe to reclaim Jerusalem and the Holy Land from the Muslims.

Finally,  I need to match the context of the speech with the given choices.  The speech is focused on reclaiming Jerusalem and the Holy Land for Christianity,  not on pilgrimages to centers of religious significance,  eradication of heresies,  reconstruction of trade routes,  or developments in religious art.

 In fact,  the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this,  that the deed was done by a subject race â€” by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters,  and that of poor helpless ladies and children.  Here we had not only a servile war,  but we had a war of religion,  a war of race,  and a war of revenge,  of hope,  of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger,  and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs,  and the full sway of native religions.  Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt,  it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders,  as if by common instinct,  determined to effect their end was,  the destruction of every white man,  woman or child who fell into their hands.
 British journalist William Howard Russell,  My Indian Mutlny Diary,  1860
 Violence,  it must be emphasized,  was an essential component of the British presence in India.  A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it.  The right to violence is,  therefore,  everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly.  British rule in India,  as an autocracy,  had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence.  The revolt of 1857  shattered that monopoly by matching an official,  alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized.  The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin.  This was the condition of their domination,  of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races,  as civilized and uncivilized.  And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.

 From the perspective of the first passage,  the death of British citizens at Cawnpore Choices: a) seems to mark a betrayal of a ""higher"" race by a ""lesser"" race.  b) should be seen as a regrettable but avoidable mistake.  c) can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves.  d) was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key information from the first passage.  The passage describes the Cawnpore massacres as an aggravation where black men,  who were the subject race,  dared to shed the blood of their masters,  including poor helpless ladies and children.  The passage also mentions that the leaders of the mutiny determined to destroy every white man,  woman,  or child who fell into their hands.

Second,  I need to consider the choices given and see which one is supported by the information from the first passage.  Choice a) suggests that the death of British citizens at Cawnpore is seen as a betrayal by a ""lesser"" race.  This is supported by the passage,  which describes the mutineers as daring to act against their masters,  and the act of killing as a sign of revenge and an attempt to shake off the yoke of a stranger.

Choice b) states that the death should be seen as a regrettable but avoidable mistake.  This is not supported by the passage,  which does not imply that the massacres were avoidable or merely a mistake.

Choice c) suggests that the death can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves.  While the passage does mention the causes of the mutiny and the revolt,  it does not directly attribute the massacres to the British actions.

Choice d) claims that the death was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty.  The passage does not specifically mention religion as a motive for the massacres.

Choice d) The Chinese government abandoned Confucian principles to allow merchants a greater participation in local government,  is not mentioned in the text.

Based on the text,  the correct answer is not explicitly stated among the choices.  However,  the text does suggest that the Chinese government treated the Muslims favorably and allowed them to reside and practice their religion in Chinese provinces.  This could be interpreted as a form of endorsement for Muslim merchants to conduct trade within China.

 The Slave Trade
 All of you [soldiers],  are summoned .  .  .  to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""].  .  .  .  The soldiery divided themselves into two companies .  .  .  with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields.  .  .  .  Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes,  we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
 A Negro with beardâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦10  or 15,000  cowries.
 They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
 An adult Negressâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..10  or 15,000  cowries for the same reasons
 An adolescent Negroâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.30,000  cowries
 A young Negress â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦50 â€“60,000  cowries
 The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.

 A female Negro child â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.35 â€“40,000  cowries
 Finally,  our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons,  was now augmented by four hundred slaves,  of whom three hundred were women.  .  .  .  It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own.  .  .  .  Some rolled on the ground,  clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk.  .  .  .  They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.
 How was the Arab trade in Africans different from the Atlantic slave trade?  Choices: a) Unlike Arab slave merchants,  those involved in the Atlantic slave trade were motivated by religion.  b) Slaves taken for the Atlantic slave trade had no prospect of eventual liberty,  but slaves taken by Arab merchants did.  c) Slaves taken for the Atlantic trade were predominantly female; slaves taken by Arab merchants were mostly male.  d) Slaves taken by Arab merchants were likely to have a shorter life span than those taken for the Atlantic trade.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the information given in the passage about the Arab trade in Africans.  The passage describes how slaves were bought and sold in the market,  with prices varying based on age,  gender,  and beauty.  It also mentions that the caravan acquired four hundred slaves,  of whom three hundred were women.
 Next,  I need to consider the information about the Atlantic slave trade.  The passage does not explicitly mention any motivations for the slave trade,  so I cannot determine if those involved were motivated by religion.

 The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control,  they have been forced to pay yasak tribute.  Some have paid in sables,  others in red foxes,  still others in cash.  At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there,  but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands,  from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River.  Moreover,  almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses,  many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.

 Which of the following factors,  not mentioned in the second passage,  would have been most likely to create added difficulties for native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations?  Choices: a) The arrival of rival hunters from China and Japan b) The impact of epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers c) The general warming of the climate during this time period d) The reduced demand for furs among European and Asian elites 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the factors mentioned in the second passage that could create difficulties for native Siberians.  The passage mentions that the number of sables and red foxes has decreased,  making it harder to pay tribute in those forms.  It also mentions that many natives no longer have horses,  which would make hunting more difficult.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices that are not mentioned in the second passage.  Choices a),  b),  and d) are not mentioned in the passage.
 To determine which of these choices would have been most likely to create added difficulties,  I need to consider which choice would have the greatest impact on native Siberians.  Choice b),  the impact of epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers,  would have had a significant impact on native Siberians,  as it would reduce their population and make it harder for them to fulfill their tribute obligations.

 ""In Northern India the existence of separate States at this period is usually little more than a question of words.  A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence,  and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty,  the first step was to refuse,  or omit to pay revenue.  Such an omission might,  however,  arise from various other causes,  and it is probable that in Rajputana,  Central India,  and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position,  sometimes paying the stipulated revenue,  sometimes in open rebellion,  and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.

But,  on the other hand,  to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil.

 the heavy caliber slug

 bullet-in-the-back day
 Because it epitomized oppression
 and the nature of society
 More clearly than anything else;
 it was the classic event
 Nowhere is racial dominance

 Remember the dead

 What event symbolized the end of South Africa's institutionalized discrimination?  Choices: a) The election of F.  W.  de Klerk b) The election of Nelson Mandela c) The bombing of Lesotho d) The Boer War 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the event that symbolized the end of South Africa's institutionalized discrimination.  The poem by Dennis Brutus refers to Sharpeville,  South Africa,  in 1960,  which was a significant event in the struggle against apartheid,  but it does not directly answer the question.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices provided.  a) The election of F.  W.  de Klerk,  b) The election of Nelson Mandela,  c) The bombing of Lesotho,  and d) The Boer War.
 The Boer War was fought between 1899 and 1902,  and it was not the end of institutionalized discrimination.  So,  choice d) can be eliminated.
 The bombing of Lesotho was a separate event and not directly related to the end of institutionalized discrimination in South Africa.  So,  choice c) can be eliminated.
 Between choices a) and b),  the election of F.  W.  de Klerk and the election of Nelson Mandela,  both played significant roles in the end of apartheid in South Africa.  F.  W.  de Klerk was a key figure in the negotiations that led to the end of apartheid,  and Nelson Mandela was the symbol of the struggle against apartheid and the first black president of South Africa after the end of apartheid.

 a) The Spanish desire to convert the Barbary states to Catholicism is not relevant to the division of the New World.
 b) The Spanish belief that Portugal did not know about their discovery of the New World is not supported by historical evidence.
 c) The Spanish wanting to preserve the independence of Native states in the New World as a buffer against Portuguese expansion is consistent with the goal of the treaty to prevent conflict and maintain peace between the two powers.
 d) The Spanish thinking India would be harder to conquer than the New World is not relevant to the division of the New World.

 ""Upon their arrival they were honorably and graciously received by the grand Khan,  in a full assembly of his principal officers.  When they drew nigh to his person,  they paid their respects by prostrating themselves on the floor.  He immediately commanded them to rise,  and to relate to him the circumstances of their travels,  with all that had taken place in their negotiation with his holiness the pope.  To their narrative,  which they gave in the regular order of events,  and delivered in perspicuous language,  he listened with attentive silence.  The letters and the presents from pope Gregory were then laid before him,  and,  upon hearing the former read,  he bestowed much commendation on the fidelity,  the zeal,  and the diligence of his ambassadors; and receiving with due reverence the oil from the holy sepulchre,  he gave directions that it should be preserved with religious care.  Upon his observing Marco Polo,  and inquiring who he was,  Nicolo made answer,  This is your servant,  and my son; upon which the grand Khan replied,  ""He is welcome,  and it pleases me much, "" and he caused him to be enrolled amongst his attendants of honor.

 Alike from Rhine and Prague,
 And more than that-shame and dismay
 Your days and nights will plague.
 Right well you knew,  and all the world,
 Right well they know this thing,
 That Ferdinand alone can be
 Bohemia's lawful king.
 So come,  dear Fritz,  rouse up and go
 To Ferdinand,  your king,
 And beg him graciously to show
 Full pardon for your sin.

 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the main action of the Winter King in the song.  The song mentions that the Winter King ""snatched the kaiser's crown"" and that he will have to stay away from Rhine and Prague.  This indicates that the Winter King did something wrong and is now facing consequences.
 Next,  the song states that Ferdinand alone can be Bohemia's lawful king, and it suggests that Ferdinand should ask Ferdinand for pardon.  This implies that the Winter King's actions were against Ferdinand.
 Finally,  the song calls the Winter King's actions ""a very naughty thing,"" which suggests that the Winter King did something wrong.

 First,  I need to identify the treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies in the period 600 â€“1450  C. E.  that is similar to the treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies between 600  B. C.  and 600  C.  E.  in the given text.
 The text describes the Chamavi and Angrivarii driving the Tencteri out of their settlements and exterminating them.  It does not mention any conversion to religion,  utilization as soldiers,  servile status,  or ruling classes.
 However,  the text does mention that the neighboring tribes helped in the conflict against the Tencteri,  either out of hatred for the Tencteri or for plunder.  This suggests that the neighboring tribes had some form of interaction with the Tencteri,  which could be similar to the treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies in the period 600 â€“1450  C. E.
 Now,  I need to find the choice that matches this treatment.
 The choice that matches this treatment is b) Barbarian peoples were utilized as soldiers in their host societies.  This is because the neighboring tribes helped in the conflict against the Tencteri,  which could be seen as utilizing the barbarian peoples as soldiers in their host societies.

Choices: a) The conquest of India by rival Muslim empires b) The development of joint-stock companies c) The importation of food crops from the New World d) The African slave trade 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the instructions to boycott foreign cloth in the text.  The relevant paragraph is: ""I hope every Indian,  man or woman,  will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.""
 Next,  I need to consider the historical developments from the period 1450 â€“1750  C. E.  that could have inspired this instruction.  The choices are:
 a) The conquest of India by rival Muslim empires
 b) The development of joint-stock companies
 c) The importation of food crops from the New World
 d) The African slave trade

 The development of joint-stock companies,  option b,  is the most relevant to the instruction to boycott foreign cloth.  Joint-stock companies were responsible for the trade of foreign cloth in India,  which led to the decline of the indigenous textile industry.  This decline motivated the call to boycott foreign cloth and promote self-sufficiency in the production of cloth.

 That day the Reverend Xuanzang was chosen from among all the monks.  He had been a monk from infancy,  and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitions.  His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander,  Yin Kaishan.  His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library.  Xuanzang,  however,  had no interest in honour and glory,  and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana.  His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know.

 ""The quicksilver mines of Huancavelica are where the poor Indians are so harshly punished,  where they are tortured and so many Indians die; it is there that the noble caciques [headmen] of this kingdom are finished off and tortured.  The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]â€¦. The owners and stewards of the mines,  whether Spaniards,  mestizos,  or Indians,  are such tyrants,  with no fear of God or Justice,  because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a yearâ€¦.
 And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines.  The Indians,  under the pretext of mining chores,  are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains,  and the Indians die.  These Indians are not paid for their labor,  and their work is kept hidden.
 And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubinesâ€¦. And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]â€¦at their own expense,  and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays.  In this way,  the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt,  and they have no way to pay their tribute.
 There is no remedy for all this,  because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners,  and all the owners join forces in bribing himâ€¦. Even the protector of the Indians is useless;â€¦he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians. ""

Choices: a) The prosecution of a variety of wars by the Spanish Hapsburgs across the world b) The development of a vibrant merchant class in Spain c) A decrease in patronage of religious activities by the monarchs of Spain d) A decrease in the frequency of voyages of exploration undertaken by the Spanish 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the main topic of the passage,  which is the harsh working conditions and exploitation of the poor Indians in the quicksilver mines of Huancavelica and other silver mines.
 Next,  I need to consider the time period mentioned,  which is 1450 â€“1750  C. E.,  and how the production of these mines could have affected the options given.
 The passage does not mention any wars or the Spanish Hapsburgs,  so option a) can be eliminated.
 The passage does not mention any development of a vibrant merchant class in Spain,  so option b) can be eliminated.
 The passage does not mention any decrease in patronage of religious activities by the monarchs of Spain,  so option c) can be eliminated.
 The passage does not directly mention voyages of exploration,  but the exploitation of the mines would likely lead to a decrease in the resources available for such voyages,  as the wealth generated by the mines would be used for the benefit of the mine owners and the Spanish crown rather than for exploration.

 Questions to the passage below,  an account given to a French officer in Algeria in the 1830 s by a member of an Arab slave trade caravan.
 The Slave Trade
 All of you [soldiers],  are summoned .  .  .  to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""].  .  .  .  The soldiery divided themselves into two companies .  .  .  with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields.  .  .  .  Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes,  we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
 A Negro with beardâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦10  or 15,000  cowries.
 They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
 An adult Negressâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..10  or 15,000  cowries for the same reasons
 An adolescent Negroâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.30,000  cowries
 A young Negress â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦50 â€“60,000  cowries
 The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
 A male Negro childâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..45,000  cowries
 A female Negro child â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.35 â€“40,000  cowries
 Finally,  our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons,  was now augmented by four hundred slaves,  of whom three hundred were women.  .  .  .  It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own.  .  .  .  Some rolled on the ground,  clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk.  .  .  .  They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.
 Which conclusion is supported by the passage?  Choices: a) Africans passively accepted their capture and subsequent enslavement.  b) North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes.  c) Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women.  d) Adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze the passage and identify the key information.  The passage describes an account of an Arab slave trade caravan in the 1830s,  and it provides details about the slave trade,  including the prices for different types of slaves and the number of slaves captured.
 Next,  I need to consider the given choices and see which one is supported by the passage.  Choice a) suggests that Africans accepted their capture passively,  but the passage mentions that some slaves ""absolutely refused to walk"" and had to be forced to continue.  This contradicts the idea that they accepted their capture passively.
 Choice b) suggests that North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes,  but the passage does not mention any rivalry between African tribes.  It only describes the caravan capturing people without mentioning any tribes.
 Choice c) suggests that North African tribes had more men than women after the slave trade,  but the passage does not provide any information about the gender distribution in North African tribes before or after the slave trade.
 Choice d) suggests that adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength,  and this is supported by the passage.  The passage states that an adult Negro was priced at 10 or 15,000 cowries,  which is higher than the price for an adult Negress (10 or15,000 cowries).  This indicates that adult male slaves were more highly valued than adult female slaves.

 Oh,  shame on you,  poor Winter King!
 What's this that you have done?
 Is 't not a very naughty thing
 To snatch the kaiser's crown?
 Now you will have to stay away
 Alike from Rhine and Prague,
 And more than that-shame and dismay
 Your days and nights will plague.
 Right well you knew,  and all the world,
 Right well they know this thing,
 That Ferdinand alone can be
 Bohemia's lawful king.
 So come,  dear Fritz,  rouse up and go
 To Ferdinand,  your king,
 And beg him graciously to show
 Full pardon for your sin.
 ""Poor Winter King, "" seventeenth-century song
 Which of the following best explains why the narrator mentions ""Rhine and Prague""?  Choices: a) They are destinations for the Winter King's planned pilgrimage.  b) These are lands that the Winter King lost in battle.  c) Because these were strongholds of the Holy Roman Empire,  the narrator warns the Winter King to stay away.  d) They are significant military posts within the borders of the Holy Roman Empire.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the poem.  The poem is a seventeenth-century song about the Winter King,  a title once held by the King of Bohemia.  The Winter King has snatched the kaiser's crown from Ferdinand,  who is the rightful king of Bohemia.  The narrator is chiding the Winter King for his actions.
 Next,  I need to identify the specific line that mentions ""Rhine and Prague"": ""Now you will have to stay away / Alike from Rhine and Prague.""
 The line suggests that the Winter King is to avoid these two places as a consequence of his actions.  The poem is written in the context of the Holy Roman Empire,  a political entity that included Bohemia,  Rhine,  and Prague.
 Now,  I need to consider the given choices and determine which one best explains the mention of ""Rhine and Prague.""
 a) They are destinations for the Winter King's planned pilgrimage. - This choice does not explain why the Winter King is to stay away from these places.
 b) These are lands that the Winter King lost in battle. - There is no mention of battle in the poem,  so this choice is not supported by the text.
 c) Because these were strongholds of the Holy Roman Empire,  the narrator warns the Winter King to stay away. - This choice aligns with the context of the poem and the political situation within the Holy Roman Empire.
 d) They are significant military posts within the borders of the Holy Roman Empire. - While this choice is true,  it does not explain why the Winter King is to stay away from these places.

a) Intervention by the United States and European powers in the independence of Latin American countries - This could potentially threaten the newly formed Republic of Colombia,  but it doesn't directly undermine the expectation of the provinces uniting to strengthen their own sovereignty.

b) Nationalism in Latin America pressing for stronger unity between the former Spanish colonies of South America - This choice directly undermines the expectation expressed in Article 1  of Source 1.  It suggests that there is a push for a stronger unity between the former Spanish colonies,  which is the opposite of the idea presented in the text that separate republics would hardly consolidate and make respect their sovereignty.

c) Slave rebellions fragmenting newly independent Latin American states - This choice could cause internal problems in the states but doesn't directly undermine the expectation of the provinces uniting to strengthen their own sovereignty.

d) Sectionalism of elites in the various territories of newly independent Latin American states - This choice could lead to internal divisions within the newly formed Republic of Colombia,  but it doesn't directly undermine the expectation of the provinces uniting to strengthen their own sovereignty.

 ""Medicine considers the human body as to the means by which it is cured and by which it is driven away from health.  The knowledge of anything,  since all things have causes,  is not acquired or complete unless it is known by its causes.  Therefore in medicine we ought to know the causes of sickness and health.  And because health and sickness and their causes are sometimes manifest,  and sometimes hidden and not to be comprehended except by the study of symptoms,  we must also study the symptoms of health and disease.  Now it is established in the sciences that no knowledge is acquired save through the study of its causes and beginnings,  if it has had causes and beginnings; nor completed except by knowledge of its accidents and accompanying essentials.

 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the sources of the passages.  Source 1 is from Paul of Aegina,  a Greek physician from the late seventh century C. E.,  and Source 2 is from Ibn Sina (Avicenna),  an Islamic polymath from the 11th century C. E.
 Next,  I need to analyze the content of the passages.  Both passages discuss the importance of understanding the causes of health and disease,  and the study of symptoms in medicine.  Source 1 provides a specific example of a medical procedure for treating a fractured thigh,  while Source 2 discusses the broader concept of understanding the causes of sickness and health.
 Finally,  I need to consider the cultural exchanges that occurred in the period 600 â€“1450  C. E.  The correct answer is d) The influence of Greek science on Europeans through Byzantine and Islamic scholars.  Both passages demonstrate the influence of Greek science on European (in this case,  Islamic) medicine,  with the emphasis on understanding the causes of health and disease and the study of symptoms.  The specific medical procedure described in Source 1 would have been learned from Greek medical texts,  and the broader philosophical approach to medicine in Source 2 reflects the Greek emphasis on understanding the causes of natural phenomena.

 Second,  I need to consider the choices provided and see which one aligns with the historical context of Russia's efforts to modernize and become more powerful.  The Space Race with the United States is a period of competition between the Soviet Union (Russia under Stalin) and the United States, which could be seen as a way for both countries to assert their dominance and avoid being beaten again.

 Third,  I need to eliminate the other choices that do not fit the context of Stalin's speech.  The Polish-Soviet War in the early 1920s was a conflict between the Soviet Union and Poland, which was not mentioned in Stalin's speech as a reason for Russia's backwardness.  The Western intervention in the Russian Civil War was a period when various countries supported different factions in the Russian Civil War, which was not directly related to Russia's backwardness or the need to modernize.  The German invasion of Russia in 1941 was a military conflict that occurred after Stalin's speech, and it was not mentioned in his speech as a reason for Russia's backwardness.

 Which of the following religious movements was ideologically opposed to the sentiments about the use of holy images reflected in the passages?  Choices: a) Sunni Islam b) Buddhism c) Zoroastrianism d) Jainism 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the sentiments expressed in the passages.  Source 1 praises the use of images as a way to bring understanding to the illiterate and as a memorial of the incarnation of the Word of God.  Source 2 also supports the use of images,  stating that they are a useful tradition in the preaching of the Gospel and have mutual significations with the incarnation of the Word of God.
 Next,  I need to consider the religious movements given as choices and their attitudes towards images.  Sunni Islam generally allows for the use of images,  as long as they are not considered to be idolatry.  Buddhism generally discourages the use of images,  as it is believed that attachment to images can lead to spiritual stagnation.  Zoroastrianism does not have a strong stance on the use of images,  as it is more focused on the teachings of the Avesta.  Jainism also discourages the use of images,  as it is considered to be a form of idolatry.
 Comparing the sentiments in the passages with the choices,  I can see that the religious movement ideologically opposed to the sentiments about the use of holy images reflected in the passages is b) Buddhism.

 Excerpt from the inscription of Kerdir at Naqsh-e-Rustam,  Persia,  late third century C. E.
 Which of the following best explains the presence of Buddhist communities within Sassanid Persia?  Choices: a) Persian efforts to convert people away from Buddhism inspired further followers.  b) Buddhism's apocalyptic message swayed converts in Persia.  c) Persia's location sat astride international trade routes with India.  d) Buddhists were granted limited toleration by Zoroastrians.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the historical context of Sassanian Persia.  The Sassanian Empire was a Zoroastrian state that existed from the late 3rd to the early 7th century C.E.,  and it was known for its religious tolerance.  The excerpt from Kerdir's inscription mentions the establishment of many Warham (or Warharan) fires, which were fire temples dedicated to the worship of Ahura Mazda, the supreme deity of Zoroastrianism.

Next,  I need to consider the options provided.  Option a) suggests that Persian efforts to convert people away from Buddhism led to more followers,  but the text does not mention any efforts to convert people away from Buddhism.  Option b) mentions the apocalyptic message of Buddhism,  but there is no evidence in the text that this message was a factor in the presence of Buddhist communities.  Option c) discusses the location of Persia,  which was indeed a crossroads of international trade routes,  but this does not directly explain the presence of Buddhist communities within the Sassanian Empire.  Option d) suggests that Buddhists were granted limited toleration by Zoroastrians,  which is consistent with the historical context of Sassanian Persia,  as the empire was known for its religious tolerance.

 Treaty of Tordesillas,  1494
 Which of the following technologies most directly caused the treaty above to be signed?  Choices: a) Gunpowder weapons b) The compass c) Steel d) Germ Theory 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the historical context of the Treaty of Tordesillas.  This treaty was signed in 1494 between Spain and Portugal,  as both countries were competing for territories and resources in the newly discovered lands.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  Gunpowder weapons were already in use by the time of the treaty,  but they did not directly cause the treaty to be signed.  The compass was used for navigation,  but it was not the primary factor that led to the treaty.  Steel was used in weapons and armor,  but it was not the direct cause of the treaty.  Germ theory,  on the other hand,  was not a significant factor in the 15th century.

 ""The question as to who,  and what,  is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels.  Firstly,  the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent.  Secondly,  one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system.  The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa. ""
 Walter Rodney,  historian,  How Europe Underdeveloped Africa,  1974
 Based on your knowledge of world history,  which of the following contributed LEAST to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa in the period 1750  to 1900  C. E.?  Choices: a) The invention of the machine gun b) The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases c) The development of the joint-stock company d) The invention of steam-powered ships 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the time period mentioned,  which is from 1750  to 1900  C.E.,  a time when European powers were actively colonizing Africa.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the impact of each choice on Europe's ability to penetrate Africa during this period.
 The invention of the machine gun (a) would have been a significant factor in the success of European military campaigns,  as it allowed for greater firepower and control over African forces.
 The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases (b) would have been crucial for the survival of European colonizers in the harsh African environment,  allowing them to maintain a larger and healthier workforce.
 The development of the joint-stock company (c) would have been important for organizing and financing the colonization efforts,  but it was more of an organizational tool rather than a direct factor in the military or logistical penetration of Africa.
 The invention of steam-powered ships (d) would have been essential for the transportation of troops,  goods,  and resources across the vast distances of the African continent.
 Comparing the impact of each choice,  I would say that the development of the joint-stock company (c) contributed least to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa during this period,  as it was more of an organizational tool rather than a direct factor in the military or logistical penetration of Africa.

 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key points in the speech.  The speaker argues that a Union of African states will command respect from the world,  due to its size and influence.  He also mentions that the scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara,  and the ignominious spectacle of the U. N.  in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy,  are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  The French saw Africa as a) A collection of republics tottering into anarchy,  b) A resource for enhancing French power in the Cold War,  c) Important due to the Sahara's natural resources,  or d) A strong political union.
 Based on the speech,  the French saw Africa as a collection of republics that were not united and were falling into anarchy.  This corresponds to choice a) A collection of republics tottering into anarchy.

 First,  I need to consider the context and the type of experiences Ibn Battuta had in 'Aden.  He describes the city as a port of trade,  with merchants,  porters,  and fishermen,  and interactions with Indian,  Egyptian,  and other foreign merchants.
 Next,  I need to consider the experiences of the other individuals mentioned:
 a) Zheng He was a Chinese explorer who led several maritime expeditions during the early Ming Dynasty.
 b) Marco Polo was a Venetian merchant and explorer who traveled through Asia during the late 13th century.
 c) Lorenzo de Medici was an Italian merchant,  banker,  and political figure who was a prominent member of the Medici family.
 d) Xuanzang was a Chinese Buddhist monk and traveler who traveled to India to obtain Buddhist scriptures.

Comparing the experiences of these individuals to Ibn Battuta's,  it is clear that c) Lorenzo de Medici had the LEAST similar experiences,  as he was a merchant and political figure in Italy,  not involved in maritime trade like Ibn Battuta.

 ""Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighboring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves.  Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy.  If we look to the laws,  they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing,  advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity,  class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way,  if a man is able to serve the state,  he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition.  The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life.  There,  far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other,  we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes,  or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive,  although they inflict no positive penalty.

 First,  I need to identify the relevant information in the passage that relates to the geography of Greece and its impact on the dissemination of Greek culture.  The passage does not discuss natural resources,  freshwater lakes,  or prominent river valleys.  However,  it mentions that Greece has many natural harbors.
 Next,  I need to consider how the presence of many natural harbors could have facilitated trade and commerce,  and thus the dissemination of Greek culture.  Natural harbors would allow Greek ships to easily access the sea,  facilitating trade with other regions.

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the historical and political context of The Prince,  written by Nicolo Machiavelli in the early 16th century.  The text is set during a period of intense political conflict in Italy,  with various city-states and factions vying for power and influence.
 Next,  I need to look at the content of the treatise itself.  Machiavelli discusses the qualities of a successful ruler and the importance of being feared rather than loved,  due to the fickleness and ungratefulness of subjects.  He also emphasizes the need for a ruler to be prepared for betrayal and to rely on fear as a means of maintaining control.

In the first passage,  Olympe de Gouges discusses the rights of women and the enslaved man,  emphasizing the need for equality and justice.  In the second passage,  Halima Ghomri talks about the aftermath of Algeria's war of independence,  expressing disappointment with the lack of improvements in her life and her children's education.

Next,  I need to consider the choices given and see which one can be most reasonably made based on the information provided.  Choice a) focuses on the value of the liberties gained,  but neither passage explicitly discusses the value of the bloodshed.  Choice b) mentions the failure to benefit women or ethnic minorities,  but the first passage is about women specifically,  while the second passage does not mention ethnicity.  Choice c) discusses the unequal or inconsistent distribution of liberties,  which can be inferred from both passages,  as Olympe de Gouges calls for the enslaved man to become just to his companion, and Halima Ghomri expresses disappointment with no significant changes in her life.  Choice d) focuses on the lack of economic improvement,  which can be seen in Halima Ghomri's account,  but it does not address the issue of unequal distribution of liberties.

 First,  I need to identify the key points in the passage that relate to the choices provided.  The passage mentions ""Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and,  more important,  by geographical and ecological luck."" This suggests that Crosby is discussing an event where Western Europe exerted its power over other regions through force and luck.
 Next,  I need to consider each choice in relation to the passage.  a) The development of direct trade links between Western Europe and India does not mention the use of force or luck, so it is not the correct answer.  b) The beginning of the Industrial Revolution is not mentioned in the passage, so it is not the correct answer.  d) The increasing development of seafaring technologies is not specifically mentioned in the passage, so it is not the correct answer.
 c) The colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans matches the key points in the passage, mentioning force, luck, and Western Europe exerting its power over other regions.

"Input: This question refers to the following information.
 Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati,  the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility.  To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end,  when the power exists of preventing it,  is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror.  But,  on the other hand,  to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil.  When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security,  expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding,  but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.
 William Bentinck,  Govenor-General of India,  ""On the Suppression of Sati, "" 1829
 I have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us],  and however repugnant it may be to our feelings,  I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron,  to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination,  and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].
 George Simpson,  Head of Northern Department,  Hudson's Bay Company,  1826
 The passages above are best understood in the context of which of the following practices?  Choices: a) Legalization of slavery in overseas colonies b) Exercise of colonial administrative power over native peoples c) Western missionary efforts in colonized territories d) Mobilization of military resources from colonial possessions 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the key themes in both passages.  In the first passage,  the author discusses the practice of sati and the dilemma of whether to continue or discontinue it,  while considering the safety of the British Empire in India.
 In the second passage,  the author discusses the need to rule the Indians with a rod of iron and the importance of letting them feel their dependence on European goods.
 Both passages discuss the relationship between European powers and native peoples in colonial contexts,  with a focus on controlling and subordinating the native populations.

 North Atlantic Treaty,  April 4,  1949
 The treaty above is most clearly an example of which of the following?  Choices: a) A reduction of barriers to trade across international borders b) A secret treaty to maintain the balance of power in Europe c) Reconstruction efforts to rebuild Europe after World War II d) A response to aggression from outside of Western Europe 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the main purpose of the treaty.  The treaty is about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),  which was established in 1949.
 Next,  I need to look at the key provisions of the treaty.

The Green Revolution refers to a period of agricultural development,  but it does not specifically mention the introduction of plants from one continent to another.  The Columbian Exchange refers to the transfer of plants,  animals,  and diseases between the Americas and the Old World.  The triangular trade involved the exchange of goods and slaves between Europe,  Africa,  and the Americas.  The Middle Passage refers to the journey of enslaved Africans to the Americas.
 Finally,  I need to determine which process matches the key elements.  The introduction of plants from Eurasasia and Africa to the Americas by invaders is best described by the process of the Columbian Exchange.

 ""The greatest contribution that Africa can make to the peace of the world is to avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity,  by creating a political union which will also by its success,  stand as an example to a divided world.  A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality.  It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence.  The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara,  and the ignominious spectacle of the U.

 Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs.  China
 In Western Europe during the 1200 s through the 1400 s,  early cannons,  as heavy and as slow to fire as they were,  proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move.  By contrast,  China,  especially after the mid-1300 s,  was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads,  against whom early gunpowder weapons,  with their unwieldiness,  proved of little utility.  It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
 What traditional view of world history does this passage seem to challenge?  Choices: a) That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies b) That China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation c) That China was hindered by religious fundamentalism when it came to modernizing efforts d) That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze the information given in the passage.  The passage states that Western Europe invested in the development of gunpowder weapons during the 1200 s through the 1400 s because they were useful in the warfare of the time.  In contrast,  China focused on improving horse archer units,  as early gunpowder weapons were not effective against the mobile nomads that threatened the country.
 Now,  I need to consider the choices given and see which one is challenged by the passage.  Choice a) suggests that China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies,  but the passage shows that China made advancements in technology during the 1200 s and 1300 s,  just in a different area than Europe.
 Choice b) states that China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation,  but the passage does not mention anything about China's political system hindering technological innovation.
 Choice c) claims that China was hindered by religious fundamentalism when it came to modernizing efforts,  but the passage does not mention any religious factors affecting China's technological advancements.
 Choice d) suggests that China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change,  which is supported by the passage as it describes how Europe focused on developing gunpowder weapons while China focused on improving horse archer units.

 Which type of organization was partially responsible for improving the hours,  wages,  and working conditions of workers in this era?  Choices: a) Guilds b) Joint-stock companies c) Labor unions d) Zaibatsu groups 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the time period and context of the passage.  The passage is from the testimony before Parliament during the Sadler Committee investigation in 1831-32,  which was focused on child labor and working conditions.
 Next,  I need to consider the types of organizations mentioned as potential answers:
 a) Guilds - These were associations of craftsmen and merchants in the Middle Ages, not relevant to the 19th century.
 b) Joint-stock companies - These were companies where shares were issued to the public, but they were more focused on profit and less on improving working conditions.
 c) Labor unions - These are organizations that represent workers' interests in negotiating better wages, hours, and working conditions.
 d) Zaibatsu groups - These were Japanese banking and trading conglomerates in the 20th century, not relevant to the 19th century.

Considering the context of the passage and the time period, the most likely organization responsible for improving the hours, wages, and working conditions of workers in this era would be a labor union.
