"Input: What is the term for a sub-optimal but acceptable outcome of negotiations between parties?  Choices: a) Bargaining b) Satisficing c) Accepting d) Compromising 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the term being asked for.  The term refers to a situation where parties reach a solution that is not the best possible but is still acceptable.
 Next,  I can eliminate options that do not fit the description.  Bargaining typically refers to the process of negotiation,  not the outcome.  Accepting is a passive action,  not an active negotiation process.  Compromising involves both parties giving up something to reach an agreement,  which can lead to a sub-optimal but acceptable outcome.
 Satisficing is the term that best fits the description,  as it involves finding a solution that meets a certain threshold of acceptability,  even if it is not the best possible outcome.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

Face-to-face communication is the richest in terms of non-verbal cues,  but it is limited by physical proximity.  E-mail is the least rich in non-verbal cues,  as it is text-based and lacks real-time interaction.  Video conference combines elements of both telephone and face-to-face communication,  allowing for some non-verbal cues while maintaining a level of distance.

Considering the richness of non-verbal cues,  face-to-face communication is the richest form of information.  However,  it is not always feasible due to physical distance.  Video conference is the next richest,  as it allows for some non-verbal cues while maintaining a level of distance.  Telephone and e-mail are the least rich in non-verbal cues.

Therefore,  the richest form of information is {'sol': 'b'}"

"Input: What is the optimal span of control?  Choices: a) 2  b) 5  c) 7  d) None of the above 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what optimal span of control means.  Span of control refers to the number of subordinates a manager can effectively supervise and direct.  The optimal span of control is the ideal number of subordinates that a manager can effectively manage.
 Next,  I consider the factors that affect the optimal span of control,  such as the skills of the manager,  the skills of the subordinates,  the nature of the work,  and the communication channels.
 In general,  a smaller span of control (fewer subordinates per manager) is more effective for tasks that require close supervision and coordination.  However,  a larger span of control can be more efficient for tasks that are routine and require less direct supervision.
 Considering these factors,  there is no one-size-fits-all answer to the optimal span of control.  It depends on the specific context and circumstances.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

 Output:
 First,  we need to identify the overriding philosophy that guides an organization's strategic direction. This philosophy is typically found in a document that outlines the organization's purpose, goals, and values.
 Next,  we can eliminate options that are not directly related to the strategic direction. A vision statement is a statement of what an organization aspires to be in the future, which is related but not the overriding philosophy. A strategy statement is a plan of action to achieve specific goals, which is also related but not the overriding philosophy. A business statement is a general description of the organization, which is not the overriding philosophy.
