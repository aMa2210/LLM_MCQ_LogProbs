"Input: What size of cannula would you use in a patient who needed a rapid blood transfusion (as of 2020  medical knowledge)?  Choices: a) 18  gauge.  b) 20  gauge.  c) 22  gauge.  d) 24  gauge.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the purpose of the cannula and the need for rapid blood transfusion.  Rapid blood transfusion requires a larger diameter to ensure a higher flow rate.
 Next,  I will consider the gauge size.  The smaller the gauge number,  the larger the internal diameter of the cannula.
 Comparing the options,  20  gauge is larger than 22  gauge and 24  gauge,  and slightly smaller than 18  gauge.
 Therefore,  for a rapid blood transfusion,  I would choose a 20  gauge cannula.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: The key attribute in successful marathon running is: Choices: a) strength.  b) power.  c) stride length.  d) stamina.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider what makes a marathon runner successful.  A marathon is a long-distance race that requires endurance and the ability to maintain a consistent pace over a long period.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice in relation to the marathon.  Strength,  power,  and stride length are all important factors in running,  but they do not necessarily contribute to success in a marathon.  Strength and power are important for acceleration and overcoming resistance,  but they do not guarantee a consistent pace over a long distance.  Stride length is important for efficiency,  but it does not directly contribute to endurance.
 Stamina,  on the other hand,  is the ability to sustain physical effort over an extended period.  It is a key factor in maintaining a consistent pace and finishing a marathon.  Without stamina,  a runner would not be able to sustain their effort and would likely drop out of the race.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following is the commonest cause of dementia in the UK?  Choices: a) Alzheimer's disease.  b) Cerebrovascular (stroke) disease.  c) Lewy body dementia.  d) HIV infection.  
 Output:
 First, I need to consider the prevalence of each cause of dementia in the UK. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia worldwide, and this is also true in the UK. Cerebrovascular disease is a significant cause of dementia but not the most common. Lewy body dementia is another common cause but not the most common. HIV infection is extremely rare as a cause of dementia in the UK.

Based on the prevalence of each cause, the commonest cause of dementia in the UK is Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following is NOT a symptom of anaphylaxis?  Choices: a) Stridor.  b) Bradycardia.  c) Severe wheeze.  d) Rash.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what anaphylaxis is.  Anaphylaxis is a severe,  rapid onset allergic reaction that can cause difficulty breathing,  low blood pressure,  and shock.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice in the context of anaphylaxis symptoms.  Stridor (a) is a high-pitched sound made by the flow of air through the narrowed portion of the airway,  which can be a symptom of anaphylaxis.  Bradycardia (b) is a slow heart rate,  which is not a typical symptom of anaphylaxis.  Severe wheeze (c) is a high-pitched whistling sound made by air passing through narrowed airways,  which can be a symptom of anaphylaxis.  Rash (d) is a change in the skin's appearance,  which can be a symptom of anaphylaxis.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: In what situation are closed pouches applied?  Choices: a) The patient has a semi-formed or liquid output.  b) The patient has a colostomy.  c) In the immediate post-operative period.  d) The patient has a urostomy.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what closed pouches are.  Closed pouches are used to collect semi-formed or liquid waste from the body,  such as feces or urine.
 Next,  I need to consider each choice and determine if it is a situation where closed pouches would be applied.
 a) The patient has a semi-formed or liquid output - This is a situation where closed pouches are used,  as they are designed to collect semi-formed or liquid waste.
 b) The patient has a colostomy - A colostomy is a surgical procedure where a opening,  or stoma,  is created on the abdomen to collect feces from the large intestine.  Closed pouches are not typically used in this situation,  as the feces is collected directly from the stoma.
 c) In the immediate post-operative period - This is a situation where closed pouches may be used,  especially if the patient is not yet producing semi-formed or liquid waste.
 d) The patient has a urostomy - A urostomy is a surgical procedure where an opening,  or stoma,  is created on the abdomen to collect urine from the urinary system.  Closed pouches are not typically used in this situation,  as the urine is collected directly from the stoma.

Based on the analysis,  the situations where closed pouches are applied are a) The patient has a semi-formed or liquid output and c) In the immediate post-operative period.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'ac'}"
"Input: With an increasing number of sprints the: Choices: a) anaerobic contribution progressively increases.  b) pH of the muscle falls below 6.0.  c) blood glucose concentration falls below 3  mmol/L.  d) relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases.  
 Output:
 First, let's consider the concept of sprints. Sprints are high-intensity exercises that require a balance between anaerobic and aerobic metabolism. As the number of sprints increases, the body needs to maintain performance, which means it needs to efficiently use both types of metabolism.

Next, let's analyze each choice:
a) Anaerobic contribution progressively increases: This choice suggests that as sprints increase, the body relies more on anaerobic metabolism. However, this could lead to quicker fatigue and decreased performance since anaerobic energy sources are limited.

b) pH of the muscle falls below 6.0: This choice refers to a physiological change in the muscle. While intense exercise can cause temporary changes in muscle pH, the statement is too specific and not directly related to the increasing number of sprints.

c) Blood glucose concentration falls below 3 mmol/L: This choice is related to the body's energy reserves. As sprints increase, the body would indeed use up its glucose stores, but this choice does not directly address the metabolic changes associated with the increasing number of sprints.

d) Relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases: This choice suggests that as the number of sprints increases, the body relies more on aerobic metabolism to maintain performance. This is a plausible answer because aerobic metabolism provides a more sustainable source of energy and can help prevent the rapid depletion of anaerobic energy sources.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true in diplopia?  Choices: a) Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered b) The outer image is always the false image c) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards d) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint 
 Output:
 First, let's analyze each option:
 a) Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered - This statement is not true because if one eye is covered, the other eye will still be able to see, and there will be no diplopia.
 b) The outer image is always the false image - This statement is not true because in diplopia, the outer image is usually the true image, and the inner image is the false one.
 c) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards - This statement is not true because a fourth nerve palsy is caused by pressure on the optic nerve, not by looking upwards.
 d) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint - This statement is true because a sixth nerve palsy can affect the muscles controlling eye movements, leading to a divergent squint.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Sodium bicarbonate ingestion improves middle distance running performance by: Choices: a) elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.  b) reducing the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.  c) elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster influx of hydrogen ions into muscle.  d) elevating the pre-exercise muscle pH.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the effect of sodium bicarbonate on the body.  Sodium bicarbonate ingestion increases the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid.
 Next,  I need to consider how this change affects the efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.  An increase in pH and buffering capacity means that there is a greater capacity to neutralize hydrogen ions.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Codons are composed of: Choices: a) triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA .  b) quadruplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA.  c) triplet sequences of amino acids in polypeptide chains.  d) triplet sequences of deoxyribose sugars in DNA.  
 Output:
 First, I need to understand what codons are. Codons are the units of the genetic code that determine the sequence of amino acids in a protein.
 Next, I need to consider the structure of a codon. A codon consists of three nucleotide bases.
 Now, I can compare the given choices with the information I have. Choice a) states that codons are triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA, which matches the information I have.
 Choice b) states that codons are quadruplet sequences of nucleotide bases, which is incorrect because codons consist of three nucleotide bases.
 Choice c) states that codons are triplet sequences of amino acids, which is incorrect because codons determine the sequence of amino acids, but they themselves are not sequences of amino acids.
 Choice d) states that codons are triplet sequences of deoxyribose sugars, which is incorrect because codons are composed of nucleotide bases, not deoxyribose sugars.
 Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria bound to: Choices: a) thiokinase.  b) coenzyme A (CoA).  c) acetyl-CoA.  d) carnitine.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the role of fatty acids in the mitochondria.  Fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria to be oxidized in a process called beta-oxidation.
 Next,  I need to identify the molecule that facilitates this transport.  Carnitine plays a crucial role in this process by helping to transport long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the answers below best indicates the compatible blood types that can be given to a person with a blood group B (rhesus negative)?  Choices: a) Blood type AB (rhesus negative),  blood type B,  and blood type O (rhesus negative).  b) Blood type B (rhesus positive) and blood type O (rhesus positive).  c) Blood type B (rhesus negative) and blood type O (rhesus negative).  d) Blood type B (rhesus negative) only.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the rhesus factor.  The person has a rhesus negative blood group,  so the blood type that can be given must also be rhesus negative.  This eliminates choices b) and d).
 Next,  I need to consider the blood group.  The person has a blood group B,  so the blood type that can be given must either be B or O,  since these are the compatible blood types for group B.  This eliminates choice c).
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true of a lower motor neurone lesion in the arm?  Choices: a) It leads to increased tone in the arm (hypertonia) b) Fasciculations are never seen c) The reflexes are brisk d) An ulna nerve palsy is an example of a lower motor neurone lesion 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the characteristics of a lower motor neurone lesion.  A lower motor neurone lesion is caused by damage to the nerve fibers that carry signals from the brain to the muscles,  resulting in muscle weakness.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice based on this understanding.  a) Increased tone in the arm (hypertonia) is not characteristic of a lower motor neurone lesion,  as it refers to increased muscle stiffness,  which is more associated with upper motor neurone lesions.
 b) Fasciculations are seen in some cases of lower motor neurone lesions,  as they are involuntary muscle contractions,  so this choice is not true.
 c) The reflexes are brisk in a lower motor neurone lesion,  as the reflexes are generated by the brain and are not affected by the lesion.
 d) An ulna nerve palsy is an example of a lower motor neurone lesion,  as it is a condition where the nerve supplying the forearm muscles is damaged,  resulting in muscle weakness.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following statements is false?  Choices: a) Ammonia is produced in repeated high intensity exercise.  b) Muscle lactate accumulation does not begin until at least 5  seconds of intermittent muscle contractions have taken place.  c) Muscle phosphocreatine depletion begins in the first few seconds of high intensity exercise.  d) With an increasing number of repeated sprints the rate of accumulation of lactate in muscle declines.  
 Output:
 First,  I will go through each statement and evaluate its truthfulness.
 a) Ammonia is produced in repeated high intensity exercise.  This statement is true.  During high intensity exercise,  the body produces ammonia as a byproduct of protein breakdown and other metabolic processes.
 b) Muscle lactate accumulation does not begin until at least 5  seconds of intermittent muscle contractions have taken place.  This statement is false.  Lactate begins to accumulate in muscles even during the first few seconds of exercise,  as the body starts to use anaerobic metabolism to generate energy.
 c) Muscle phosphocreatine depletion begins in the first few seconds of high intensity exercise.  This statement is true.  Phosphocreatine stores are used rapidly during the first few seconds of high intensity exercise,  providing an immediate source of energy.
 d) With an increasing number of repeated sprints the rate of accumulation of lactate in muscle declines.  This statement is true.  As the body adapts to repeated sprints,  the rate of lactate accumulation in muscles decreases,  improving the ability to tolerate high-intensity exercise.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Glycogen breakdown in muscle initially results in the formation of: Choices: a) glucose.  b) glucose-1 -phosphate.  c) glucose-6 -phosphate.  d) glucose-1,6 -diphosphate.  
 Output:
 First,  glycogen breakdown in muscle involves the hydrolysis of glycogen molecules into their monomer units,  which are glucose molecules.
 Next,  the newly formed glucose molecules are immediately phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase.
 Finally,  the glucose-6-phosphate can be further metabolized or converted into other molecules depending on the cell's needs.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The two principal contractile proteins found in skeletal muscle are: Choices: a) actin and troponin.  b) actin and myosin.  c) troponin and tropomyosin.  d) myosin and tropomyosin.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the two principal contractile proteins in skeletal muscle.  Contractile proteins are responsible for muscle contraction.
 Next,  I will evaluate the choices given:
 a) actin and troponin - Troponin is not a contractile protein,  it regulates muscle contraction by interacting with tropomyosin.
 b) actin and myosin - Actin and myosin are both contractile proteins that interact to generate muscle contraction.
 c) troponin and tropomyosin - Troponin is not a contractile protein,  as mentioned before.
 d) myosin and tropomyosin - Tropomyosin is not a contractile protein,  it regulates muscle contraction by interacting with troponin.

Based on the evaluation,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which one of the following represents a IIIrd cranial nerve palsy and is a neurosurgical emergency?  Choices: a) Unilateral constricted pupil.  b) Bilateral constricted pupils.  c) Unilateral fixed dilated pupil.  d) Oval shaped pupils.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the cranial nerve III,  which is also known as the oculomotor nerve.  This nerve controls the movement of the muscles that control eye movements,  as well as the constriction of the pupil.
 Next,  I need to understand what a IIIrd cranial nerve palsy means.  Palsy refers to a condition where the nerve function is impaired.  In this case,  a IIIrd cranial nerve palsy would mean that the oculomotor nerve is not functioning properly.
 Now,  I need to determine which of the choices represents a neurosurgical emergency.  A neurosurgical emergency is a condition that requires immediate surgical intervention to prevent serious complications.
 Among the choices,  a unilateral fixed dilated pupil (c) represents a IIIrd cranial nerve palsy.  When the oculomotor nerve is impaired,  the affected eye's pupil will not constrict properly,  resulting in a fixed and dilated pupil.
 This condition is considered a neurosurgical emergency because it can lead to serious complications,  such as increased intracranial pressure or even brain herniation.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true about a thyroid swelling?  Choices: a) It always elevates on swallowing b) Lymph node enlargement is a good prognostic sign c) An ultrasound of the swelling is the best test to determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone d) A functioning nodule on isotope scanning is unlikely to be due to cancer 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a thyroid swelling is.  A thyroid swelling is typically a nodule,  which is a benign or malignant lump in the thyroid gland.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice based on the characteristics of a thyroid swelling.
 a) It always elevates on swallowing - This is not always true.  Some thyroid swellings may not elevate on swallowing due to the size or location of the nodule.
 b) Lymph node enlargement is a good prognostic sign - This is not a good prognostic sign.  Lymph node enlargement is often associated with cancer,  so it is a bad prognostic sign for a thyroid swelling.
 c) An ultrasound of the swelling is the best test to determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone - This is true.  An ultrasound can help determine the size,  shape,  and composition of the nodule,  as well as whether it is secreting hormones.
 d) A functioning nodule on isotope scanning is unlikely to be due to cancer - This is true.  Isotope scanning can help determine whether a nodule is secreting hormones,  and a functioning nodule is less likely to be cancerous.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true of hepatomegaly?  Choices: a) Emphysema is a cause b) The liver enlarges downwards from the left hypochondrium c) The presence of jaundice,  spider naevi and purpura suggest alcohol as a cause d) The liver is usually resonant to percussion 
 Output:
 First,  let's analyze each choice.  Hepatomegaly is a condition where the liver is enlarged.
 a) Emphysema is a cause - This is incorrect because emphysema is a lung condition,  not related to the liver.
 b) The liver enlarges downwards from the left hypochondrium - This is true because the liver is located in the upper right and left sides of the abdomen,  and when enlarged,  it can push downwards from the left hypochondrium.
 c) The presence of jaundice,  spider naevi and purpura suggest alcohol as a cause - This is incorrect because jaundice,  spider naevi,  and purpura are symptoms of liver disease,  not the cause of hepatomegaly.
 d) The liver is usually resonant to percussion - This is incorrect because a resonant liver is usually a sign of fluid accumulation,  not liver enlargement.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true regarding reflexes?  Choices: a) A positive babinski reflex is the same as a normal flexor response in the assessment of the plantar reflex b) An extensor plantar response indicates a lower motor neurone lesion c) The root value of the ankle reflex is S1  d) The root value of the knee reflex is L1,  L2  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the options and their meanings.  A positive babinski reflex means that the baby's big toe curls upward when the sole of the foot is stroked with a finger or a wooden stick. The normal flexor response in the assessment of the plantar reflex means that the baby's foot flexes when pressure is applied to the sole. These two are not the same,  so option a) is not true.
 An extensor plantar response indicates that the baby's foot extends when pressure is applied to the sole,  which is not a normal response. This can be due to a lower motor neurone lesion,  so option b) is true.
 The ankle reflex,  also known as the Achilles tendon reflex,  is tested by tapping the Achilles tendon with a reflex hammer. The root value of this reflex is S1,  so option c) is true.
 The knee reflex,  also known as the patellar reflex,  is tested by tapping the patellar tendon with a reflex hammer. The root value of this reflex is L2,  not L1 or L2,  so option d) is not true.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true of facial nerve palsy?  Choices: a) Bells palsy is another term for an upper motor neurone lesion b) Ramsay Hunt Syndrome is an upper motor neurone lesion secondary to a Herpes Zoster infection c) An inability to close the eyelid on the paralysed side indicates a lower motor neurone lesion d) In Bell's Palsy the sense of taste is never affected 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the terms and conditions of facial nerve palsy.  Facial nerve palsy is a condition where there is weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face, usually due to damage to the facial nerve.
 Next,  I need to analyze each choice.  a) Bells palsy is another term for an upper motor neurone lesion - This is incorrect because Bell's palsy is a type of facial nerve palsy, not an upper motor neurone lesion.
 b) Ramsay Hunt Syndrome is an upper motor neurone lesion secondary to a Herpes Zoster infection - This is incorrect because Ramsay Hunt Syndrome is a type of facial nerve palsy, not an upper motor neurone lesion.
 c) An inability to close the eyelid on the paralysed side indicates a lower motor neurone lesion - This is correct because a lower motor neurone lesion affects the muscles themselves, leading to an inability to close the eyelid on the paralysed side.
 d) In Bell's Palsy the sense of taste is never affected - This is incorrect because Bell's palsy can affect the taste buds on the side of the face that is paralyzed.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 Next,  I need to consider the choices given and their implications.  Choice a) suggests that lactate concentration rarely increases above 3  mM, which is not accurate as it can increase during exercise.  Choice b) states that lactate concentration is usually lower at the end of the game than at the end of the first half, which is not true as exercise typically increases lactate levels.  Choice c) states that lactate concentration is usually higher at the end of the game than at the end of the first half, which is consistent with the fact that exercise increases lactate levels.  Choice d) states that lactate concentration increases throughout the course of the game as players become more fatigued, which is also consistent with the fact that exercise increases lactate levels.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Lactate and hydrogen ions leave the muscle: Choices: a) via a cotransport mechanism with carnosine.  b) via an active transport mechanism.  c) via a protein transporter molecule.  d) by simple diffusion.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the transport of lactate and hydrogen ions out of the muscle.  Lactate and hydrogen ions are waste products of anaerobic metabolism in muscles,  and they need to be removed to maintain cellular homeostasis.
 Next,  I consider the options provided:
 a) A cotransport mechanism with carnosine: Carnosine is an alkaline buffer in muscles that can bind to lactate and facilitate its removal.
 b) An active transport mechanism: This would require energy to move lactate and hydrogen ions out of the muscle.
 c) A protein transporter molecule: This could be a carrier protein that facilitates the transport of lactate and hydrogen ions.
 d) Simple diffusion: This would be a passive process,  driven by the concentration gradient,  without the need for energy.

"Input: The activity of creatine kinase is: Choices: a) increased when intracellular ADP rises.  b) increased when muscle pH falls below 6.9.  c) always lower in Type II fibres than Type I fibres.  d) increased after a period of endurance training.  
 Output:
 First, let's consider the effect of intracellular ADP on creatine kinase activity. When intracellular ADP rises, it indicates that ATP is being used up for energy, which would typically lead to an increase in creatine kinase activity as it helps to recycle phosphate groups and maintain cellular energy balance. Therefore, choice a) is a possible answer.

Next, let's consider the effect of muscle pH on creatine kinase activity. When muscle pH falls below 6.9, it suggests that there is an increase in acidity, which can impair enzyme function. Creatine kinase is one of these enzymes, and its activity can be reduced under low pH conditions. Therefore, choice b) is also a possible answer.

Now, let's consider the difference in creatine kinase activity between Type I and Type II muscle fibers. Type I fibers are slow-twitch fibers that rely more on oxidative metabolism, while Type II fibers are fast-twitch fibers that rely more on anaerobic metabolism. Creatine kinase is more abundant in Type II fibers due to their higher demand for ATP during intense exercise. Therefore, choice c) is not correct.

Finally, let's consider the effect of endurance training on creatine kinase activity. Endurance training increases the efficiency of energy production and utilization, which can lead to a decrease in the overall demand for ATP and thus a decrease in creatine kinase activity. Therefore, choice d) is not correct.

 b) If telangiectasia are seen this clinches the diagnosis - This statement is also incorrect. Telangiectasia is a common finding in many conditions and is not specific to Systemic Sclerosis.
 c) Arachnodactyly is a feature of the disease - This statement is true. Arachnodactyly, or finger web contractures, is a common feature of Systemic Sclerosis.
 d) Patients have a beaked shaped nose and waxy skin - This statement is incorrect. While some patients may have certain physical features, a beaked shaped nose and waxy skin are not specific to Systemic Sclerosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A palpable left parasternal impulse suggests which abnormality?  Choices: a) Right ventricular hypertrophy b) Aortic stenosis c) Aortic regurgitation d) Left ventricular hypertrophy 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the clinical significance of a palpable left parasternal impulse.  A palpable left parasternal impulse indicates an increased impulse at the left side of the sternum,  which is felt when the heart is enlarged or thickened.
 Next,  I need to consider each of the choices and their relation to a palpable left parasternal impulse.  Right ventricular hypertrophy typically does not cause an enlarged or thickened heart,  so it is not related to a palpable left parasternal impulse.  Aortic stenosis is a condition where the aortic valve is narrowed,  which does not cause an enlarged or thickened heart,  so it is not related to a palpable left parasternal impulse.  Aortic regurgitation is a condition where the aortic valve does not close properly,  which does not cause an enlarged or thickened heart,  so it is not related to a palpable left parasternal impulse.  Left ventricular hypertrophy is a condition where the left ventricle of the heart is thickened due to increased workload,  which can cause an enlarged or thickened heart and a palpable left parasternal impulse.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: In hypovolaemic shock,  what percentage of blood can be lost before it is reflected in changes in heart rate and blood pressure?  Choices: a) 5 % b) 10 % c) 20 % d) 30 % 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of hypovolaemic shock.  Hypovolaemic shock occurs when there is a significant reduction in blood volume,  leading to decreased blood pressure and inadequate perfusion of organs and tissues.
 Next,  I need to consider the body's compensatory mechanisms.  When blood volume decreases,  the body responds by increasing heart rate and constricting blood vessels to try to maintain blood pressure and perfusion.
 Now,  I need to determine the point at which these compensatory mechanisms are activated.  In general,  compensatory mechanisms are activated when blood loss is significant enough to cause a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate.
 Based on research and clinical observations,  it is estimated that compensatory mechanisms are activated when blood loss is approximately 10-20% of the total blood volume.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following best describes the effects of morphine?  Choices: a) Reduces pain intensity and increases alertness.  b) Reduces pain intensity but also causes sedation.  c) Reduces pain intensity but also causes diarrhoea.  d) Reduces pain intensity but also causes insomnia.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the effects of morphine.  Morphine is an opioid pain medication that is used to treat moderate to severe pain.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  Choice a suggests that morphine reduces pain intensity and increases alertness, which is not true because opioids like morphine tend to decrease alertness.
 Choice b states that morphine reduces pain intensity but also causes sedation, which is true because opioids like morphine can cause sedation as a side effect.
 Choice c suggests that morphine reduces pain intensity but also causes diarrhoea, which is not true because morphine does not typically cause diarrhoea.
 Choice d states that morphine reduces pain intensity but also causes insomnia, which is not true because morphine can cause drowsiness and sedation, not insomnia.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true of headache?  Choices: a) When associated with neck stiffness is always due to meningitis b) Severe pain usually indicates a life threatening cause c) Temporal arteritis is strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis d) Tension headaches is a common cause of headache 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze each choice and determine if it is true or false.
 a) When associated with neck stiffness is always due to meningitis - This is false,  because neck stiffness can be caused by other conditions,  not just meningitis.
 b) Severe pain usually indicates a life threatening cause - This is false,  because severe pain does not necessarily mean a life threatening cause,  it could be due to other reasons.
 c) Temporal arteritis is strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis - This is false,  because temporal arteritis is actually associated with giant cell arteritis,  not rheumatoid arthritis.
 d) Tension headaches is a common cause of headache - This is true,  because tension headaches are one of the most common types of headaches.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Between contractions of the left ventricle the blood continues to flow through the vessels because: Choices: a) the atria are contracting.  b) the vessels are contracted.  c) the right ventricle is relaxed.  d) the arteries have elastic recoil.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the process of blood circulation in the heart.  During the contraction of the left ventricle,  blood is pumped out of the ventricle and into the aorta.  Between these contractions,  blood must continue to flow through the vessels.
 Next,  I can eliminate options that do not make sense.  The atria are not responsible for pumping blood out of the heart,  so option a) is not correct.  The vessels are not actively contracting,  so option b) is not correct.  The right ventricle is not involved in the flow of blood through the vessels,  so option c) is not correct.
 This leaves option d) the arteries have elastic recoil.  Elastic recoil allows the arteries to expand and contract,  which helps to push blood through the vessels even when the ventricles are not actively contracting.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: What might make the nurse think a patient could not use an inhaler?  Choices: a) Severe leg ulcers.  b) Previous recovery from an acute exacerbation of asthma.  c) Forthcoming surgery.  d) Poor technique,  physical impairment,  or lack of understanding.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider which of the given options might indicate a patient's inability to use an inhaler.  Severe leg ulcers (a) and previous recovery from an exacerbation of asthma (b) do not directly relate to the ability to use an inhaler.  Forthcoming surgery (c) could be a reason for postponing or avoiding certain activities,  but it does not necessarily mean the patient cannot use an inhaler.
 The option that most directly relates to a patient's inability to use an inhaler is poor technique,  physical impairment,  or lack of understanding (d).  These factors could make it difficult for the patient to properly use an inhaler.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Removal of adhesive strips: Choices: a) can be carried out by the patient.  b) should be undertaken under aseptic conditions.  c) is a specialist skill.  d) should not be undertaken until at least seven days after application.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the options given and evaluate their relevance to the removal of adhesive strips.
 Option a) suggests that the removal can be carried out by the patient.  This is possible,  but it does not guarantee proper removal or prevent potential complications.
 Option b) suggests that the removal should be undertaken under aseptic conditions.  This is important to prevent infection and ensure proper removal,  but it does not necessarily mean that it should only be done by a specialist.
 Option c) states that removal is a specialist skill.  This implies that there may be specific techniques or considerations that require expertise.
 Option d) suggests that removal should not be undertaken until at least seven days after application.  This is a time frame that may be recommended to ensure proper healing and prevent complications.

Upon evaluating the options,  I find that option c) is the most accurate.  Removal of adhesive strips can be a specialist skill,  requiring knowledge of proper techniques and considerations to prevent complications.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: During CPR,  chest compressions should be delivered at a rate of: Choices: a) 80 /minute.  b) as fast as possible.  c) 100 /minute.  d) varies with each patient.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the guidelines provided by the American Heart Association (AHA) and other medical organizations.  According to the AHA,  chest compressions for adult CPR should be delivered at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the given choices.  Choice a) 80 /minute is too slow and may not be effective in delivering blood and oxygen to the patient's brain and other vital organs.  Choice b) as fast as possible is too vague and may lead to inadequate depth or rate of compressions.  Choice d) varies with each patient is partially correct,  as the rate may need to be adjusted based on the patient's condition,  but the guideline provided by the AHA is the standard rate to follow.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following physiological characteristics is not important for success in endurance events such as the marathon race?  Choices: a) The ability to regulate body temperature.  b) The ability to supply oxygen to the exercising muscles.  c) The availability of body stores of carbohydrate.  d) Muscle ATP and phosphocreatine content.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the physiological characteristics that are important for success in endurance events.  Endurance events like the marathon race require efficient oxygen delivery to the muscles,  regulation of body temperature to prevent overheating or hypothermia,  and adequate carbohydrate stores to fuel the muscles.  Muscle ATP and phosphocreatine content are also important for maintaining energy levels during the race.

Next,  I will evaluate each choice to determine which one is not important for success in endurance events.  a) The ability to regulate body temperature is important because maintaining a stable internal temperature is crucial for optimal performance.  b) The ability to supply oxygen to the exercising muscles is important because oxygen is necessary for aerobic metabolism,  which is the primary energy source during endurance events.  c) The availability of body stores of carbohydrate is important because carbohydrates are the preferred energy source for the muscles during prolonged exercise.  d) Muscle ATP and phosphocreatine content is important because these compounds provide immediate energy for muscle contractions during the early stages of the race.

After evaluating each choice,  I can conclude that none of the options are not important for success in endurance events.  Therefore,  there is no correct answer to this question.  The output should be {'sol': 'no answer'}"
"Input: When using an inhaler,  when should a patient be asked to rinse their mouth?  Choices: a) Before using their bronchodilator inhaler.  b) After using their bronchodilator inhaler.  c) Before using their steroid inhaler.  d) After using their steroid inhaler.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the purpose of rinsing the mouth with water after using an inhaler.  The main reason is to reduce the risk of oral and nasal candidiasis,  a fungal infection caused by inhaling the fungus that grows on the inhaler.
 Next,  I need to consider which type of inhaler is more likely to cause this problem.  Bronchodilator inhalers,  such as salbutamol,  are used to relieve symptoms of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by relaxing the muscles around the airways.  Steroid inhalers,  such as beclometasone,  are used to reduce inflammation in the airways and prevent asthma and COPD attacks.
 Steroid inhalers are more likely to cause oral and nasal candidiasis because they deliver higher concentrations of the medication to the mouth and nose.  Therefore,  it is recommended to rinse the mouth with water after using a steroid inhaler.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Muscle lactate production increases when: Choices: a) oxygen is readily available.  b) pyruvate cannot be formed from glucose breakdown.  c) the pH of the muscle falls.  d) glycolysis is activated at the onset of exercise.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the conditions under which muscle lactate production increases.  Lactate production is a result of anaerobic metabolism,  which occurs when oxygen is not readily available to support aerobic respiration.
 Next,  I can eliminate choices that do not fit this condition.  Choice a) oxygen is readily available,  would support aerobic respiration,  not anaerobic,  so it is not correct.  Choice b) pyruvate cannot be formed from glucose breakdown,  is not directly related to lactate production,  so it is not correct.
 Now,  I am left with choices c) the pH of the muscle falls and d) glycolysis is activated at the onset of exercise.  Both of these choices are related to the conditions under which lactate production increases.  However,  choice c) the pH of the muscle falls,  is a consequence of lactate production,  not a cause.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

 First,  I need to consider the options given and determine which one represents the minimum time a stretch should be held for.
 The options are:
 a) 0 -10  seconds
 b) 10 -30  seconds
 c) 30 -50  seconds
 d) 60  seconds

 To find the minimum time,  I should choose the shortest duration among the options.
 The shortest duration is 0 -10  seconds.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: What three factors regulate stroke volume?  Choices: a) Blood volume,  preload,  and afterload.  b) Preload,  contractility,  and afterload.  c) Contractility,  blood volume,  and blood pressure.  d) Cardiac output,  contractility,  and blood volume.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what stroke volume is.  Stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped by the heart in one single beat.
 Next,  I need to consider the factors that regulate stroke volume.  These factors are preload,  contractility,  and afterload.  Preload refers to the amount of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole,  contractility refers to the heart's ability to contract,  and afterload refers to the resistance against which the heart has to pump.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Name the bones of the middle finger in the correct order from the hand.  Choices: a) Proximal phalynx,  middle phalynx,  distal phalynx.  b) Distal phalynx,  middle phalynx,  proximal phalynx.  c) Middle phalynx,  distal phalynx,  proximal phalynx.  d) Distal phalynx,  proximal phalynx,  middle phalynx.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the bones of the middle finger.  The middle finger has three bones,  which are called phalanges.
 Next,  I need to determine the correct order of these bones from the hand.  The proximal phalange is the bone closest to the hand,  the middle phalange is the one in the middle,  and the distal phalange is the one farthest from the hand.
 Therefore,  the correct order of the bones of the middle finger from the hand is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following promotes glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle?  Choices: a) Adrenaline b) Insulin c) Glycogen d) Cortisol 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the substances that are involved in glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle.  Glucose uptake is promoted by insulin,  which is a hormone that helps lower blood glucose levels.  Amino acid uptake is also promoted by insulin,  as it helps regulate protein metabolism.
 Next,  I need to eliminate the choices that do not promote glucose and amino acid uptake.  Adrenaline (a) is a hormone that increases blood glucose levels,  so it does not promote glucose uptake.  Glycogen (c) is a storage form of glucose,  not a substance that promotes uptake.  Cortisol (d) is a hormone that helps the body respond to stress,  but it does not specifically promote glucose and amino acid uptake.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: An ileostomy opening should be: Choices: a) flush with the skin.  b) 3 -5 cm in length.  c) below skin level.  d) over 5 cm in length.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the proper positioning of an ileostomy opening.  An ileostomy is an opening created in the abdominal wall through which waste from the ileum (the last part of the small intestine) is excreted.
 The opening should be positioned in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen,  flush with the skin.  This means that the opening should not be below the skin level,  as that could lead to complications.
 The length of the opening is not a critical factor,  as it can vary depending on the individual and the surgical technique used.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following would not be done before catheterizing?  Choices: a) Gain patient consent.  b) Patient to be washed.  c) Expiry dates to be checked.  d) Ring patient's next of kin.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the steps that are typically done before catheterizing a patient.  Gaining patient consent (a) is necessary to ensure the patient's rights are respected.  Checking the expiry dates (c) is important to ensure the equipment is safe to use.  Notifying the patient's next of kin (d) is also a standard procedure in some cases.
 Next,  I need to identify which of the choices is not a standard procedure before catheterizing.  Washing the patient (b) is not a standard procedure before catheterizing, as it is not necessary for the procedure itself.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Hydrogen ions are formed when: Choices: a) glycogen becomes depleted.  b) phosphocreatine breakdown occurs.  c) pyruvate is converted to lactate.  d) glycolysis is being used as a major means of resynthesising ATP.  
 Output:
 First, let's consider the process of ATP resynthesis and the formation of hydrogen ions. ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the primary energy currency of cells, and its resynthesis is crucial for cellular functions. Hydrogen ions are formed during the breakdown of high-energy phosphate bonds in ATP.

Next, let's examine each choice:
a) Glycogen depletion: Glycogen is a storage form of glucose in animals. When glycogen is depleted, it triggers the breakdown of glycogen into glucose units, which can enter glycolysis. This process does not directly form hydrogen ions in the context of ATP resynthesis.

b) Phosphocreatine breakdown: Phosphocreatine (PCr) is a high-energy molecule that can rapidly donate a phosphate group to ADP, forming ATP. This process does not involve the formation of hydrogen ions in the context of ATP resynthesis.

c) Pyruvate conversion to lactate: This process occurs during anaerobic respiration when oxygen is limited. Pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, is converted to lactate. This reaction consumes hydrogen ions (H+) and generates lactate, which is a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism.

d) Glycolysis as a major means of resynthesizing ATP: Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate, generating a net gain of 2 ATP molecules and 2 NADH molecules per glucose molecule. The NADH molecules are involved in the electron transport chain, which generates ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, not directly through the formation of hydrogen ions.

Based on this analysis, the process that directly involves the formation of hydrogen ions is the conversion of pyruvate to lactate (choice c). This reaction consumes hydrogen ions and generates lactate, which is a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which one of the following manoeuvres is not a central painful stimulus?  Choices: a) Supra-orbital ridge pressure.  b) Pressure on the little finger pulp.  c) Trapezius squeeze.  d) Sternal rub.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the central painful stimuli.  These are stimuli that originate from the central nervous system.  They are not caused by external factors.
 Next,  I will go through the choices and determine which one is not a central painful stimulus.
 a) Supra-orbital ridge pressure: This is a peripheral painful stimulus,  as it is caused by pressure on the skin.
 b) Pressure on the little finger pulp: This is also a peripheral painful stimulus,  as it is caused by pressure on the skin.
 c) Trapezius squeeze: This is a central painful stimulus,  as it is caused by muscle tension and originates from the central nervous system.
 d) Sternal rub: This is a peripheral painful stimulus,  as it is caused by friction between the skin and another surface.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Dopamine is prescribed at a rate of 4  micrograms/kg/min.  For a 65  kg person,  how many milligrams will they receive in an hour?  Choices: a) 156  b) 15.6  c) 1.56  d) 15600  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the total dose in micrograms per minute.  The dose is 4  micrograms/kg/min,  and the person weighs 65  kg,  so the dose is 4  * 65  = 260  micrograms/min.
 Next,  I need to calculate the total dose in micrograms per hour.  There are 60  minutes in an hour,  so the dose is 260  * 60  = 15600  micrograms/hour.
 Finally,  I need to convert the dose from micrograms to milligrams.  There are 1000  micrograms in a milligram,  so the dose is 15600  ÷ 1000  = 15.6  milligrams/hour.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true about the rectal examination?  Choices: a) If the patient refuses a chaperone the doctor can overrule them b) The rectal examination is of no value in a neurological examination c) The optimum position of the patient is on their right side with their knees extended d) The rectal examination is indicated for the assessment of some gastrointestinal disorders 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze each choice and determine if it is true or false.
 a) If the patient refuses a chaperone the doctor can overrule them - This choice is false.  A doctor cannot overrule a patient's refusal for a chaperone during a rectal examination.
 b) The rectal examination is of no value in a neurological examination - This choice is false.  The rectal examination can be valuable in a neurological examination,  especially for assessing the lower motor neurons.
 c) The optimum position of the patient is on their right side with their knees extended - This choice is false.  The optimum position for a rectal examination is usually with the patient lying on their left side,  not on their right side.
 d) The rectal examination is indicated for the assessment of some gastrointestinal disorders - This choice is true.  The rectal examination can be used to assess some gastrointestinal disorders,  such as rectal bleeding or proctitis.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Why can't a patient talk if the cuff is inflated?  Choices: a) They are unable to breathe in sufficiently.  b) They are unable to swallow properly.  c) It is too tiring.  d) They are unable to pass air through their vocal cords.  
 Output:
 First,  consider the context of the question.  The patient is unable to talk,  which is related to the ability to produce sound.
 Next,  think about what factors could affect the production of sound.  One key factor is the ability to pass air through the vocal cords.
 Finally,  consider the situation described in the question.  If the cuff is inflated,  it is likely referring to the inflatable cuff used during a blood pressure measurement.  Inflating the cuff restricts blood flow and,  as a result,  can limit the amount of air that can pass through the patient's lungs.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Wound drainage should be assessed for volume and consistency: Choices: a) each time post-operative observations are undertaken.  b) daily.  c) every hour.  d) only when the wound dressing is changed.  
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the importance of wound drainage assessment.  Wound drainage is an important indicator of wound healing and infection.  Assessing it regularly helps in monitoring the wound status and taking appropriate actions.
 Next,  we consider the frequency of assessment.  Assessing wound drainage too frequently (every hour) or too infrequently (only when the dressing is changed) may not provide timely information about the wound status.  Assessing it daily (option b) provides a balance between timely assessment and not overburdening the patient with frequent assessments.
 Finally,  we compare the options.  Assessing wound drainage each time post-operative observations are undertaken (option a) may include other assessments as well, and it is not specific to wound drainage.  Assessing it daily (option b) is a standard practice in wound management.  Assessing it only when the dressing is changed (option d) may not provide timely information.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

 Next,  I need to consider the effect of temperature on the solution and the patient.  Choosing a temperature that is too cold or too warm could potentially cause discomfort or harm to the patient.
 Finally,  I need to consider the stability of the solution.  Refrigerating the solution can help maintain its stability and prevent bacterial growth.
 Based on these considerations,  the best choice for the bladder washout solution is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: When developing a plan of care relating to the management of a person's pain,  attention should be given to the following needs: Choices: a) physical and pharmacological needs only.  b) physical and psychological needs only.  c) physical,  psychological,  and pharmacological needs followed by regular reassessment.  d) none of the above,  as the main priority is to limit drug side effects.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the different aspects of pain management.  Pain is a complex experience that can have both physical and psychological components.  Physical pain is related to the body's response to injury or disease, while psychological pain is related to emotional and mental factors.
 Next,  I need to consider the treatment options for pain.  Pharmacological treatments involve the use of medications to alleviate pain, but they may not be effective for all patients or situations.  Physical treatments, such as physical therapy or massage, can help manage physical pain, while psychological treatments, such as counseling or cognitive-behavioral therapy, can help manage psychological pain.
 Finally,  I need to consider the importance of regular reassessment.  Pain management should be an ongoing process that involves regularly evaluating the patient's needs and adjusting the plan as necessary.  This ensures that the patient's pain is effectively managed and that their overall well-being is maintained.
 Based on these considerations,  the most comprehensive approach to pain management is to address both physical and psychological needs,  as well as pharmacological needs,  followed by regular reassessment.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

"Input: Which of the following groups of drugs may cause a dry mouth?  Choices: a) Steroids.  b) Analgesics.  c) Antidepressants.  d) Antifungal agents.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the side effects of each group of drugs.  Steroids can cause a variety of side effects,  including a dry mouth.
 Analgesics,  such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),  can also cause a dry mouth as a side effect.
 Antidepressants,  such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),  can cause a dry mouth as a side effect.
 Antifungal agents,  such as clotrimazole and nystatin,  do not typically cause a dry mouth as a side effect.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following is not a true statement?  Choices: a) Muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1 -phosphate b) Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles c) Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration d) Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body 
 Output:
 First,  I will go through each statement and evaluate its truthfulness.
 a) Muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1 -phosphate: This statement is true.  Muscle glycogen is broken down into glucose-1-phosphate through the action of glycogen phosphorylase.
 b) Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles: This statement is true.  Type I fibres are slow-twitch fibres that are more efficient at using oxygen, making them ideal for endurance activities.  Elite endurance runners typically have a higher proportion of Type I fibres.
 c) Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration: This statement is true.  Liver glycogen serves as a storage form of glucose that can be quickly mobilized and converted back into glucose to maintain blood glucose levels.
 d) Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body: This statement is false.  Insulin does promote glucose uptake by most tissues, but not all.  For example, it does not significantly affect glucose uptake by the brain or the kidneys.

"Input: If a patient is cyanosed,  what might their oxygen saturation level be?  Choices: a) 98 % or above.  b) 94 % or above.  c) 80 % or below.  d) 85 % or above.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what cyanosis is.  Cyanosis is a condition where the skin appears blue or purple due to low oxygen levels in the blood.
 Next,  I need to consider the oxygen saturation level.  Oxygen saturation is a measure of the percentage of hemoglobin in the blood that is bound to oxygen.
 Now,  I can evaluate the choices.  Option a) 98 % or above is not related to cyanosis because it indicates high oxygen levels.  Option b) 94 % or above is also not related to cyanosis because it is still within the normal range.  Option d) 85 % or above is still within the normal range and not related to cyanosis.
 Option c) 80 % or below indicates low oxygen levels,  which is consistent with the definition of cyanosis.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: When assessing a patient's breathing: Choices: a) always remove dentures.  b) look for chest movements and use a mirror to check for exhaled air.  c) look for chest movements,  listen for breath sounds,  and feel for exhaled air on your cheek.  d) assess for 30  seconds.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the most appropriate method to assess a patient's breathing.  Looking for chest movements and listening for breath sounds are both important steps in assessing breathing.  Feeling for exhaled air on the cheek can also provide additional information.
 Next,  removing dentures is not a necessary step in assessing breathing,  as it does not directly affect the assessment of breathing.  It may be necessary in some cases,  but it is not a universal step.
 Finally,  assessing for 30  seconds is a reasonable duration to assess a patient's breathing,  as it allows for a comprehensive assessment of breathing patterns.
 Therefore,  the most appropriate method to assess a patient's breathing is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A person is prescribed Ropinirole 1.5  mg divided into three doses.  How many micrograms is each dose?  Choose one answer from the following: Choices: a) 5  b) 50  c) 0.5  d) 500  
 Output:
 First,  I need to convert the total amount from milligrams to micrograms.  Since 1  mg is equal to 1000  micrograms,  1.5  mg is equal to 1.5  * 1000  = 1500  micrograms.
 Next,  I need to divide the total amount by the number of doses.  The person is prescribed 1.5  mg divided into three doses,  so each dose is 1500  ÷ 3  = 500  micrograms.

 Output:
 First, let's understand what the auscultatory gap is. It refers to the difference in blood pressure readings between the systolic and diastolic phases when using a sphygmomanometer.

Next, let's analyze the choices:

a) This choice suggests that the gap occurs when Korotkoff sounds are no longer heard because the bladder is equal with the diastolic pressure. This is incorrect because the sounds stop when the bladder is equal to or greater than the systolic pressure, not the diastolic.

b) This choice states that the gap is when Korotkoff sounds can be heard between systolic and diastolic phases. This is incorrect because the sounds should stop between these phases, not continue.

c) This choice describes a scenario where the sounds disappear and then return during phase 2 as the bladder is deflated. This is not the definition of the auscultatory gap.

d) This choice suggests that the gap occurs when the Korotkoff sounds do not disappear when the cuff is fully deflated. This is the correct definition, as the sounds should not disappear completely when the cuff pressure is equal to or lower than the systolic pressure, indicating a gap between the measured systolic and diastolic pressures.

"Input: Which of the following is not associated with an increase in the work of breathing?  Choices: a) Rise in respiratory rate.  b) Noisy breathing.  c) Increase in the use of accessory muscles.  d) A respiratory rate of 16  breaths per minute.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what is meant by an increase in the work of breathing.  This refers to a situation where the body is having to work harder to breathe,  such as during exercise or when there is a problem with the respiratory system.
 Next,  I need to consider each choice and determine if it is associated with an increase in the work of breathing.  A rise in respiratory rate is associated with an increase in the work of breathing,  as the body is trying to move more air in and out of the lungs.  Noisy breathing can also be associated with an increase in the work of breathing,  as it can indicate that the body is having difficulty breathing normally.  An increase in the use of accessory muscles can also be associated with an increase in the work of breathing,  as these muscles may be used to help breathe more forcefully.
 The choice d) A respiratory rate of 16  breaths per minute is not necessarily associated with an increase in the work of breathing.  A respiratory rate of 16  breaths per minute is within the normal range for adults,  and it does not necessarily indicate that the body is working harder to breathe.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following can act as an intracellular buffer to limit pH changes when the rate of glycolysis is high?  Choices: a) Glutamine b) Glucose c) Carnosine d) Amylase 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify which of the choices can act as an intracellular buffer.  An intracellular buffer is a molecule that can resist changes in pH by neutralizing excess hydrogen ions (H+) or hydroxide ions (OH-).
 Next,  I need to consider the context of high glycolysis rates.  Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose to produce energy.  During glycolysis,  the production of hydrogen ions can lead to a decrease in pH,  or an acidic environment.
 Now,  I need to evaluate each choice in terms of its ability to act as an intracellular buffer and limit pH changes during high glycolysis rates.  Glutamine can bind to excess hydrogen ions and help maintain pH balance.  Glucose is a substrate for glycolysis and does not act as a buffer.  Carnosine can bind to hydrogen ions and act as a buffer.  Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch to simple sugars,  and it does not act as a buffer.

"Input: Where should a stoma be sited?  Choices: a) The rectus sheath abdominus.  b) Next to the umbilicus.  c) Within an abdominal crease.  d) In close proximity to the incision site.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the location where a stoma should be sited for optimal healing and function.  A stoma is an opening in the body where waste exits,  and it should be placed in a location that is easily accessible for care and easy to clean.
 Next,  I can eliminate options that are not ideal for these reasons.  Option a) The rectus sheath abdominus is not an ideal location because it is a muscle and may not provide enough support for the stoma.  Option d) In close proximity to the incision site is also not ideal because it may be difficult to care for and clean the stoma near an incision.
 Now,  I am left with options b) Next to the umbilicus and c) Within an abdominal crease.  Both of these options are relatively easy to access and clean,  but option c) Within an abdominal crease is the most common and preferred location for a stoma because it provides a natural area for the stoma to sit and is less likely to cause irritation or discomfort.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 First,  I need to identify the type of genetic material in living organisms.  Genetic material is responsible for storing and transmitting genetic information.
 Next,  I recall that there are two main types of nucleic acids: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA).  DNA is the primary genetic material in most organisms,  including humans,  while RNA is involved in the process of protein synthesis.
 The option 'c',  dinitronucleic acid,  is not a recognized type of nucleic acid.  The option 'd',  protein,  is not the genetic material,  but it is a type of biomolecule that plays many important roles in the body.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Insensible loss does not come from: Choices: a) pyrexia.  b) using unhumidified oxygen.  c) excessive weight loss.  d) diarrhoea.  
 Output:
 First, let's consider what insensible loss is. Insensible loss refers to the loss of body fluids that occurs without conscious effort or sensation, typically through the skin, lungs, or gastrointestinal tract.

Next, let's analyze each choice:
a) Pyrexia, or fever, causes an increase in heat production by the body, which can lead to increased sweating as the body tries to cool down. This is an example of insensible loss.
b) Using unhumidified oxygen can lead to water loss through the lungs, as the dry oxygen can cause the airways to become dry and irritated, leading to increased water vapor loss. This is also an example of insensible loss.
c) Excessive weight loss is not a direct cause of insensible loss. While losing weight can affect the body's overall fluid balance, it is not a specific mechanism of fluid loss in the same way as the other choices.
d) Diarrhoea is a direct cause of fluid loss, as it involves the rapid passage of fluid and electrolytes through the gastrointestinal tract. This is an example of insensible loss.

Based on the analysis, the choice that does not represent insensible loss is c) excessive weight loss.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Exhaustion,  confusion,  and unresponsiveness can be indicators of: Choices: a) respiratory failure.  b) being generally unwell.  c) renal failure.  d) cardiac failure.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the symptoms provided: exhaustion,  confusion,  and unresponsiveness.
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice in relation to these symptoms.
 a) Respiratory failure can cause shortness of breath,  which can lead to exhaustion,  but confusion and unresponsiveness are less common.
 b) Being generally unwell can cause a variety of symptoms,  including exhaustion,  confusion,  and unresponsiveness.
 c) Renal failure can cause fatigue and confusion,  but unresponsiveness is less common.
 d) Cardiac failure can cause fatigue,  but confusion and unresponsiveness are less common.

Based on the symptom evaluation,  the most likely answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Pairs of electrons carried in the form,  FADH2  and NADH+H,  collectively contain enough free energy to rephosphorylate: Choices: a) 6  ATP.  b) 5  ATP.  c) 4  ATP.  d) 3  ATP.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the energy yield from each electron carrier.  FADH2  and NADH+H  each carry 2  electrons.
 In the electron transport chain,  each electron is worth approximately 5  ATP.
 Since there are 2  electrons in each FADH2  and NADH+H,  the energy yield from each is 2  * 5  = 10  ATP.
 Now,  I need to consider the total number of ATP produced from the energy yield of both electron carriers.  Since each carries enough energy to rephosphorylate 10  ATP,  and there are two carriers (FADH2  and NADH+H),  the total ATP produced is 10  * 2  = 20  ATP.
 However,  the choices provided do not include 20  ATP,  so I need to reevaluate the question.  It seems there is a mistake in the question as it states that each carrier contains enough free energy to rephosphorylate 10  ATP,  which is not accurate.  In reality,  each carrier can rephosphorylate approximately 2-3  ATP.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A muscle fibre relaxes when: Choices: a) the nerve stimulus is removed.  b) the nerve stimulus is too forceful.  c) the actin binding sites are uncovered.  d) the actin binding sites are saturated.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the process of muscle fibre relaxation.  Muscle fibres relax when the nerve stimulus is removed,  which leads to the uncovering of actin binding sites.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following best describes the Golgi tendon organ?  Choices: a) Proprioceptive motor receptor found within main muscle body.  b) Proprioceptive sensory receptor found at the junction between muscle and tendon.  c) Proprioceptive sensory receptor found within main muscle body.  d) Proprioceptive motor receptor found at the junction between muscle and tendon.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what the Golgi tendon organ is.  It is a proprioceptive sensory receptor that is found at the junction between the muscle and the tendon.
 Next,  I need to compare the given choices to the definition.  Choice a) mentions the main muscle body, which is not where the Golgi tendon organ is located.  Choice c) also mentions the main muscle body, which is incorrect.  Choice d) mentions the junction between the muscle and tendon, which is correct.  Choice b) is the correct description of the Golgi tendon organ.
 Therefore,  the best description of the Golgi tendon organ is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: The pulse can be palpated: Choices: a) every time the atria contracts.  b) when a vein is close to the surface of the skin.  c) every time the left ventricle contracts.  d) when an artery is close to the surface of the skin.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what palpation of the pulse means.  Palpation of the pulse refers to the physical feeling or touching of the rhythmic expansion and contraction of blood in the arteries.
 Next,  I need to consider the options given.  Option a) every time the atria contract is incorrect because the pulse is not palpable during atrial contraction.
 Option b) when a vein is close to the surface of the skin is also incorrect because veins do not carry blood rhythmically enough to be palpable as a pulse.
 Option c) every time the left ventricle contracts is incorrect for the same reason as option a),  the pulse is not palpable during ventricular contraction.
 Option d) when an artery is close to the surface of the skin is the correct answer because arteries carry blood rhythmically and palpation of the pulse is typically done on arteries that are close to the surface of the skin,  such as the radial artery on the wrist or the carotid artery in the neck.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex: Choices: a) is located in the sarcoplasm.  b) catalyses the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA.  c) catalyses the conversion of pyruvate to lactate.  d) catalyses the conversion of lactate to pyruvate.

 First,  I need to identify the function of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.  This complex is involved in the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA,  which is a key step in cellular respiration.
 Next,  I need to consider the location of the complex.  It is not located in the sarcoplasm,  which is the cytoplasmic fluid of muscle cells.  Instead,  the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is located in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells.
 Finally,  I need to evaluate the other choices.  Choice c) refers to the conversion of pyruvate to lactate,  which occurs during anaerobic respiration and is not directly catalysed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.  Choice d) refers to the conversion of lactate to pyruvate,  which is the reverse process and is not directly catalysed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze each choice and determine if it is true or false about the knee joint.
 a) The knee is a ball and socket joint - False.  The knee is a hinge joint, not a ball and socket joint.
 b) A baker's cyst can sometimes be found anterior to the knee - True.  A baker's cyst, also known as a popliteal cyst, can develop behind the knee and sometimes protrude anteriorly.
 c) The patellar tap is used to demonstrate an effusion - True.  The patellar tap is a physical examination technique used to assess for joint effusion by tapping the patella and feeling for fluid.
 d) 'knock knee' deformity is due to bilateral genu varum - False.  'Knock knee' deformity is also known as genu valgum, and it is characterized by the knees being pulled inward, not outward as in genu varum.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Who is the publication Your guide to the NHS written for?  Choices: a) GPs.  b) Patient lobby groups.  c) The general public.  d) Patients admitted to hospital.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the purpose of the publication.  The title ""Your guide to the NHS"" suggests that it is meant to provide information and guidance to people who use the National Health Service.
 Next,  I consider the target audience for such a publication.  It would be most useful for people who are not healthcare professionals,  as they are the ones who need guidance on navigating the healthcare system.
 Finally,  I compare the choices to the target audience.  a) GPs are healthcare professionals,  so they are not the target audience.  b) Patient lobby groups are involved in advocating for patients,  but they are not the general public.  d) Patients admitted to hospital are a specific subset of the general public.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true about the assessment of arm reflexes?  Choices: a) The root value of the biceps reflex is C5,  C6  b) If no reflex is elicited when you tap a tendon it is documented as absent c) The triceps tendon is struck in the antecubital fossa d) Brisk finger jerks confirm a lower motor neurone lesion 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze each choice and compare it to the known facts about arm reflexes.
 a) The root value of the biceps reflex is C5,  C6.  This is true,  as the biceps reflex is a proprioceptive reflex that is tested by tapping the biceps tendon and is innervated by C5 and C6.
 b) If no reflex is elicited when you tap a tendon it is documented as absent.  This is also true,  as the absence of a reflex indicates a possible neurological deficit.
 c) The triceps tendon is struck in the antecubital fossa.  This is false,  as the triceps reflex is tested by tapping the triceps tendon on the back of the elbow,  not in the antecubital fossa.
 d) Brisk finger jerks confirm a lower motor neurone lesion.  This is false,  as brisk finger jerks are a sign of upper motor neuron involvement,  not lower motor neuron involvement.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of these is most likely to cause deviation of the trachea?  Choices: a) A left basal pneumonia b) A small right pleural effusion c) Previous tuberculosis of the right upper lobe d) Idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider which of these conditions is most likely to cause physical obstruction or compression of the trachea.  A left basal pneumonia is a lower lobe infection,  which is unlikely to directly cause tracheal deviation.  A small right pleural effusion is a fluid buildup in the pleural space,  which is also unlikely to directly cause tracheal deviation.  Idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis is a type of interstitial lung disease,  which may cause some degree of airway obstruction,  but it is not as directly related to tracheal deviation as the other choices.
 Next,  I need to consider the history of previous tuberculosis of the right upper lobe.  Tuberculosis is a severe lung infection that can cause scarring and fibrosis,  which can lead to tracheal deviation due to the physical compression of the trachea by the scar tissue.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: What is the risk if water is used for bladder washout in secondary care?  Choices: a) Fluid may bypass when the washout is carried out.  b) Bladder washout may be unsuccessful.  c) Using water may cause electrolyte imbalance.  d) The medical staff may be unhappy.  
 Output:
 First,  we need to consider the possible risks associated with using water for bladder washout in secondary care.  Water is a neutral substance and does not have any inherent risk of causing electrolyte imbalance.
 Next,  the risk of fluid bypassing when the washout is carried out is minimal,  as the purpose of the washout is to remove fluid from the bladder.
 Bladder washout may be unsuccessful if the procedure is not performed correctly or if there are underlying issues preventing the removal of fluid.
 Finally,  the medical staff's happiness is not a relevant risk in this context.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to identify which of the choices is not a controlled drug.  A controlled drug is a substance that is subject to legal restrictions on its manufacture,  distribution,  prescription,  and use.
 Next,  I will examine each choice and determine if it is a controlled drug.  a) A 30  milligram ampoule of Codeine Phosphate for injection is a controlled drug because Codeine is a controlled substance.  b) A sustained release Morphine tablet is also a controlled drug because Morphine is a controlled substance.  c) A 12.5  microgram Fentanyl patch is a controlled drug because Fentanyl is a controlled substance.  d) A 500  ml bottle of Morphine 10  mg in 5  ml in oral suspension is a controlled drug because Morphine is a controlled substance.
 None of the choices provided is not a controlled drug.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'None'}"
"Input: After what period of time does maximal dynamic exercise become predominantly aerobic?  Choices: a) 10  seconds b) 30  seconds c) 1  minute d) 4  minutes 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the difference between maximal dynamic exercise and aerobic exercise.  Maximal dynamic exercise refers to high-intensity exercises that require quick bursts of energy,  while aerobic exercise is a type of exercise that uses oxygen to fuel the muscles.
 Next,  I need to consider the transition point between maximal dynamic exercise and aerobic exercise.  As the intensity and duration of the exercise increase,  the reliance on oxygen for energy also increases.
 Finally,  I need to compare the given choices to find the period of time when maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic.  After 10  seconds,  the exercise is still considered maximal dynamic.  After 30  seconds,  the exercise is starting to become more aerobic.  After 1  minute,  the exercise is predominantly aerobic.  After 4  minutes,  the exercise is still predominantly aerobic.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The trigger to initiate the contractile process in skeletal muscle is: Choices: a) potassium binding to myosin.  b) calcium binding to tropomyosin.  c) ATP binding to the myosin cross bridges.  d) calcium binding to troponin.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the process of muscle contraction.  In skeletal muscle,  contraction is initiated by the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
 Next,  I need to identify which choice is responsible for the trigger of the contractile process.  Calcium binding to troponin is the correct answer,  as it causes a conformational change in the troponin-tropomyosin complex,  allowing myosin to bind to actin and initiate contraction.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following is NOT a sign of phlebitis?  Choices: a) Swelling.  b) Redness.  c) Exudate.  d) Cool to the touch.

 Output:
 First, let's consider the definition of energy charge. Energy charge refers to the extent to which the total adenine nucleotide pool is phosphorylated. This means it is a measure of the cell's ability to produce ATP, which is the cell's main energy currency.

Next, let's evaluate the choices given:
a) The difference between the charge on the outside and inside of a cell. This choice is related to the membrane potential, not the energy charge.
b) Generated by the sodium-potassium ATPase. This choice is partially correct as the sodium-potassium ATPase is one of the processes that contributes to the energy charge, but it doesn't fully define it.
c) The overall rate of energy use by the cell. This choice is related to the cell's energy metabolism but doesn't directly define energy charge.
d) The extent to which the total adenine nucleotide pool is phosphorylated. This choice directly matches the definition of energy charge.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

Choices: a) It causes stridor due to compression of the oesophagus b) Dysphagia is an indication for surgery c) It causes hoarseness due to compression of the trachea d) It causes a more florid thyrotoxicosis than a smaller goitre 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the definition of a goitre. A goitre is an enlargement of the thyroid gland, which can compress surrounding structures.
 Next, let's analyze each choice in relation to the complications of a large goitre.
 a) A large goitre can compress the surrounding structures, including the airway, leading to stridor. So, this choice is plausible.
 b) Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, can be an indication for surgery in some cases of a large goitre, but it is not a universal indication. So, this choice is not definitive.
 c) A large goitre can compress the trachea, leading to hoarseness or difficulty breathing. So, this choice is plausible.
 d) A large goitre does not necessarily cause a more florid thyrotoxicosis (overactive thyroid) than a smaller goitre. The severity of thyrotoxicosis depends on the function of the thyroid gland, not just its size. So, this choice is not true.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The heart has: Choices: a) two valves and two chambers.  b) four valves and four chambers.  c) two valves and four chambers.  d) four valves and two chambers.

 First,  I need to understand the clinical features associated with mitral valve disease and mitral regurgitation.  Mitral regurgitation is characterized by a pan-systolic murmur and a displaced apex beat.
 Next,  I need to identify which combination of features is most suggestive of mixed mitral valve disease with a predominance of mitral regurgitation.  This means that the combination should have both mitral valve disease features and mitral regurgitation features.
 Finally,  I examine the choices and look for the combination that includes a displaced apex beat and a pan-systolic murmur,  which are both associated with mitral regurgitation.  The other features are not as specific to mitral regurgitation.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Prior to undergoing a painful procedure,  a patient should be informed about what to expect and how their pain will be controlled,  as this is associated with: Choices: a) a reduction in anxiety and perceived pain intensity.  b) an increased use of analgesia.  c) a decrease in the frequency of pain-related problems such as nausea and vomiting.  d) an increased urine output.  
 Output:
 First,  let's consider the statement: ""Prior to undergoing a painful procedure,  a patient should be informed about what to expect and how their pain will be controlled.""  This implies that the patient should be well-prepared and have a clear understanding of the procedure and the pain management strategies.

Next,  we need to evaluate the choices based on this information.  a) a reduction in anxiety and perceived pain intensity suggests that informing the patient about the procedure and pain management can help them feel less anxious and experience less pain.  b) an increased use of analgesia implies that the patient may require more pain medication due to the procedure, which is not directly related to the patient being informed beforehand.  c) a decrease in the frequency of pain-related problems such as nausea and vomiting suggests that informing the patient about pain management may help reduce side effects, which could be a consequence of better pain control.  d) an increased urine output is not related to the patient being informed about the procedure and pain management.

Based on the analysis,  the choice that best aligns with the statement is a) a reduction in anxiety and perceived pain intensity.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: The conversion of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate results in the net formation of: Choices: a) six molecules of water.  b) two molecules of ATP.  c) three molecules of ATP.  d) thirty-eight molecules of ATP.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the process of glycolysis,  which is the conversion of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate.  During glycolysis,  the glucose molecule is broken down into two pyruvate molecules,  and some ATP is produced.
 In the beginning of glycolysis,  two molecules of ATP are used to phosphorylate the glucose molecule,  converting it into glucose-6-phosphate.  So,  at this point,  we have used two ATP molecules.
 Then,  the glucose-6-phosphate is converted into two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate,  and for each of these conversions,  two more ATP molecules are produced.  So,  we have a net gain of four ATP molecules.
 Finally,  two molecules of NAD+ are reduced to two molecules of NADH during the conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to pyruvate.
 So,  the net formation during the conversion of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate is two molecules of ATP.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: The net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis is: Choices: a) 2  from glucose and 3  from glycogen.  b) 2  from glucose and 4  from glycogen.  c) 3  from glucose and 4  from glycogen.  d) 3  from glucose and 2  from glycogen.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the process of substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis.  In glycolysis,  one molecule of glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate.  For each molecule of glucose,  two ATP molecules are produced through substrate-level phosphorylation.
 Next,  I need to consider glycogen.  Glycogen is a branched polysaccharide of glucose that serves as a storage form of glucose in animals.  When glycogen is broken down,  it is first converted into glucose-1-phosphate,  which can then enter glycolysis.  For each molecule of glycogen,  four ATP molecules are produced through substrate-level phosphorylation.
 Comparing the choices,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true about rectal bleeding?  Choices: a) A painful digital examination suggests an anal fissure b) Bright red blood on the finger usually signifies a caecal lesion c) Proctoscopy is of no value in the assessment of rectal bleeding d) Rectal cancer is the commonest cause of rectal bleeding 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze each choice and determine if it is true or false.
 a) A painful digital examination suggests an anal fissure - This is true.  Anal fissures are painful and can be diagnosed through a digital examination.
 b) Bright red blood on the finger usually signifies a caecal lesion - This is false.  Bright red blood usually signifies lower rectum or anal bleeding, not caecal lesions.
 c) Proctoscopy is of no value in the assessment of rectal bleeding - This is false.  Proctoscopy is a valuable tool in assessing rectal bleeding, as it allows direct visualization of the lower rectum and anus.
 d) Rectal cancer is the commonest cause of rectal bleeding - This is false.  While rectal cancer can cause bleeding, it is not the most common cause.  Most cases of rectal bleeding are due to conditions like hemorrhoids or anal fissures.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Mutations are errors in DNA that: Choices: a) are always harmful.  b) only occur in the presence of carcinogens.  c) increase tumour growth.  d) occur spontaneously at a low rate.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the nature of mutations.  Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence,  which can result from various factors,  including errors during DNA replication,  exposure to carcinogens,  and other environmental factors.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the given choices.  Choice a) states that mutations are always harmful,  which is not true,  as some mutations may have no effect or even be beneficial.  Choice b) suggests that mutations only occur in the presence of carcinogens,  which is also not accurate,  as mutations can happen spontaneously.  Choice c) claims that mutations increase tumour growth,  which is not always the case,  as mutations are not the direct cause of tumour growth,  but they can contribute to it by promoting uncontrolled cell division.
 Finally,  choice d) states that mutations occur spontaneously at a low rate,  which is a more accurate description of mutations.  Some mutations happen spontaneously,  without the need for external factors.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze each choice and determine which one is the most important for patients to remember when taking paracetamol.
 Choice a) states that paracetamol can interfere with the effectiveness of other drugs such as Warfarin.  This is an important point,  as patients need to be aware of potential drug interactions.
 Choice b) suggests that paracetamol should only be given on an 'as required' basis.  This is not necessarily true,  as paracetamol can be prescribed on a regular schedule.
 Choice c) advises patients to carefully check the contents of over-the-counter cold remedies to prevent accidental overdose.  This is a good piece of advice,  as patients should be aware of the amount of paracetamol they are taking.
 Choice d) states that paracetamol is contraindicated in patients with pyrexia.  This is incorrect,  as paracetamol is often used to relieve fever.
 After analyzing each choice,  the most important piece of information for patients to remember is the potential for drug interactions,  as mentioned in choice a).
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following molecules does not form part of DNA?  Choices: a) Purine b) Pyrimidine c) Deoxyribose d) Amino acid

 Output:
 First, I need to understand what metabolism is. Metabolism refers to the sum of all chemical reactions that occur within a living organism, including the breakdown of nutrients to produce energy and the synthesis of new molecules.

Next, I need to consider which of the given choices is directly related to the process of metabolism. The size of proteins in the cell (a) could be a factor, but it is not the primary determinant of metabolism. The availability of amino acids (b) is important for protein synthesis, but it is not the sole factor that determines metabolism. The proteins formed as dictated by the genetic material (c) are essential components of metabolism, as they are involved in many of the chemical reactions that occur within an organism. The amino acid composition of ribonucleic acids (d) is related to protein synthesis, but it is not the primary determinant of metabolism.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: How many chromosomes do all human somatic cells contain?  Choices: a) 3  b) 20  c) 23  d) 46  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand that somatic cells are body cells that are not reproductive cells (gametes).  In humans,  gametes (sperm and egg cells) contain 23  chromosomes each.
 Next,  somatic cells are formed through the process of mitosis,  which is the division of a parent cell into two daughter cells.  Mitosis ensures that each daughter cell receives an identical set of chromosomes as the parent cell.
 Since humans have 46  chromosomes in total,  and somatic cells are formed through mitosis,  all human somatic cells contain 46  chromosomes.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Under what circumstances would you use antibiotics prior to catheterization?  Choices: a) If the patient has had a catheter in situ for a week.  b) If the patient does not have urinary tract infection.  c) If patient has an artificial heart valve.  d) If the patient requests them.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the general guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis before catheterization.  The primary goal is to prevent infection,  so I should look for situations where the risk of infection is high.
 Next,  I can eliminate options that do not increase the risk of infection.  Option b) If the patient does not have urinary tract infection,  is not a reason to use antibiotics prior to catheterization,  since the goal is to prevent infection,  not treat one that is already present.
 Option d) If the patient requests them,  is not a valid reason,  as the decision should be based on medical necessity,  not patient preference.
 Now,  I am left with options a) If the patient has had a catheter in situ for a week and c) If patient has an artificial heart valve.  Both of these options increase the risk of infection,  so antibiotics may be used.
 However,  option a) If the patient has had a catheter in situ for a week,  is a specific situation that may require antibiotics,  while option c) If patient has an artificial heart valve,  is a general risk factor for infection that may require antibiotics prior to catheterization.

 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  Choice a) suggests that SARMs are steroid drugs mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones.  Choice b) suggests that SARMs are steroid drugs antagonizing the effects of natural steroid hormones.  Choice c) suggests that SARMs are non-steroid drugs mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones.  Choice d) suggests that SARMs are non-steroid drugs inhibiting the effects of natural steroid hormones.
 To determine the correct answer,  I need to identify which choice accurately describes the nature of SARMs.  SARMs are indeed non-steroid drugs,  and their primary function is to selectively modulate the activity of androgen receptors,  which can either mimic the effects of natural steroid hormones or inhibit them,  depending on the specific SARM.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The β-oxidation of a molecule of palmitic acid,  CH3 (CH2 )14 CO2 H: Choices: a) yields 8  molecules of acetyl-CoA and some ATP and water.  b) yields 16  molecules of acetyl-CoA only.  c) yields carbon dioxide and water only.  d) does not involve oxygen.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the β-oxidation process.  β-oxidation is a metabolic pathway that breaks down fatty acids into acetyl-CoA units.  In this case,  we are dealing with palmitic acid,  a 16-carbon fatty acid.

Next,  I need to determine how many rounds of β-oxidation are required to fully break down palmitic acid.  Each round of β-oxidation removes two carbons from the fatty acid chain,  producing one acetyl-CoA molecule and a new fatty acid with two fewer carbons.  Since palmitic acid has 16 carbons,  it will require 8  rounds of β-oxidation to be fully broken down.

Now,  I need to consider the products of each round of β-oxidation.  In each round,  one acetyl-CoA molecule is produced.  Since there are 8  rounds,  8  molecules of acetyl-CoA are produced.

Finally,  I need to consider any additional products of the β-oxidation process.  During the β-oxidation process,  ATP is consumed and water is produced as byproducts.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which products of ADP degradation increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports?  Choices: a) Ammonia,  hypoxanthine and uric acid.  b) Ammonia,  urea and uric acid.  c) Ammonia,  urea and creatinine.  d) Ammonia,  urea and creatine.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the process of ADP degradation.  ADP (adenosine diphosphate) is a molecule that is degraded to AMP (adenosine monophosphate) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) during energy production in cells.  The inorganic phosphate can be further degraded to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate).
 Next,  I need to consider the products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration in the blood during multiple sprint sports.  During intense exercise,  the body produces more inorganic phosphate,  which can be used to produce ATP.  This leads to an increase in the concentration of inorganic phosphate in the blood.
 Now,  I need to consider the choices given.  Choice a) Ammonia,  hypoxanthine and uric acid are products of purine metabolism,  not ADP degradation.  Choice b) Ammonia,  urea and uric acid also include uric acid,  which is not directly related to ADP degradation.  Choice c) Ammonia,  urea and creatinine includes urea,  which is a product of amino acid metabolism,  not ADP degradation.  Choice d) Ammonia,  urea and creatine includes ammonia and urea,  but creatine is not a product of ADP degradation.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The optimum position for performing CPR is to position the patient: Choices: a) in a semi-recumbent posture.  b) tilted to the left to keep the heart perfused.  c) flat on a firm surface.  d) on the floor with the legs raised.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the purpose of CPR.  CPR is performed to maintain blood flow to the brain and other vital organs by pumping blood.
 Next,  I need to consider the position that allows for the most effective blood flow.  The patient should be positioned in a way that allows for the best possible circulation of blood.
 Finally,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  a) in a semi-recumbent posture is not optimal because it may restrict blood flow.  b) tilted to the left to keep the heart perfused is not ideal because it may cause the heart to stop pumping.  d) on the floor with the legs raised is not ideal because it may cause the patient to slide off the surface.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise normally takes: Choices: a) about 10  seconds.  b) about 30  seconds.  c) about 1  minute.  d) about 4  minutes.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the context of very high intensity exercise.  During such intense exercise,  the body relies heavily on phosphocreatine stores for immediate energy.
 Next,  I need to understand the time it takes for phosphocreatine to resynthesize.  Phosphocreatine resynthesis is a relatively fast process compared to other energy systems.
 Finally,  I need to match the given choices with the appropriate time frame for resynthesis.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: What type of joint is the elbow?  Choices: a) Ball and socket joint.  b) Fused joint.  c) Synovial hinge joint.  d) Plain joint.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the type of joint that the elbow is.  The elbow is a joint that allows for flexion and extension,  meaning it can bend and straighten.
 Next,  I will consider the choices given.  A ball and socket joint allows for movement in multiple directions,  which is not the case for the elbow.  A fused joint is not a type of joint,  it refers to a joint that has been surgically or naturally fused.  A synovial hinge joint allows for movement in one plane,  with limited movement in other planes,  which fits the description of the elbow.  A plain joint allows for limited movement,  which is not specific to the elbow.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A hypertonic solution is: Choices: a) a solution that has a higher concentration of solutes than the normal human cell.  b) a solution that blocks off enteral tubes easily.  c) a solution that has a lower concentration of solutes than the normal human cell.  d) a solution with a high fibre content.  
 Output:
 First, I need to understand the definition of a hypertonic solution. A hypertonic solution is a solution that has a higher concentration of solutes than another solution, typically compared to the normal human cell.
 Next, I need to match this definition to the given choices. Choice a) states that a hypertonic solution has a higher concentration of solutes than the normal human cell, which aligns with the definition.
 Choice b) talks about a solution that blocks off enteral tubes easily, which is not related to the concentration of solutes. Choice c) states that a hypertonic solution has a lower concentration of solutes than the normal human cell, which is the opposite of the definition. Choice d) mentions a solution with a high fiber content, which is not related to the concentration of solutes.
 Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of these is not necessary when examining the jugular venous pulse?  Choices: a) Patient's neck muscles should be relaxed b) Timing the pulsation with the radial pulse c) Good lighting d) Patient lying at 45  degree angle 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what the jugular venous pulse is.  It is a pulse that can be felt on the side of the neck,  usually over the jugular vein.
 Next,  I need to consider the necessary conditions for examining this pulse.  Good lighting is important to see the veins and assess the color and size of the pulse.
 Timing the pulsation with the radial pulse can help in understanding the relationship between the two pulses.
 Patient's neck muscles should be relaxed to easily feel the pulse.
 Patient lying at 45 degree angle is not a necessary condition for examining the jugular venous pulse.  It is more of a positioning for palpating the carotid artery.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The maximum sustainable power: Choices: a) usually remains constant during a race.  b) declines with the distance of the race.  c) is improved by a high fat diet.  d) is inversely related to muscle glycogen content.  
 Output:
 First, let's consider the concept of maximum sustainable power in the context of a race. This refers to the maximum power output that an athlete can maintain over a prolonged period of time, typically during a race.

Next, let's evaluate each choice:
a) Maximum sustainable power usually remains constant during a race - This statement is not entirely accurate, as factors such as fatigue, external conditions, and individual physical condition can affect power output.
b) Declines with the distance of the race - This statement is more accurate, as the maximum sustainable power tends to decrease as the race distance increases due to factors like fatigue and energy depletion.
c) Is improved by a high fat diet - This statement is not necessarily true, as the type of diet can impact performance, but it does not directly improve maximum sustainable power.
d) Is inversely related to muscle glycogen content - This statement is partially true, as muscle glycogen serves as a primary energy source during prolonged exercise. As muscle glycogen levels decrease, the reliance on other energy sources (like fat) increases, which can affect maximum sustainable power.

Based on the analysis, the most accurate statement is that maximum sustainable power declines with the distance of the race (choice b). Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Fast-twitch fibres contain: Choices: a) a relatively large number of mitochondria and low ATPase activity.  b) a relatively small number of mitochondria and low ATPase activity.  c) a relatively small number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity.  d) a relatively large number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the characteristics of fast-twitch fibres.  These fibres are designed for short bursts of high-intensity activity,  and they rely on anaerobic metabolism to produce energy quickly.
 Next,  I need to consider the options given.  Option a suggests that fast-twitch fibres have a large number of mitochondria and low ATPase activity,  which is not consistent with their anaerobic metabolism.  Option b suggests a small number of mitochondria and low ATPase activity,  which also does not fit the characteristics of fast-twitch fibres.  Option c suggests a small number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity,  which could be a possibility,  as ATPase activity is related to energy production.  Option d suggests a large number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity,  which is not consistent with the anaerobic metabolism of fast-twitch fibres.
 To determine the correct answer,  I need to consider the role of mitochondria and ATPase activity in energy production.  Mitochondria are the site of aerobic respiration,  and ATPase activity is related to the production of ATP,  the energy currency of the cell.  Fast-twitch fibres rely on anaerobic metabolism,  which does not involve mitochondria.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The rate of blood lactate accumulation is determined by: Choices: a) the rate of muscle lactate production and the rate of muscle lactate efflux.  b) the rate of anaerobic glycolysis.  c) the rate of muscle glucose uptake.  d) the difference between the rate of lactate appearance and the rate of lactate clearance.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what determines the rate of blood lactate accumulation.  Blood lactate accumulation is related to the balance between lactate production and lactate clearance.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  Choice a) mentions the rate of muscle lactate production and the rate of muscle lactate efflux, which are related to the balance of lactate in the blood.  Choice b) refers to the rate of anaerobic glycolysis, which is a source of lactate production.  Choice c) refers to muscle glucose uptake, which is not directly related to lactate accumulation.  Choice d) mentions the difference between lactate appearance and lactate clearance, which is also related to the balance of lactate in the blood.
 To determine the correct answer,  I need to find the choice that best represents the factors that determine the rate of blood lactate accumulation.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: The enzymes of glycolysis are located in the: Choices: a) mitochondrion.  b) nucleus.  c) cytoplasm.  d) lysosomes.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the location where glycolysis occurs.  Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that occurs in the cell,  and it is the first step in the breakdown of glucose to produce energy.
 Next,  I need to eliminate the choices that are not part of the cell.  The nucleus is the control center of the cell,  but it is not where glycolysis occurs.  Lysosomes are organelles that contain digestive enzymes,  but they are not the site of glycolysis.
 This leaves me with the mitochondrion and the cytoplasm.  Mitochondria are the site of cellular respiration,  but glycolysis is the first step of this process,  which occurs in the cytoplasm.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The energy released from the breakdown of the high-energy phosphates,  ATP and phosphocreatine,  can sustain maximal exertion exercise for about: Choices: a) 1 -2  seconds.  b) 5 -10  seconds.  c) 30 -40  seconds.  d) 50 -60  seconds.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the energy sources mentioned: ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and phosphocreatine.  ATP is the primary energy source for muscle contractions,  providing energy for short bursts of activity.  Phosphocreatine can quickly replenish ATP levels,  allowing for a brief increase in energy output.

Next,  I need to evaluate the duration of energy provided by these sources.  ATP can sustain maximal exertion for a very short period,  as it is quickly used up during intense exercise.  Phosphocreatine can provide additional energy to replenish ATP levels for a slightly longer period.

Considering the choices given,  the energy released from the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine can sustain maximal exertion exercise for about 1-2 seconds.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Prosthetic groups are: Choices: a) required by all enzymes in the cell.  b) loosely bound to enzymes via hydrogen bonds.  c) sites on the enzyme molecule that permit allosteric modification of enzyme activity.  d) tightly bound to enzymes and are required for their activity.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what prosthetic groups are.  Prosthetic groups are non-polypeptide groups that are tightly bound to enzymes and are required for their activity.  So,  option d) is correct.  Therefore,  the answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true in peripheral neuropathy?  Choices: a) Sensory loss is demonstrated in a stocking distribution b) The tone is increased bilaterally in the legs c) Reflexes are very brisk with reinforcement d) Weakness is more marked proximally than distally 
 Output:
 First, let's analyze each option:
 a) Sensory loss is demonstrated in a stocking distribution - This is true in peripheral neuropathy, as it often affects the peripheral nerves, leading to a loss of sensation in a pattern similar to a stocking or glove.
 b) The tone is increased bilaterally in the legs - This is not typically true in peripheral neuropathy, as the condition usually does not cause increased muscle tone.
 c) Reflexes are very brisk with reinforcement - This is not typically true in peripheral neuropathy, as the condition usually does not cause brisk reflexes.
 d) Weakness is more marked proximally than distally - This is not typically true in peripheral neuropathy, as the condition usually affects the distal parts of the body more than the proximal parts.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true about involuntary movements in the arm?  Choices: a) Alcohol makes the tremor of benign essential tremor worse b) Hemiballismus is due to a stroke causing paralysis of the distal half of the arm c) A 'milkmaid' grip is sometimes found in dystonia d) Writer's cramp is an example of a focal dystonia 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze each choice and determine if it is true or false.
 a) Alcohol can indeed make the tremor of benign essential tremor worse,  as it is a central nervous system depressant that can exacerbate the tremor.
 b) Hemiballismus is not due to a stroke causing paralysis of the distal half of the arm.  Hemiballismus is a sudden,  involuntary,  contralateral,  abrupt flexion of the muscles of the upper and lower limbs,  head,  and trunk,  and is not related to paralysis.
 c) A 'milkmaid' grip is sometimes found in dystonia.  This is true,  as dystonia can cause abnormal muscle contractions and postures,  including the 'milkmaid' grip.
 d) Writer's cramp is an example of a focal dystonia.  This is also true,  as writer's cramp is a specific type of dystonia that affects the hand and forearm while writing.

Therefore,  the correct answers are {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of these options is not recognized as a cause of chronic cough?  Choices: a) Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease b) Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors c) Long-term smoking d) Sodium valproate

 First,  I need to identify the causes of chronic cough.  Chronic cough can be caused by various factors,  including infections,  allergies,  and underlying medical conditions.
 Next,  I will go through the options and determine which one is not typically recognized as a cause of chronic cough.
 a) Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can cause chronic cough,  as stomach acid backing up into the esophagus and throat can irritate the airways.
 b) Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are medications used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure,  and they can cause a dry cough as a side effect,  but they are not a direct cause of chronic cough.
 c) Long-term smoking is a well-known cause of chronic cough,  as the smoke damages the airways and can lead to a persistent cough.
 d) Sodium valproate is an anticonvulsant medication that can cause a dry cough as a side effect,  but it is not a direct cause of chronic cough.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following is recommended for cleaning the mouth?  Choices: a) Hydrogen peroxide.  b) Water.  c) Lemon and glycerine swabs.  d) Normal saline.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the purpose of cleaning the mouth,  which is to remove bacteria and maintain oral hygiene.
 Next,  I will evaluate each option based on its effectiveness in cleaning the mouth.  Hydrogen peroxide has antimicrobial properties and can be used to kill bacteria,  making it a good option.  Water is essential for rinsing but does not have antimicrobial properties.  Lemon and glycerine swabs can be used for cleaning,  but they are not as effective as hydrogen peroxide.  Normal saline is used for nasal irrigation and does not have antimicrobial properties for cleaning the mouth.
 Therefore,  the recommended option for cleaning the mouth is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: As a general principle what is the best approach to the use of analgesic drugs following surgery?  Choices: a) Give drugs only 'as required'.  b) Give drugs regularly with provision for additional 'as required' pain relief for breakthrough pain.  c) Use long-acting drugs twice daily.  d) Give only when pain scores are high.  
 Output:
 First,  we need to consider the general principles of pain management after surgery.  The goal is to provide adequate pain relief without causing excessive sedation or dependence on the analgesic drugs.
 Next,  we need to understand the different types of pain relief.  Regularly administered analgesics can help manage background pain,  while 'as required' analgesics are used for breakthrough pain.
 Finally,  we need to evaluate the choices given.  Choice a) focuses on 'as required' pain relief,  which is not ideal because it does not address background pain.  Choice b) suggests a balanced approach,  with regular analgesics and 'as required' for breakthrough pain.  Choice c) focuses on long-acting drugs,  which may not be the best option for all patients.  Choice d) focuses on pain scores,  which may not be practical or effective for all patients.
 Based on these considerations,  the best approach is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following best describes nociceptive pain?  Choices: a) Pain resulting from actual or potential tissue damage,  which causes the release of chemical mediators that stimulate nerve fibres to initiate pain signals to the brain.  b) Pain resulting from pressure upon a nerve or group of nerves.  c) A disorder of a specific nerve or group of nerves resulting in the release of abnormal pain signals.  d) Pain resulting from a disorder of the central nervous system,  i. e.  following a cerebral vascular accident.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what nociceptive pain is.  Nociceptive pain is pain that is caused by the activation of nociceptors,  which are sensory nerve fibers that respond to potentially damaging or injurious stimuli.
 Next,  I need to look at the choices and find the one that best describes this definition.  Choice a) states that nociceptive pain is pain resulting from actual or potential tissue damage,  which stimulates nerve fibers to initiate pain signals to the brain.  This matches the definition of nociceptive pain.
 Choice b) describes neuropathic pain,  which is pain resulting from pressure upon a nerve or group of nerves.  This is not the same as nociceptive pain.
 Choice c) describes a disorder of a specific nerve or group of nerves,  which is also not the same as nociceptive pain.
 Choice d) describes central pain,  which is pain resulting from a disorder of the central nervous system.  This is not the same as nociceptive pain.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Complete the following: A variation of serial peak flow readings over a two week period are considered diagnostic in .  .  .  Choices: a) .  .  .  asthma.  b) .  .  .  COPD.  c) .  .  .  pneumonia.  d) .  .  .  tuberculosis.  
 Output:
 First, let's consider what serial peak flow readings are. Serial peak flow readings are measurements of the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) taken at regular intervals. PEFR is a measure of how well air moves out of the lungs.

Next, let's consider the context of the question. The question is asking about a diagnostic consideration based on variations in serial peak flow readings over a two-week period.

Now, let's evaluate each choice:

a) Asthma: Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that affects the airways, leading to difficulty in breathing and variability in PEFR. Variations in serial peak flow readings are a common indicator of asthma.

b) COPD: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is another chronic respiratory condition, but it typically results in a gradual decline in PEFR over time rather than short-term variability.

c) Pneumonia: Pneumonia is an infection that causes inflammation in the lungs, which can affect PEFR. However, the variability in serial peak flow readings would not be as diagnostic for pneumonia as it is for asthma.

d) Tuberculosis: Tuberculosis is a lung infection, but it does not typically cause variability in PEFR over a short period.

Based on the evaluation, the most appropriate answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Under which circumstances would you not use a catheter valve?  Choices: a) If the patient is post-operative.  b) If the patient chooses it.  c) If the patient has bladder sensation.  d) If urine does not need to be measured.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the purpose of a catheter valve.  A catheter valve is used to control the flow of urine from the bladder to the outside.  It is typically used in post-operative patients,  when the patient chooses to have it,  when the patient does not have bladder sensation,  and when urine needs to be measured.
 Next,  I need to identify the circumstance under which a catheter valve would not be used.  This would be the case when urine does not need to be measured.  In this situation,  the catheter valve is not necessary for the purpose of controlling the flow of urine.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true of Paget's Disease?  Choices: a) Bowing of a long bone is a characteristic feature b) Spinal cord compression is a common complication c) Heart failure is not a recognized complication d) Pathological fractures are not a feature 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the characteristics of Paget's Disease. It is a bone disorder that affects the bone remodeling process, leading to bone pain, swelling, and deformities.

Next, let's evaluate each choice in relation to Paget's Disease:
a) Bowing of a long bone is a characteristic feature - This is true, as Paget's Disease can cause deformities in bones, including bowing of long bones.
b) Spinal cord compression is a common complication - This is also true, as Paget's Disease can lead to bone overgrowth and compression of the spinal cord.
c) Heart failure is not a recognized complication - This is false, as Paget's Disease can affect the bone structure of the heart, leading to heart failure in some cases.
d) Pathological fractures are not a feature - This is false, as Paget's Disease can weaken the bones, making them more susceptible to fractures.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Your first action following confirmation of cardiac arrest is to: Choices: a) ensure the emergency team/services are called.  b) give two rescue breaths.  c) give 30  chest compressions.  d) check the notes to see if the patient has a DNAR order.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the immediate priorities in managing cardiac arrest.  The first action should be to initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).  This involves a combination of chest compressions and rescue breaths.
 Next,  I need to consider the order of these actions.  Chest compressions are typically performed before rescue breaths because they help maintain blood flow to the brain and other vital organs.  So,  the first action should be to give 30  chest compressions.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: What is an urgent reason for catheterizing a patient?  Choices: a) Acute urinary retention.  b) Urinary tract infection.  c) Incontinence.  d) Because they asked.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the most urgent reason for catheterizing a patient.  Among the choices,  acute urinary retention is a condition where a patient experiences sudden and involuntary loss of bladder control, leading to a buildup of urine in the bladder.
 This condition can cause severe discomfort and, if left untreated,  can lead to serious complications such as kidney damage or urinary tract infections.  Therefore,  it is an urgent reason for catheterization.
 The other options,  while also valid reasons for catheterization,  are not as urgent as acute urinary retention.  Urinary tract infections,  incontinence,  and catheterization due to a patient's request are less immediate concerns compared to the risk of complications from acute urinary retention.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true?  Choices: a) Increasing the protein intake above 3  grams per kg body mass per day will stimulate muscle growth and increase strength.  b) Creatine supplements can increase muscle strength and power.  c) Amino acid supplements can increase muscle strength and power.  d) Muscle damage is induced by shortening contractions.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze each statement and compare it to the current scientific evidence.
 a) Increasing the protein intake above 3  grams per kg body mass per day will stimulate muscle growth and increase strength.  This statement is not entirely accurate.  While adequate protein intake is important for muscle repair and growth,  there is no clear evidence that increasing protein intake above 3  grams per kg body mass per day will have a significant impact on muscle growth or strength.  So,  this statement is not true.
 b) Creatine supplements can increase muscle strength and power.  This statement is true.  Scientific studies have shown that creatine supplementation can lead to improvements in muscle strength and power,  especially in resistance training.
 c) Amino acid supplements can increase muscle strength and power.  This statement is not entirely true.  While certain amino acids,  such as leucine,  have been shown to have anabolic effects,  there is no clear evidence that general amino acid supplements can significantly increase muscle strength and power.
 d) Muscle damage is induced by shortening contractions.  This statement is true.  Muscle damage is a normal part of the muscle growth process and is induced by both stretching and shortening contractions.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Who has legal responsibility for a patient's care during hospital admission,  stay,  and discharge?  Choices: a) The named nurse.  b) The named consultant.  c) The ward manager.  d) The GP.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the legal responsibility for a patient's care during hospital admission,  stay,  and discharge.  This responsibility typically falls under the care of the healthcare professionals directly involved with the patient's treatment.
 Next,  I will consider the choices provided.  a) The named nurse,  b) The named consultant,  c) The ward manager,  and d) The GP.
 The ward manager oversees the overall functioning of the ward but does not have direct responsibility for the patient's care.  The GP is responsible for the patient's care outside the hospital.  The named nurse may be involved in the care but is not the primary responsible party.  The named consultant,  however,  is typically the healthcare professional who has the primary responsibility for the patient's care,  including making treatment decisions and monitoring the patient's condition.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Endurance training increases the muscle's capacity to: Choices: a) contract faster.  b) break down phosphocreatine.  c) burn fat and carbohydrate.  d) generate energy anaerobically.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what endurance training is.  Endurance training is a type of exercise that improves the body's ability to use oxygen efficiently during prolonged activity.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices and their implications.  a) contract faster refers to strength training,  not endurance.  b) break down phosphocreatine is a short-term energy source,  not directly related to endurance.  c) burn fat and carbohydrate is a metabolic process,  but it is not the primary focus of endurance training.  d) generate energy anaerobically is related to short-term, high-intensity activities,  not endurance.
 To find the correct answer,  I need to identify the choice that directly relates to the improvement of oxygen efficiency during prolonged activity.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: An action potential arriving at the motor endplate causes release of: Choices: a) acetylcholine which traverses the neuromuscular junction.  b) sodium ions which binds to sodium receptors on the muscle membrane.  c) calcium ions which initiate an action potential along the muscle fibre.  d) noradrenaline which increases muscle metabolic activity.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what an action potential is.  An action potential is a rapid,  electrical change in the membrane potential of a cell,  which is typically initiated by the binding of neurotransmitters to receptors.
 Next,  I need to consider the context of the motor endplate.  The motor endplate is the site where a motor neuron communicates with a muscle fiber.
 Now,  I need to identify the correct neurotransmitter released at the motor endplate.  The neurotransmitter released at the motor endplate is acetylcholine.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Your patient has diabetes.  Why is this important?  Choices: a) These patients are more likely to bleed.  b) These patients are more likely to get urinary tract infections if their blood sugar is unstable.  c) These patients are more likely to have clear urine.  d) These patients are less likely to have catheter encrustation.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the impact of diabetes on the patient's health.  Diabetes is a condition where the body has a problem regulating blood sugar levels.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the choices based on the known effects of diabetes.  Diabetics are more likely to have unstable blood sugar levels, which can lead to complications such as infections.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: What is meant by the term 'passive movements'?  Choices: a) Movement with resistance,  stretching at end of range.  b) Movement without resistance,  stretching at end of range.  c) Movement with resistance,  stopping at end of range.  d) Movement without resistance,  stopping at end of range.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the term 'passive movements'.  Passive movements are movements that are performed without the active muscle contraction.  This means that the movement is being done by external forces,  not by the muscles themselves.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  Choice a) mentions resistance and stretching at the end of range,  which implies active muscle contraction.  Choice c) also mentions resistance and stopping at the end of range,  which also implies active muscle contraction.  Choice d) mentions no resistance and stopping at the end of range,  which could be a passive movement,  but stretching at the end of range is not mentioned,  so it is not the best choice.
 Choice b) mentions no resistance and stretching at the end of range,  which aligns with the definition of passive movements.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: What is a tracheostomy?

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a tracheostomy is.  A tracheostomy is a surgical procedure that creates an artificial airway by making an opening in the trachea.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given and determine which one correctly describes the location of the opening.  The trachea is a tube that carries air to and from the lungs, and the cricoid cartilage is a ring-shaped bone that supports the trachea.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true of haematemesis?  Choices: a) A low blood pressure (<90 mmHg systolic) and a tachycardia (>100 /min) are worrying features b) A pulse rate of 80 /min in a patient taking Bisoprolol is reassuring c) Abdominal pain is always present d) An alcohol history is not essential 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the definition of haematemesis. Haematemesis is the vomiting of blood.
 Now, let's analyze each choice:
 a) A low blood pressure (<90 mmHg systolic) and a tachycardia (>100 /min) are worrying features. This statement is true because low blood pressure and tachycardia can indicate a significant underlying cause, such as a bleeding gastrointestinal source.
 b) A pulse rate of 80 /min in a patient taking Bisoprolol is reassuring. This statement is not necessarily true, as the pulse rate can be affected by other factors, and it does not directly relate to the presence of haematemesis.
 c) Abdominal pain is always present. This statement is not true because haematemesis can occur without abdominal pain, especially if the bleeding is from the upper gastrointestinal tract.
 d) An alcohol history is not essential. This statement is not true because alcohol is a common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and an alcohol history can be important in the evaluation of haematemesis.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true of rheumatoid arthritis?  Choices: a) Rheumatoid factor is present in 25 % of rheumatoid cases b) It is an example of an oligoarthropathy c) Anaemia is a common finding d) Heberden's nodes are a feature 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the characteristics of rheumatoid arthritis.  It is an autoimmune disease that affects the joints,  leading to inflammation and pain.
 Next,  I will analyze each choice to see if it is true of rheumatoid arthritis.
 a) Rheumatoid factor is present in 25 % of rheumatoid cases - This is incorrect.  Rheumatoid factor is present in about 70-90% of rheumatoid arthritis patients.
 b) It is an example of an oligoarthropathy - This is incorrect.  Rheumatoid arthritis is a polyarthropathy,  meaning it affects many joints.
 c) Anaemia is a common finding - This is true.  Rheumatoid arthritis can cause anaemia due to bone marrow infiltration and chronic blood loss.
 d) Heberden's nodes are a feature - This is incorrect.  Heberden's nodes are bony enlargements of the distal interphalangeal joints of the fingers,  which are more commonly seen in gout,  not rheumatoid arthritis.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Why should careful consideration be given to providing people aged over 65  with information sources that are internet based?  Choices: a) They may have difficulty reading the screen.  b) Less than 30 % of people over 65  years have access to the internet.  c) The internet is aimed at younger people.  d) They may not be able to type.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the potential challenges that people aged over 65  may face when using internet-based information sources.  One possible challenge is that they may have difficulty reading the screen due to vision problems.
 Next,  I need to consider the prevalence of internet access among people over 65.  The statement ""less than 30 % of people over 65  years have access to the internet"" suggests that a significant portion of this demographic may not have internet access, which is a valid concern.
 Finally,  I need to consider whether the internet is inherently aimed at younger people.  While it's true that many internet platforms and content are designed with younger users in mind, the internet itself is not limited to any specific age group, and there are resources and tools available for all ages.
 Based on these considerations,  the most important reason to provide people aged over 65  with information sources that are internet-based is that less than 30 % of people over 65  years have access to the internet (choice b).
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze each choice and determine if it is true or false about the carpal tunnel syndrome.
 a) It can be caused by rheumatoid arthritis - This is true,  as rheumatoid arthritis can cause inflammation in the wrist and hand, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome.
 b) It is caused by compression of the ulna nerve - This is false,  as the carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression of the median nerve, not the ulna nerve.
 c) It causes pain and tingling in the medial three and half digits - This is false,  as carpal tunnel syndrome causes pain and tingling in the lateral three and half digits, not the medial ones.
 d) Paraesthesia is worse during the day - This is false,  as paraesthesia (tingling or numbness) is usually worse at night due to increased pressure on the median nerve during sleep.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: How many CO2  and ATP molecules are formed during one complete turn of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle)?  Choices: a) 2 CO2  and 2 ATP b) 2 CO2  and 16 ATP c) 2 CO2  and 12 ATP d) 2 CO2  and 1 ATP 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the process of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle).  During one complete turn of the cycle,  two molecules of pyruvate are processed,  resulting in the production of two molecules of CO2.  Each pyruvate molecule produces one CO2 molecule.
 Next,  I need to consider the ATP production during the cycle.  For each turn of the cycle,  there is a net gain of 1 ATP molecule.  This is because the cycle generates ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation,  and the other high-energy molecules produced are used for further reactions in the cycle.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what the genome is.  The genome is the entire set of genetic information in an organism,  which includes all the DNA sequences of its chromosomes.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice in relation to the definition of the genome.
 a) the number of chromosomes found in the somatic cells of an organism - This choice refers to the number of chromosomes,  not the entire DNA sequence.
 b) the entire DNA sequence of an organism - This choice matches the definition of the genome,  as it includes all the DNA sequences of the organism's chromosomes.
 c) the entire list of proteins that an organism is capable of producing - This choice refers to the proteins,  not the genetic information.
 d) the DNA sequence of an entire chromosome - This choice refers to the DNA sequence of one chromosome,  not the entire set of genetic information.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Alterations in which neurotransmitters in the brain by pharmacological agents has been shown to influence fatigue development?  Choices: a) Acetyl choline and noradrenaline.  b) Dopamine and acetyl choline.  c) Glutamate and serotonin.  d) Dopamine and serotonin.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the question.  The question is asking which neurotransmitters in the brain are influenced by pharmacological agents and have been shown to influence fatigue development.
 Next,  I need to analyze the choices given.  Each choice lists two neurotransmitters.
 Now,  I need to recall or research which neurotransmitters are known to be influenced by pharmacological agents and have an impact on fatigue development.  Acetyl choline and noradrenaline are neurotransmitters that are influenced by pharmacological agents and have been shown to affect fatigue development.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: In all-out exercise such as sprinting the first fibre types to fatigue are the: Choices: a) Type I fibres.  b) Type Ia fibres.  c) Type IIa fibres.  d) Type IIX fibres.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the characteristics of the different fibre types.  Type I fibres,  also known as slow-twitch fibres,  are more resistant to fatigue and are used for endurance activities.  Type IIa fibres,  also known as fast-twitch fibres,  are more prone to fatigue and are used for explosive activities.  Type IIX fibres,  also known as fast-twitch fatigue-resistant fibres,  are less prone to fatigue than Type IIa fibres.
 In all-out exercise such as sprinting,  the energy is needed quickly and the muscles need to contract rapidly.  Type I fibres are not as efficient in this type of exercise because they are designed for endurance activities.  Type IIX fibres are more resistant to fatigue than Type IIa fibres,  but they are not as efficient in providing the rapid energy needed for sprinting.
 Therefore,  the first fibre types to fatigue in all-out exercise such as sprinting are the Type IIa fibres.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: The main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is: Choices: a) conversion to urea in the liver.  b) conversion to glucose in the heart.  c) excretion via the kidneys.  d) uptake and oxidation by other tissues.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the fate of lactate in the body.  Lactate is a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism in muscle cells.  When it leaves muscle tissue and enters the bloodstream,  it needs to be processed or removed from the body.
 Next,  I will consider each of the given choices and evaluate their validity.
 a) Conversion to urea in the liver: This is a possible fate of lactate, as the liver can convert lactate into glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis, and then glucose can be used to produce urea.
 b) Conversion to glucose in the heart: This is not a valid option, as the heart does not have the necessary enzymes to perform gluconeogenesis.
 c) Excretion via the kidneys: This is also a possible fate of lactate, as it can be excreted by the kidneys in the urine.
 d) Uptake and oxidation by other tissues: This is a valid option, as lactate can be taken up by other tissues, such as the liver or the brain, and oxidized back to pyruvate.

After evaluating each option,  I can conclude that the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is a combination of a) conversion to urea in the liver and d) uptake and oxidation by other tissues. Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a,d'}"
"Input: The most rapid method to resynthesize ATP during exercise is through: Choices: a) glycolysis.  b) phosphocreatine breakdown.  c) tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle).  d) glycogenolysis.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the rate at which ATP is resynthesized through each method.  Glycolysis generates ATP quickly but only produces a small amount,  so it's not the most rapid method.  Tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle) generates ATP at a slower rate,  as it involves multiple steps and requires energy to proceed.  Glycogenolysis,  the breakdown of glycogen to glucose,  generates ATP but at a slower rate than phosphocreatine breakdown.  Phosphocreatine breakdown is the most rapid method,  as it directly converts phosphocreatine into creatine and ATP,  providing a quick source of ATP.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true in a sensory assessment of the arm?  Choices: a) It is acceptable to test pain with a venepuncture needle b) Proprioception is appreciated via the same tracts as light touch c) It is best to test vibration sense with a 256  Hz tuning fork d) Impulses for pain travel principally up the dorsal columns 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider each choice and evaluate its accuracy in the context of a sensory assessment of the arm.
 a) It is acceptable to test pain with a venepuncture needle - This choice is not true.  Venepuncture needles are typically used for drawing blood and are not suitable for testing pain due to their large diameter and lack of fine control.
 b) Proprioception is appreciated via the same tracts as light touch - This choice is true.  Proprioception and light touch are both mediated by the same sensory nerve fibers, specifically the Aβ fibers.
 c) It is best to test vibration sense with a 256  Hz tuning fork - This choice is not true.  The optimal frequency for testing vibration sense is typically around 100-500 Hz, not 256 Hz.
 d) Impulses for pain travel principally up the dorsal columns - This choice is not true.  Pain impulses primarily travel through the ventral (anterior) columns, not the dorsal columns.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: The blood glucose concentration during 80 -90  minutes of intermittent high intensity exercise: Choices: a) frequently rises by 1  - 3  mM.  b) remains relatively unchanged.  c) frequently falls by 1  - 3  mM.  d) falls to hypoglycaemic levels.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the nature of intermittent high intensity exercise.  This type of exercise is characterized by short bursts of intense activity followed by brief periods of rest or low-intensity exercise.
 Next,  I need to consider the effect of high intensity exercise on blood glucose levels.  During high intensity exercise,  the body uses up its stores of glycogen and glucose to provide energy.  This leads to a decrease in blood glucose levels.
 Finally,  I need to compare the given choices to the information I have considered.  Option a) frequently rises by 1  - 3  mM does not match the effect of high intensity exercise on blood glucose levels.  Option b) remains relatively unchanged is also not consistent with the decrease in blood glucose levels during exercise.  Option c) frequently falls by 1  - 3  mM aligns with the decrease in blood glucose levels during high intensity exercise.  Option d) falls to hypoglycaemic levels is an extreme outcome and may not be the most accurate description of the typical response.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: One of the most common reasons for stoma formation is: Choices: a) irritable bowel syndrome.  b) haemorrhoids.  c) carcinoma.  d) bladder instability.

 Next,  I need to consider the possible reasons for stoma formation.  Stoma formation can be a result of surgery or an underlying medical condition.
 Now,  I will evaluate the choices given:
 a) Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder,  but it is not a direct cause of stoma formation.
 b) Haemorrhoids are swollen or inflamed blood vessels in the rectum or anus,  and they can cause stoma formation if they become very large or if they are not treated properly.
 c) Carcinoma is cancer,  and while cancer can cause changes in the skin or lead to the formation of a stoma, it is not a common reason for stoma formation.
 d) Bladder instability can lead to urine leakage,  which may require the formation of a stoma to manage the excess fluid.

Considering the information above,  the most common reason for stoma formation is haemorrhoids.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A surgical support can be used for: Choices: a) prolapsed stomas.  b) high output stomas.  c) herniation around the stoma.  d) retraction of the stoma.

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the typical urine output of a healthy individual at night.  On average,  a person may produce about 0.5 to 1 liter of urine per night.
 Next,  I need to consider the size of the catheter bag to accommodate this urine output without overflowing or being too small.  A 350 ml bag would be too small,  as it would not hold the typical urine output.  A 500 ml bag would also be too small.  A 1 L bag would be a reasonable size to accommodate the typical urine output.  A 2 L bag would be too large,  as it would be prone to overflowing.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Anaerobic metabolism refers to the generation of ATP: Choices: a) without the involvement of ADP.  b) without the use of glycogen.  c) without the use of oxygen.  d) in the absence of available oxygen.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what anaerobic metabolism is.  Anaerobic metabolism refers to a metabolic process that occurs without the use of oxygen.
 Next,  I need to identify which choice correctly describes anaerobic metabolism.  Choice a) states that ATP is generated without the involvement of ADP, which is not true for anaerobic metabolism.  Choice b) states that ATP is generated without the use of glycogen, which is not related to the process of anaerobic metabolism.  Choice c) states that ATP is generated without the use of oxygen, which is true for anaerobic metabolism.  Choice d) states that ATP is generated in the absence of available oxygen, which is also true for anaerobic metabolism.
 Therefore,  both choices c) and d) correctly describe anaerobic metabolism.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'c,d'}"
"Input: Approximately how many kJ of energy are expended if an athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake averages 3.0  l/min for 5  minutes of exercise?  Choices: a) 60  kJ b) 150  kJ c) 300  kJ d) 500  kJ 
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the total volume of oxygen consumed.  The athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake is 3.0  l/min,  and the exercise lasts for 5  minutes,  so the total volume is 3.0  l/min * 5  min = 15  liters.
 Next,  I need to convert the volume of oxygen to energy.  The energy content of oxygen is approximately 20.1  kJ/L.
 To find the total energy expended,  I multiply the volume of oxygen by the energy content: 15  L * 20.1  kJ/L = 301.5  kJ.
 Therefore,  the closest answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A patient has been on the operating table for four hours.  How long may it take for any pressure damage to be visible?  Choices: a) 12  hours.  b) 72  hours.  c) 24  hours.  d) 5  days.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the context of the question,  which is pressure damage in a patient who has been on the operating table.  Pressure damage,  such as pressure ulcers or bedsores,  can develop when a person is in the same position for extended periods.

Next,  I need to consider the time it takes for pressure damage to become visible.  Pressure ulcers develop in stages,  with the earliest stage being the skin being compressed and losing blood flow.  The visible stage of pressure ulcers typically occurs within 1-2 hours of being in the same position without change.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Eccrine and apocrine glands are both types of: Choices: a) sweat glands.  b) salivary glands.  c) chemoreceptors.  d) tear ducts.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the types of glands mentioned: eccrine and apocrine.
 Next,  I need to determine which category these glands belong to among the given choices.
 Eccrine glands are known to be the sweat glands that produce sweat to help regulate body temperature.
 Apocrine glands,  on the other hand,  are also glands that produce sweat,  but they are located in areas with a higher concentration of hair follicles and are involved in the production of body odor.
 Therefore,  both eccrine and apocrine glands are types of sweat glands.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true of the assessment of power in the arms?  Choices: a) Grade 3 /5  (MRC scale) represents movement of the arm only when gravity is eliminated b) Flexion at the elbow is produced by the triceps muscle c) The root value of shoulder abduction is C5  d) Grade 1 /5  power represents no movement or muscle contraction 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the MRC scale for muscle strength assessment.  Grade 3 on the MRC scale represents the ability to perform a task against gravity,  meaning the arm can move against the force of gravity.
 Next,  I need to consider the muscle that produces flexion at the elbow.  The flexor muscles,  not the triceps,  are responsible for elbow flexion.
 Then,  I need to look at the root value of shoulder abduction.  Shoulder abduction is primarily controlled by the deltoid muscles,  not by the C5 nerve root.
 Finally,  I need to consider the meaning of Grade 1 on the MRC scale.  Grade 1 represents the presence of a muscle contraction,  but without any movement.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

"Input: The low intake of carbohydrate in the diet: Choices: a) does not influence exercise performance in events lasting less than 10  minutes.  b) affects the resting muscle pH.  c) may impair high intensity exercise performance.  d) results in greater reliance on muscle glycogen during exercise.  
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the role of carbohydrates in the body.  Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy,  and they are broken down into glucose,  which is then used by the muscles for energy.
 Next,  we need to consider the duration of the exercise.  Events lasting less than 10  minutes are typically powered by the body's glycogen stores,  which are primarily stored in the muscles.
 Now,  we need to evaluate the choices in relation to the information we have.  Choice a) suggests that low carbohydrate intake does not influence exercise performance in events lasting less than 10  minutes,  which is not accurate because the body relies on glycogen stores for short duration events.
 Choice b) states that low carbohydrate intake affects resting muscle pH,  which is not directly related to exercise performance in short duration events.
 Choice c) suggests that low carbohydrate intake may impair high intensity exercise performance,  which is a possibility because high intensity exercise requires a continuous supply of glucose,  which may be limited without adequate carbohydrate intake.
 Choice d) states that low carbohydrate intake results in greater reliance on muscle glycogen during exercise,  which is accurate because the body will attempt to use the available glycogen stores for energy.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Phophocreatine resynthesis during recovery from exercise is inhibited by: Choices: a) an excess of creatine.  b) hyperventilation.  c) an excess of oxygen.  d) a lack of oxygen.

 First,  I need to understand what oedema is.  Oedema is a medical condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the body's tissues.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  a) excessive intravascular fluid refers to fluid within the blood vessels, which is not the cause of oedema.  b) excessive extravascular fluid refers to fluid outside the blood vessels, which is the cause of oedema.  c) excessive intracranial fluid is a specific type of oedema but not the general definition.  d) excessive necrotic cells is not related to the accumulation of fluid in tissues.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Why should the short-acting bronchodilator be taken first?  Choices: a) It works to dilate the airways quickly,  allowing better deposition of other medications.  b) They are colour-coded.  c) It is warmer than the others.  d) It is less moist than the others.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the purpose of a short-acting bronchodilator.  The primary function of a short-acting bronchodilator is to provide quick relief from symptoms of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by relaxing the muscles in the airways and opening them up.
 Next,  I need to consider the context of taking multiple medications together. When multiple medications are taken together,  it is beneficial to start with a short-acting bronchodilator because it works to dilate the airways quickly,  allowing better deposition of other medications. This ensures that the other medications can be more effectively delivered to the airways and provide their intended therapeutic effect.
 The other options,  such as colour-coding or temperature,  do not directly relate to the effectiveness of the medications or the purpose of taking a short-acting bronchodilator first.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following is true about an intention tremor?  Choices: a) It is worse at rest b) It is caused by Parkinson's Disease c) It is indicative of a cerebellar lesion d) Dyscalculia is a common association 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what an intention tremor is.  An intention tremor is a type of tremor that occurs when a person is about to perform a voluntary movement.
 Next,  I will evaluate each choice based on the characteristics of an intention tremor.  An intention tremor is typically worse when the person is at rest and is often caused by a cerebellar lesion.  Parkinson's Disease can cause a different type of tremor, not specifically intention tremor.  Dyscalculia is not a common association with intention tremor.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 Next, I will evaluate the given choices. Choice a) mentions protein transporters called GLUT4, which are indeed responsible for glucose transport in muscle cells. Choice b) states that glucose transport is only possible in the presence of insulin, which is not entirely accurate, as GLUT4 can also transport glucose in the absence of insulin, but with reduced efficiency. Choice c) refers to hexokinase, which is an enzyme involved in glucose metabolism, not transport. Choice d) mentions monocarbynic acid transporters, which are not responsible for glucose transport in muscle cells.
 Based on this analysis, the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Oxygen is used: Choices: a) in glycolysis.  b) in the conversion of fatty acids to acetyl CoA.  c) in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle).  d) in glycogenolysis.

 First,  I need to identify which process requires oxygen.  Oxygen is not used in anaerobic processes, but it is used in aerobic processes.
 Next,  I will go through the choices one by one:
 a) In glycolysis,  oxygen is not required.  Glycolysis can occur in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
 b) In the conversion of fatty acids to acetyl CoA,  oxygen is not required.  This process is part of beta-oxidation,  which can occur in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
 c) In the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle),  oxygen is required.  The cycle is part of cellular respiration,  which is an aerobic process.  Oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain,  which is a key step in the cycle.
 d) In glycogenolysis,  oxygen is not required.  Glycogenolysis is the breakdown of glycogen into glucose,  and it can occur in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Measuring the blood pressure in an arm that is above the level of the heart will: Choices: a) accurately estimate the blood pressure.  b) overestimate the blood pressure.  c) cause an auscultatory gap.  d) underestimate the blood pressure.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the physics of blood pressure.  Blood pressure is the force exerted by blood on the walls of blood vessels.  It is highest when the heart is pumping blood into the arteries and lowest when the heart is at rest between beats.
 When measuring blood pressure in an arm that is above the level of the heart,  the cuff used to measure the pressure is placed on the upper arm and inflated to compress the brachial artery.  The cuff is then slowly deflated while listening for the first and fifth heart sounds, which indicate the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively.
 If the arm is above the level of the heart,  the blood in the veins of the arm will be higher than the blood pressure in the arteries.  This means that when the cuff is inflated,  it will not compress the arterial blood pressure as much as it would if the arm were at the same level as the heart.
 Therefore,  measuring the blood pressure in an arm that is above the level of the heart will result in an overestimate of the blood pressure.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: When you are taking a musculoskeletal history which of the following is true?  Choices: a) Drugs may be implicated in the causation of gout b) A history of diarrhoea is not relevant c) Difficulty rising from a chair is diagnostic of polymyalgic rheumatica d) Joint stiffness of 5  minutes duration suggests an arthropathy 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the relevance of each choice to the musculoskeletal history.
 a) Drugs may be implicated in the causation of gout - This is true,  as certain drugs can cause gout,  a form of arthritis.
 b) A history of diarrhoea is not relevant - This is not necessarily true,  as diarrhoea can be a symptom of conditions that may affect the musculoskeletal system.
 c) Difficulty rising from a chair is diagnostic of polymyalgic rheumatica - This is not true,  as difficulty rising from a chair could be due to various reasons unrelated to polymyalgic rheumatica.
 d) Joint stiffness of 5  minutes duration suggests an arthropathy - This is true,  as joint stiffness of that duration can be indicative of an arthropathy.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Why are male patients advised to take their own electric razor to hospital?  Choices: a) For patient comfort.  b) To make hospital as familiar as possible.  c) To minimize risk of cross-infection.  d) To allow shaving at a time convenient to the patient.  
 Output:
 First,  consider the purpose of electric razors in the context of hospital visits.  They are used for shaving.
 Next,  think about the reasons for patients to bring their own razors to the hospital.  It could be for personal preference,  to avoid the risk of cross-infection,  or to have control over the timing of shaving.
 Finally,  compare the given choices with the possible reasons.  Choice c) To minimize risk of cross-infection is a valid reason for bringing one's own electric razor to the hospital.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which organ secretes insulin?  Choices: a) The gastric parietal cells.  b) The pancreas.  c) The walls of the large intestine.  d) The autonomic nervous system.  
 Output:
 First, I need to identify the organ that secretes insulin. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels, and it is produced by the pancreas.
 Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: When teaching a patient inhaler technique,  how will you ensure that a large proportion of the drug reaches the lower airways?  Choices: a) Ask them to take lots of small,  quick breaths in before using the inhaler.  b) Ask them to breathe normally when using the inhaler.  c) Ask them to perform the procedure as quickly as they can.  d) Ask them to hold their breath at the end of the inspiration on using the inhaler.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the goal of the inhaler technique.  The goal is to ensure that a large proportion of the drug reaches the lower airways,  where it is needed to treat conditions like asthma.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices and their effects on drug delivery.  Choice a) suggests taking small,  quick breaths,  which may not allow enough time for the drug to reach the lower airways.
 Choice b) suggests breathing normally,  which may not maximize drug delivery to the lower airways.
 Choice c) suggests performing the procedure quickly,  which may not allow enough time for the drug to reach the lower airways.
 Choice d) suggests holding the breath at the end of the inspiration,  which can help maximize drug delivery to the lower airways by keeping the drug in the airways longer.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Why should a patient stand or sit as upright as possible when recording a peak flow rate?  Choices: a) To ensure best lung expansion and accuracy and consistency of readings.  b) This is the most comfortable position to perform any breathing test.  c) The counter on the meter will not move if the patient is lying down.  d) To ensure that their technique can be observed easily.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the purpose of recording a peak flow rate.  The peak flow rate is a measure of how well air can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs,  and it is used to assess lung function and to monitor asthma control.
 Next,  I need to think about the factors that can affect the accuracy of the measurement.  Standing or sitting upright helps to ensure that the lungs are fully expanded,  which in turn helps to provide an accurate and consistent reading.
 Finally,  I need to compare the given choices to the factors that affect accuracy.  Choice a) explains the importance of lung expansion and the need for consistent readings,  which is relevant to the accuracy of the measurement.  Choice b) focuses on comfort,  which is not directly related to the accuracy of the measurement.  Choice c) is incorrect because the meter's counter should still move regardless of the patient's position.  Choice d) is partially correct,  as observing the technique is important,  but it does not directly address the issue of lung expansion and accuracy.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Why might a patient need a tracheostomy?  Choices: a) To repair vocal cords after paralysis.  b) To aid swallowing.  c) As an aid to weaning patients from a ventilator.  d) Prior to neck surgery.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the purpose of a tracheostomy.  A tracheostomy is a surgical procedure that creates an opening in the neck for the trachea,  allowing for easier breathing and ventilation.
 Next,  I need to consider each choice and determine if it aligns with the purpose of a tracheostomy.
 a) To repair vocal cords after paralysis: A tracheostomy does not repair vocal cords,  it provides an alternative airway.
 b) To aid swallowing: A tracheostomy does not aid swallowing,  it is not related to the swallowing process.
 c) As an aid to weaning patients from a ventilator: This choice aligns with the purpose of a tracheostomy,  as it allows for easier breathing and can aid in the process of weaning a patient from mechanical ventilation.
 d) Prior to neck surgery: A tracheostomy can be performed prior to neck surgery to provide an alternative airway and prevent damage to the trachea during the surgery.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: In general,  the higher the intensity of exercise,  the greater the proportional contribution of: Choices: a) aerobic energy production.  b) anaerobic energy production.  c) the TCA cycle (Krebs' cycle) to the production of ATP.  d) the electron transfer chain to the production of ATP.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the relationship between exercise intensity and energy production.  As exercise intensity increases,  the body relies more on anaerobic energy production,  since it can generate ATP quickly but is limited in duration.
 Next,  I need to consider the other options.  Aerobic energy production is more efficient but requires a sustained effort.  The TCA cycle and the electron transfer chain are parts of aerobic energy production,  so their contribution does not change proportionally with exercise intensity.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: What is the second commonest hospital acquired infection?  Choices: a) Urinary infection.  b) Wound infection.  c) Upper respiratory tract infection.  d) Ventilator-associated pneumonia.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the common hospital acquired infections.  These include urinary infection,  wound infection,  upper respiratory tract infection,  and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
 Next,  I need to determine the second commonest infection.  The most common hospital acquired infection is urinary infection.
 Therefore,  the second commonest hospital acquired infection is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Phosphocreatine in the muscle cell is found in: Choices: a) the mitochondria.  b) all subcellular compartments.  c) the sarcolemma.  d) the cytoplasm.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the location of phosphocreatine in the muscle cell.  Phosphocreatine is a high-energy molecule that is found in the vicinity of the  mitochondria,  which are the energy-producing organelles in cells.
 Next,  I can eliminate options that do not match this information.  Phosphocreatine is not found in the mitochondria itself (a),  nor is it present in all subcellular compartments (b).
 The sarcolemma is the plasma membrane of the muscle cell,  and phosphocreatine is not located there (c).
 This leaves option d) the cytoplasm,  which is the correct answer,  as phosphocreatine is found in the cytoplasm near the mitochondria.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The patient's self-report of pain is important because health care staff: Choices: a) can overestimate the intensity of the patient's pain.  b) underestimate the intensity of the patient's pain.  c) do not possess an objective way of assessing pain.  d) can use the information to prescribe and administer the least possible amount of pain relief.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the importance of the patient's self-report of pain.  The patient's perception of pain is subjective and unique to them.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  Choice a) suggests that health care staff might not accurately assess the patient's pain,  which is a possibility.  Choice b) also suggests a potential underestimation of the patient's pain by health care staff.  Choice c) highlights the lack of an objective method for assessing pain by health care staff.  Choice d) suggests that the patient's self-report can be used to tailor pain relief,  which is a practical application.
 The most relevant answer is that health care staff can underestimate the intensity of the patient's pain (b).  This is because pain is a subjective experience, and health care staff may not always accurately assess the patient's perception of pain.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
