"Input: The weight of an aspirin tablet is 300  milligrams according to the bottle label.  An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets,  obtains weights of 299,  300,  305,  302,  299,  301,  and 303,  and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim.  Which of the following gives the P-value of this test?  Choices: a) P(t > 1.54 ) with df = 6  b) 2 P(t > 1.54 ) with df = 6  c) P(t > 1.54 ) with df = 7  d) 2 P(t > 1.54 ) with df = 7  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the sample mean and sample standard deviation.  The sample mean is (299 + 300 + 305 + 302 + 299 + 301 + 303) ÷ 7 = 2109 ÷ 7 = 301.29  milligrams.
 Next,  I calculate the sample standard deviation.  The formula for sample standard deviation is: s = sqrt((sum((x - mean)^2)) / (n - 1)),  where x is the data point,  mean is the sample mean,  and n is the sample size.  Plugging in the values,  s = sqrt(((299 - 301.29)^2 + (300 - 301.29)^2 + (305 - 301.29)^2 + (302 - 301.29)^2 + (299 - 301.29)^2 + (301 - 301.29)^2 + (303 - 301.29)^2) / 6) = sqrt(12.96 / 6) = sqrt(2.16) = 1.47  milligrams.
 Now,  I need to calculate the t-score.  The formula for t-score is: t = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(n)),  where sample mean is the sample mean,  population mean is the claimed mean (300  milligrams),  sample standard deviation is the sample standard deviation,  and n is the sample size.  Plugging in the values,  t = (301.29 - 300) / (1.47 / sqrt(7)) = 1.29 / 0.49 = 2.63.
 To find the P-value,  I need to look up the t-score in a t-distribution table or use a calculator.  The degrees of freedom (df) is n - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6.  The t-score of 2.63 corresponds to a P-value of 2 P(t > 1.54) with df = 6.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The waiting times for a new roller coaster ride are normally distributed with a mean of 35  minutes and a standard deviation of 10  minutes.  If there are 150,000  riders the first summer,  which of the following is the shortest time interval associated with 100,000  riders?  Choices: a) 0  to 31.7  minutes b) 31.7  to 39.3  minutes c) 25.3  to 44.7  minutes d) 25.3  to 35  minutes 
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the z-score associated with 100,000  riders.  Since the total number of riders is 150,000,  the proportion of riders is 100,000  ÷ 150,000  = 2/3.
 Next,  I look up the z-score for a proportion of 2/3 in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator.  The z-score is approximately 0.968.
 Now,  I need to find the time interval that corresponds to this z-score.  To do this,  I use the formula: time = mean + (z-score * standard deviation).
 For the lower bound of the interval,  I have: time = 35  - (0.968 * 10) = 35  - 9.68 = 25.32  minutes.
 For the upper bound of the interval,  I have: time = 35  + (0.968 * 10) = 35  + 9.68 = 44.68  minutes.
 Therefore,  the shortest time interval associated with 100,000  riders is 25.3  to 44.7  minutes.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: All of the following statements are true for all discrete random variables except for which one?  Choices: a) The possible outcomes must all be numerical.  b) The possible outcomes must be mutually exclusive.  c) The mean (expected value) always equals the sum of the products obtained by multiplying each value by its corresponding probability.  d) Approximately 95 % of the outcomes will be within two standard deviations of the mean.  
 Output:
 First,  I will analyze each statement to determine which one is not true for all discrete random variables.
 a) The possible outcomes must all be numerical.  This statement is true for all discrete random variables, as they are defined as variables that can take on distinct and separate values, which are typically numerical.
 b) The possible outcomes must be mutually exclusive.  This statement is also true for all discrete random variables, as each outcome is distinct and cannot occur at the same time.
 c) The mean (expected value) always equals the sum of the products obtained by multiplying each value by its corresponding probability.  This statement is true for all discrete random variables, as the mean is calculated by summing the products of each value and its probability.
 d) Approximately 95 % of the outcomes will be within two standard deviations of the mean.  This statement is not true for all discrete random variables, as it refers to the empirical rule, which applies to normal distributions, not all discrete random variables.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following is a true statement about hypothesis testing?  Choices: a) If there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 10 % level,  then there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 5 % level.  b) Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered.  c) If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1 % level,  there is a 1 % chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.  d) The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the options and their implications.  Option a) states that if there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 10 % level,  then there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 5 % level.  This is true because a 10 % level is more lenient than a 5 % level,  so if the evidence is strong enough to reject at 10 %,  it will also be strong enough to reject at 5 %.
 Option b) suggests that whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered.  This is false because the choice between a one- or a two-sided test is typically made before the data are gathered based on the research question.
 Option c) claims that if a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1 % level,  there is a 1 % chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.  This is false because the 1 % level is the significance level,  not the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis.
 Option d) states that the power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.  This is true because the power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: An outlier is an observation that Choices: a) is seen more frequently than the other observations in the data set b) is seen less frequently than the other observations in the data set c) is always smaller than the other observations in the data set d) is significantly different from the other observations in the data set 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what an outlier is.  An outlier is a data point that is significantly different from other data points in a data set.
 Next,  I need to consider the given choices.  Choice a) is about frequency,  which is not the defining characteristic of an outlier.  Choice b) is about rarity,  which is also not the defining characteristic of an outlier.  Choice c) is about the value being smaller than other observations,  which is not the defining characteristic of an outlier.
 The only choice that matches the definition of an outlier is choice d),  which states that an outlier is significantly different from the other observations in the data set.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The principal of a school is interested in estimating the average income per family of her students.  She selects a random sample of students and collects information about their family income.  A 95  percent confidence interval computed from this data for the mean income per family is ($35,095,  $45,005 ).  Which of the following provides the best interpretation of this confidence interval?  Choices: a) 95  percent of the students in her school are from families whose income is between $35,095  and $45,005.  b) There is a 95 % probability that the families of all the students in this school have an income of between $35,095  and $45,005.  c) If we were to take another sample of the same size and compute a 95  percent confidence interval,  we would have a 95 % chance of getting the interval ($35,095,  $45,005 ).  d) There is a 95 % probability that the mean income per family in the school is between $35,095  and $45,005.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a confidence interval is.  A confidence interval is a range of values,  calculated from a sample,  that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence.  In this case,  the confidence interval is for the mean income per family of the students.
 Next,  I need to consider the given choices and eliminate those that do not correctly interpret the confidence interval.  Choice a) states that 95  percent of the students have families with incomes between $35,095  and $45,005,  which is incorrect because the confidence interval is about the mean income,  not the distribution of individual incomes.
 Choice b) states that there is a 95  percent probability that all families have incomes between $35,095  and $45,095,  which is also incorrect because the confidence interval is about the mean,  not the distribution of individual incomes.
 Choice c) states that if we took another sample and computed a 95  percent confidence interval,  we would have a 95  percent chance of getting the interval ($35,095,  $45,005 ),  which is incorrect because the confidence interval is about the population mean,  not the sample mean.
 Choice d) states that there is a 95  percent probability that the mean income per family in the school is between $35,095  and $45,005,  which is the correct interpretation of the confidence interval.
 Therefore,  the best interpretation of the confidence interval is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Researchers are conducting an experiment using a significance level of 0.05.  The null hypothesis is,  in fact,  false.  If they modify their experiment to use twice as many experimental units for each treatment,  which of the following would be true?  Choices: a) The probability of a Type I error and the probability of a Type II error would both decrease.  b) The probability of a Type I error and the power would both increase.  c) The probability of a Type II error and the power would both increase.  d) The probability of a Type I error would stay the same and the power would increase.  
 Output:
 First,  let's consider the effect of using twice as many experimental units for each treatment.  This increases the sample size,  which generally improves the ability to detect a true effect.
 Next,  let's consider the null hypothesis being false.  This means there is a true effect to detect.
 Now,  let's analyze the choices:
 a) The probability of a Type I error would not decrease with a larger sample size,  as it is determined by the significance level,  which remains the same.  The probability of a Type II error would decrease,  as the increased sample size improves the ability to detect a true effect.
 b) The probability of a Type I error would not decrease,  as explained above.  The power would increase,  as the increased sample size improves the ability to detect a true effect.
 c) The probability of a Type II error would decrease,  as explained above.  The power would increase,  as explained above.
 d) The probability of a Type I error would stay the same,  as explained above.  The power would increase,  as explained above.

"Input: The mean height of adult men is 70  inches,  with a standard deviation of four inches.  The mean height of adult women is 66  inches,  with a standard deviation of three inches.  Between a man with a height of 74  inches and a woman with a height of 70  inches,  who is more unusually tall within his or her respective sex?  Choices: a) It cannot be determined,  because the mean heights for the two groups are different.  b) It cannot be determined,  because the standard deviations of the heights for the two groups are different.  c) The man,  because he is 74  inches tall and the woman is only 70  inches tall.  d) The woman,  because her height is 1.33  standard deviations above the mean height of all women,  whereas the man’s height is only one standard deviation above the mean height of all men.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the z-scores for both the man and the woman.  The z-score is calculated as (height - mean height) ÷ standard deviation.
 For the man,  the z-score is (74  - 70  ) ÷ 4  = 1.
 For the woman,  the z-score is (70  - 66  ) ÷ 3  = 1.33.
 Now,  I compare the z-scores.  The woman's z-score is higher than the man's z-score,  which means her height is more unusual within her respective sex.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following is not true about t-distributions?  Choices: a) There are different t-distributions for different values of df (degrees of freedom).  b) t-distributions are bell-shaped and symmetric.  c) t-distributions always have mean 0  and standard deviation 1.  d) t-distributions are more spread out than the normal distribution.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze each statement about t-distributions.
 a) There are different t-distributions for different values of df (degrees of freedom).  This statement is true,  as the shape of the t-distribution changes with the number of degrees of freedom.
 b) t-distributions are bell-shaped and symmetric.  This statement is also true,  as t-distributions have a similar shape to the normal distribution.
 c) t-distributions always have mean 0  and standard deviation 1.  This statement is not true,  as t-distributions have a mean of 0,  but their standard deviation depends on the degrees of freedom.
 d) t-distributions are more spread out than the normal distribution.  This statement is true,  as t-distributions have greater variability for smaller degrees of freedom compared to the normal distribution.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: To study the effect of alcohol on reaction time,  subjects were randomly selected and given three beers to consume.  Their reaction time to a simple stimulus was measured before and after drinking the alcohol.  Which of the following is a correct statement?  Choices: a) This study was an observational study.  b) Lack of blocking makes this a poorly designed study.  c) The placebo effect is irrelevant in this type of study.  d) This study was an experiment in which the subjects were used as their own controls.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the type of study.  The subjects were randomly selected and given three beers to consume,  which means the researchers manipulated the condition of the subjects.  This indicates that it is an experiment.
 Next,  I need to consider the design of the study.  The subjects were given three beers and their reaction time was measured before and after drinking the alcohol.  This means that the same subjects were used to represent both conditions,  making them their own controls.
 Therefore,  the correct statement is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of these statements correctly explains bias?  Choices: a) It describes a process that creates estimates that are too high on average or too low on average.  b) It describes a process that results in a sample that does not represent the population.  c) It describes a lack of randomization in the sampling process.  d) It describes a sample that is not representative of the population.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what bias is.  Bias refers to a systematic error in a measurement or estimation process that causes the results to differ from the true value.
 Next,  I need to consider each statement and see which one correctly describes bias.
 a) This statement describes a process that creates estimates that are too high on average or too low on average.  This is a form of bias,  as it refers to a systematic error in the estimates.
 b) This statement describes a process that results in a sample that does not represent the population.  This is also a form of bias,  as it refers to a systematic error in the sampling process.
 c) This statement describes a lack of randomization in the sampling process.  This is a specific type of bias called selection bias,  but not all biases are related to the sampling process or randomization.
 d) This statement describes a sample that is not representative of the population.  This is similar to statement b,  and also a form of bias.

All four statements describe different aspects of bias.  However,  the most general and encompassing statement is that bias refers to a systematic error in a measurement or estimation process that causes the results to differ from the true value.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A company that produces facial tissues continually monitors tissue strength.  If the mean strength from sample data drops below a specified level,  the production process is halted and the machinery inspected.  Which of the following would result from a Type I error?  Choices: a) Halting the production process when sufficient customer complaints are received.  b) Halting the production process when the tissue strength is below specifications.  c) Halting the production process when the tissue strength is within specifications.  d) Allowing the production process to continue when the tissue strength is below specifications.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a Type I error is.  A Type I error occurs when we incorrectly reject the null hypothesis,  which in this case is that the tissue strength is within specifications.
 Now,  I need to find the choice that describes a situation where the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected.
 a) Halting the production process when sufficient customer complaints are received - This is not a Type I error because customer complaints are not the basis for the null hypothesis.
 b) Halting the production process when the tissue strength is below specifications - This is not a Type I error because the null hypothesis is correct in this case.
 c) Halting the production process when the tissue strength is within specifications - This is a Type I error because the null hypothesis (that the tissue strength is within specifications) is incorrectly rejected.
 d) Allowing the production process to continue when the tissue strength is below specifications - This is a Type II error because the null hypothesis is not rejected when it should be.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The longevity of people living in a certain locality has a standard deviation of 14  years.  What is the mean longevity if 30 % of the people live longer than 75  years?  Assume a normal distribution for life spans.  Choices: a) 75  - 0.30 (14 ) b) 75  + 0.30 (14 ) c) 75  - 0.4756 (14 ) d) 75  - 0.5244 (14 ) 
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the z-score corresponding to the 30 % of people living longer than 75  years.  Since the distribution is normal,  I can use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the z-score.  The z-score for 30 % is approximately -0.5244.
 Next,  I can use the z-score formula to find the mean longevity: z = (X - μ) / σ, where z is the z-score, X is the value (75  years), μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation (14  years).
 Rearranging the formula to solve for μ, I get μ = X - z * σ.
 Plugging in the values, I get μ = 75  - (-0.5244) * 14  = 75  + 0.5244 * 14 .
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Changing from a 90 % confidence interval estimate for a population proportion to a 99 % confidence interval estimate,  with all other things being equal,  Choices: a) increases the interval size by 9 %.  b) decreases the interval size by 9 %.  c) increases the interval size by 57 %.  d) decreases the interval size by 57 %.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the relationship between the confidence level and the interval size.  A higher confidence level means a wider interval because we want to be more certain about our estimate.
 Next,  I compare the given confidence levels: 90 % and 99 %.  Since 99 % is a higher confidence level than 90 %,  the interval for the 99 % confidence level will be wider.
 To calculate the increase in interval size,  I need to compare the critical values for the two confidence levels.  The critical value for a 90 % confidence level is approximately 1.645,  and for a 99 % confidence level,  it is approximately 2.576.
 The increase in the critical value is 2.576 - 1.645 = 0.931.
 To find the percentage increase,  I divide the increase by the original value and multiply by 100: (0.931 ÷ 1.645) * 100 = 56.56 %.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following is a binomial random variable?  Choices: a) The number of tosses before a ""5 "" appears when tossing a fair die.  b) The number of points a hockey team receives in 10  games,  where two points are awarded for wins,  one point for ties,  and no points for losses.  c) The number of hearts out of five cards randomly drawn from a deck of 52  cards,  without replacement.  d) The number of motorists not wearing seat belts in a random sample of five drivers.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the characteristics of a binomial random variable.  A binomial random variable has four main characteristics:
 1. The number of observations is fixed.
 2. Each observation is independent.
 3. Each observation has two possible outcomes, often referred to as ""success"" and ""failure.""
 4. The probability of success remains constant for each observation.

 Now,  I will evaluate each choice based on these characteristics:
 a) The number of tosses before a ""5 "" appears when tossing a fair die.  This is not a binomial random variable because the number of observations is not fixed.
 b) The number of points a hockey team receives in 10 games, where two points are awarded for wins, one point for ties, and no points for losses.  This is a binomial random variable because the number of observations (10 games) is fixed, each game is independent, there are two possible outcomes (win or loss), and the probability of success (winning) remains constant.
 c) The number of hearts out of five cards randomly drawn from a deck of 52 cards, without replacement.  This is not a binomial random variable because the observations are not independent (drawing a heart changes the probability of drawing another heart).
 d) The number of motorists not wearing seat belts in a random sample of five drivers.  This is not a binomial random variable because the observations are not independent (the probability of a motorist not wearing a seat belt may change from one driver to the next).

 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: If all the other variables remain constant,  which of the following will increase the power of a hypothesis test?  I. Increasing the sample size.  II. Increasing the significance level.  III. Increasing the probability of a Type II error.  Choices: a) I only b) II only c) III only d) I and II 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what factors affect the power of a hypothesis test.  The power of a hypothesis test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.  There are several factors that can affect the power of a hypothesis test,  including the sample size,  the significance level,  and the effect size.

Next,  I will consider each of the given options and determine their effect on the power of a hypothesis test.

I. Increasing the sample size: A larger sample size generally increases the power of a hypothesis test because it provides more information about the population,  which makes it easier to detect a true effect.

II. Increasing the significance level: The significance level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.  Increasing the significance level means that we are more likely to reject the null hypothesis,  even if it is true. This does not necessarily increase the power of the test; in fact,  it can decrease the power if the null hypothesis is true.

III. Increasing the probability of a Type II error: A Type II error occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.  Increasing the probability of a Type II error means that we are less likely to detect a true effect. This decreases the power of the hypothesis test.

Based on this analysis,  the only factor that increases the power of a hypothesis test among the given options is increasing the sample size (Option I).

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following statements is (are) true?  I.  In order to use a χ2  procedure,  the expected value for each cell of a one- or two-way table must be at least 5.  II.  In order to use χ2  procedures,  you must have at least 2  degrees of freedom.  III.  In a 4  × 2  two-way table,  the number of degrees of freedom is 3.  Choices: a) I only b) I and III only c) I and II only d) III only 
 Output:
 First,  I will analyze each statement individually.
 I.  In order to use a χ2  procedure,  the expected value for each cell of a one- or two-way table must be at least 5.  This statement is true.  The χ2  procedure requires that the expected value for each cell be at least 5 to ensure that the distribution is approximately normal.
 II.  In order to use χ2  procedures,  you must have at least 2  degrees of freedom.  This statement is also true.  The χ2  procedure requires at least 2  degrees of freedom to be applicable.
 III.  In a 4  × 2  two-way table,  the number of degrees of freedom is 3.  This statement is true as well.  The degrees of freedom for a two-way table can be calculated as (number of rows - 1) * (number of columns - 1), which in this case is (4 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 3.
 Therefore,  all three statements are true,  so the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Suppose two events,  E and F,  have nonzero probabilities p and q,  respectively.  Which of the following is impossible?  Choices: a) p + q > 1  b) p - q < 0  c) p /q > 1  d) E and F are both independent and mutually exclusive.  
 Output:
 First,  let's consider the properties of probabilities.  The probability of an event occurring is always between 0 and 1,  inclusive.  So,  p and q are both between 0 and 1.
 Next,  let's consider the options one by one.  a) p + q > 1 is possible,  as the sum of two probabilities can be greater than 1 if the events are not mutually exclusive.  For example,  if p = 0.5 and q = 0.5,  then p + q = 1.
 b) p - q < 0 is possible,  as the difference between two probabilities can be negative.  For example,  if p = 0.6 and q = 0.5,  then p - q = 0.1.
 c) p / q > 1 is possible,  as the ratio of two probabilities can be greater than 1.  For example,  if p = 0.6 and q = 0.3,  then p / q = 2.
 d) E and F are both independent and mutually exclusive is impossible.  Events cannot be both independent (the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other) and mutually exclusive (the occurrence of one event prevents the occurrence of the other).

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The probability that there will be an accident on Highway 48  each day depends on the weather.  If the weather is dry that day,  there is a 0.2 % chance of an accident on Highway 48 ; if the weather is wet that day,  there is a 1.0 % chance of an accident.  Today,  the weather station announced that there is a 20 % chance of the weather being wet.  What is the probability that there will be an accident on Highway 48  today?  Choices: a) 0.0004  b) 0.0016  c) 0.002  d) 0.0036  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the probability of an accident given that the weather is dry.  The probability of an accident on Highway 48  given that the weather is dry is 0.2 %,  or 0.002 in decimal form.
 Next,  I need to calculate the probability of an accident given that the weather is wet.  The probability of an accident on Highway 48  given that the weather is wet is 1.0 %,  or 0.01 in decimal form.
 Now,  I need to calculate the overall probability of an accident today.  There is a 20 % chance of the weather being wet,  so the probability of an accident given that the weather is wet is 0.2 * 0.01 = 0.002.
 The probability of an accident given that the weather is dry is 0.8 (1 - 0.2) * 0.002 = 0.0016.
 To find the overall probability of an accident today,  I add the probabilities of an accident given each weather condition: 0.002 + 0.0016 = 0.0036.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The binomial distribution is an appropriate model for which of the following?  Choices: a) The number of minutes in an hour for which the Dow-Jones average is above its beginning average for the day.  b) The number of cities among the 10  largest in New York State for which the weather is cloudy for most of a given day.  c) The number of drivers wearing seat belts if 10  consecutive drivers are stopped at a police roadblock.  d) None of the above.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what the binomial distribution is.  The binomial distribution is used to model the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials,  where each trial has only two possible outcomes (success or failure) and the probability of success is constant across all trials.
 Now,  I will go through each choice and see if it fits the criteria for the binomial distribution.
 a) The number of minutes in an hour for which the Dow-Jones average is above its beginning average for the day.  This choice does not fit the criteria because the trials are not independent; the Dow-Jones average being above its beginning average for one minute may affect the probability of it being above for the next minute.
 b) The number of cities among the 10  largest in New York State for which the weather is cloudy for most of a given day.  This choice does not fit the criteria because the trials are not independent; the weather in one city may affect the weather in another city.
 c) The number of drivers wearing seat belts if 10  consecutive drivers are stopped at a police roadblock.  This choice fits the criteria because the drivers are independent of each other,  each driver has only two possible outcomes (wearing or not wearing a seat belt), and the probability of a driver wearing a seat belt is constant across all drivers.
 d) None of the above.  This choice is not correct because choice c) fits the criteria for the binomial distribution.

"Input: Data were collected on two variables X and Y and a least squares regression line was fitted to the data.  The estimated equation for this data is y = –2.29  + 1.70 x.  One point has x = 5,  y = 6.  What is the residual for this point?  Choices: a) 7.91  b) 6.21  c) 0.21  d) –0.21  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the predicted value of y for the given x = 5.  Using the estimated equation y = –2.29  + 1.70 x,  I substitute x = 5: y = –2.29  + 1.70 * 5 = –2.29  + 8.5 = 6.21.
 Next,  I need to calculate the residual,  which is the difference between the observed value of y and the predicted value of y: residual = observed y – predicted y = 6 – 6.21 = –0.21.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of these explains why t should be used instead of z for inference procedures for means.  Choices: a) The Central Limit Theorem applies to proportions but not means.  b) We use z for proportions because proportions are approximately normal.  Means are not.  c) We use z for proportions because the sampling distribution of sample proportions is approximately normal,  but that is not the case for the sampling distribution of sample means.  d) When using the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation,  more variability is introduced into the sampling distribution of the statistic.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the difference between z-scores and t-scores.  Z-scores are used for inference procedures when the population standard deviation is known,  and the data follows a normal distribution.  T-scores are used when the population standard deviation is unknown and is estimated using the sample standard deviation,  and the data follows a t-distribution.
 Next,  I need to consider the context of means.  The sampling distribution of sample means is not guaranteed to be normally distributed,  especially when the sample size is small.  However,  when the sample size is large,  the Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample means will be approximately normal,  regardless of the shape of the population distribution.
 Now,  I can evaluate the choices.  Choice a is incorrect because the Central Limit Theorem applies to means, not just proportions.  Choice b is incorrect because means are not guaranteed to be normally distributed,  even if proportions are.  Choice c is incorrect because the sampling distribution of sample means is approximately normal when the sample size is large,  due to the Central Limit Theorem.  Choice d is correct because when using the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation,  more variability is introduced,  which is why a t-score is used instead of a z-score for inference procedures for means.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following is least likely to reduce bias in a sample survey?  Choices: a) Following up with those who did not respond to the survey the first time b) Asking questions in a neutral manner to avoid influencing the responses c) Using stratified random sampling rather than simple random sampling d) Selecting samples randomly 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider which option is least likely to reduce bias in a sample survey.  Following up with those who did not respond to the survey the first time can help increase response rates and reduce non-response bias, so it is not least likely to reduce bias.
 Next,  asking questions in a neutral manner to avoid influencing the responses can help reduce response bias, so it is not least likely to reduce bias.
 Using stratified random sampling rather than simple random sampling can help ensure that the sample represents the population more accurately and reduce sampling bias, so it is not least likely to reduce bias.
 Finally,  selecting samples randomly is the most effective way to reduce sampling bias, so it is not least likely to reduce bias.
 Therefore,  none of the given options are least likely to reduce bias in a sample survey.  However,  the question asks for the least likely option,  so the answer is {'sol': 'None of the given options'}"
"Input: For their first exam,  students in an AP Statistics class studied an average of 4  hours with a standard deviation of 1  hour.  Almost everyone did poorly on the exam,  and so for the second exam every student studied 10  hours.  What is the correlation between the numbers of hours students studied for each exam?  Choices: a) -1  b) 0  c) 0.4  d) 1  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what correlation measures.  Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.  In this case,  the two variables are the hours studied for each exam.

Next,  I need to consider the data given.  For the first exam,  students studied an average of 4  hours with a standard deviation of 1  hour.  For the second exam,  every student studied 10  hours.  There is no variation in the hours studied for the second exam,  as all students studied exactly 10  hours.

Since there is no variation in the second exam's hours studied,  the standard deviation is 0.  Correlation is calculated using the formula: r = Σ((x - x̄)(y - ȳ)) / (n * σ_x * σ_y), where x and y are the variables, x̄ and ȳ are their means, σ_x and σ_y are their standard deviations, and n is the number of observations.

In this case,  since σ_y = 0, the numerator of the correlation formula becomes 0, resulting in a correlation of 0.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: The appraised values of houses in a city have a mean of $125,000  with a standard deviation of $23,000.  Because of a new teachers' contract,  the school district needs an extra 10 % in funds compared to the previous year.  To raise this additional money,  the city instructs the assessment office to raise all appraised house values by $5,000.  What will be the new standard deviation of the appraised values of houses in the city?  Choices: a) $23,000  b) $25,300  c) $28,000  d) $30,300  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand that the standard deviation measures the dispersion of the data points around the mean.  Since the city instructs the assessment office to raise all appraised house values by $5,000,  this means that each data point will be shifted by $5,000.
 Next,  I need to consider how this shift affects the standard deviation.  The standard deviation is not affected by a shift in the data; it only considers the dispersion of the data points around the mean.  Therefore,  the new standard deviation will remain the same as the original standard deviation.
 The new standard deviation of the appraised values of houses in the city is $23,000.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A large company has offices in two locations,  one in New Jersey and one in Utah.  The mean salary of office assistants in the New Jersey office is $28,500.  The mean salary of office assistants in the Utah office is $22,500.  The New Jersey office has 128  office assistants and the Utah office has 32  office assistants.  What is the mean salary paid to the office assistants in this company?  Choices: a) $22,500  b) $23,700  c) $25,500  d) $27,300  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the total salary paid to office assistants in both offices.  For the New Jersey office,  the total salary is 28,500  * 128  = 3,648,000  dollars.
 Next,  for the Utah office,  the total salary is 22,500  * 32  = 720,000  dollars.
 The total salary paid to all office assistants is 3,648,000  + 720,000  = 4,368,000  dollars.
 Now,  I need to calculate the total number of office assistants in the company.  The total number is 128  + 32  = 160  office assistants.
 To find the mean salary,  I divide the total salary by the total number of office assistants: 4,368,000  dollars ÷ 160  office assistants = 27,300  dollars.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following is a false statement about simple random samples?  Choices: a) A sample must be reasonably large to be properly considered a simple random sample.  b) Inspection of a sample will give no indication of whether or not it is a simple random sample.  c) Attributes of a simple random sample may be very different from attributes of the population.  d) Every element of the population has an equal chance of being picked.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a simple random sample is.  A simple random sample is a subset of individuals from a larger group where each individual has an equal chance of being selected.
 Now,  I will go through each choice and evaluate its truthfulness.
 a) A sample must be reasonably large to be properly considered a simple random sample.  This statement is false.  A simple random sample can be of any size,  as long as each individual has an equal chance of being selected.
 b) Inspection of a sample will give no indication of whether or not it is a simple random sample.  This statement is true.  A simple random sample is designed to be completely random,  so there should be no pattern or indication that can be discerned by inspection.
 c) Attributes of a simple random sample may be very different from attributes of the population.  This statement is true.  While a simple random sample is supposed to be representative of the population,  there is still a chance that it may not be,  especially if the sample size is small.
 d) Every element of the population has an equal chance of being picked.  This statement is true.  This is the definition of a simple random sample.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A telephone executive instructs an associate to contact 104  customers using their service to obtain their opinions in regard to an idea for a new pricing package.  The associate notes the number of customers whose names begin with A and uses a random number table to pick four of these names.  She then proceeds to use the same procedure for each letter of the alphabet and combines the 4  × 26  = 104  results into a group to be contacted.  Which of the following is a correct conclusion?  Choices: a) Her procedure makes use of chance.  b) Her procedure results in a simple random sample.  c) Each customer has an equal probability of being included in the survey.  d) Her procedure introduces bias through sampling error.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze the procedure described.  The associate starts by contacting 104  customers whose names begin with A,  and then uses a random number table to pick four of these names.  She repeats this process for each letter of the alphabet.
 The key point here is that the associate is using a random number table to pick four names for each letter of the alphabet.  This means that the selection of customers is based on chance,  not a systematic or non-random method.
 Now,  I need to consider the choices given.  Choice a) states that her procedure makes use of chance,  which is true based on the analysis above.
 Choice b) states that her procedure results in a simple random sample.  A simple random sample is a method where every possible sample of a given size has an equal chance of being selected.  In this case,  the associate is selecting four names for each letter of the alphabet,  and then combining them into a group of 104  names.  This does not guarantee that every possible sample of 104  names has an equal chance of being selected,  so this choice is not correct.
 Choice c) states that each customer has an equal probability of being included in the survey.  This is not true,  because the associate is selecting four names for each letter of the alphabet,  which means that names beginning with letters earlier in the alphabet will have a higher chance of being selected than names beginning with letters later in the alphabet.
 Choice d) states that her procedure introduces bias through sampling error.  This is a correct conclusion,  because the procedure does not result in a simple random sample and each customer does not have an equal probability of being included in the survey.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A company has a choice of three investment schemes.  Option I gives a sure $25,000  return on investment.  Option II gives a 50 % chance of returning $50,000  and a 50 % chance of returning $10,000.  Option III gives a 5 % chance of returning $100,000  and a 95 % chance of returning nothing.  Which option should the company choose?  Choices: a) Option II if it wants to maximize expected return b) Option I if it needs at least $20,000  to pay off an overdue loan c) Option III if it needs at least $80,000  to pay off an overdue loan d) All of the above answers are correct.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the expected return for each option.
 For Option I,  the return is guaranteed to be $25,000,  so the expected return is $25,000.
 For Option II,  the expected return is 0.5 * $50,000  + 0.5 * $10,000  = $25,000  + $5,000  = $30,000.
 For Option III,  the expected return is 0.05 * $100,000  + 0.95 * $0  = $5,000.
 Now,  I need to consider the conditions given in the choices.
 a) If the company wants to maximize expected return,  it should choose Option II,  since it has the highest expected return of $30,000.
 b) If the company needs at least $20,000  to pay off an overdue loan and Option I gives a sure $25,000  return,  it should choose Option I.
 c) If the company needs at least $80,000  to pay off an overdue loan,  it should choose Option III,  since it has a chance of returning $100,000.

"Input: A one-sided test of a hypothesis about a population mean,  based on a sample of size 14,  yields a P-value of 0.075.  Which of the following best describes the range of tvalues that would have given this P-value?  Choices: a) 1.345  < t< 1.761  b) 1.356  < t< 1.782  c) 1.771  < t< 2.160  d) 1.350  < t< 1.771  
 Output:
 First,  we need to consider the context of the question.  It is asking about a one-sided test of a hypothesis about a population mean,  based on a sample size of 14.  This implies we are dealing with a t-distribution,  since the population standard deviation is not known.

Next,  we need to consider the P-value.  The P-value is 0.075,  which means that there is a 7.5% chance of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed,  assuming the null hypothesis is true.

Now,  we need to find the range of t-values that would correspond to this P-value.  Since it is a one-sided test,  we are looking for the upper tail of the t-distribution.

To find the t-value,  we can use the inverse cumulative distribution function.  For a one-sided test with a 0.075 P-value,  we would look at the 0.925 quantile of the t-distribution with 13 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1).

Using a t-table or a calculator,  we find that the t-value corresponding to a 0.925 quantile and 13 degrees of freedom is approximately 1.782.

Therefore,  the range of t-values that would have given this P-Output: {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: The president of an online music streaming service whose customers pay a fee wants to gather additional information about customers who have joined in the past 12  months.  The company plans to send out an e-mail survey to a sample of current customers with a link that gives participants a month of streaming service for free once the survey has been completed.  They know that musical tastes vary by geographical region.  Which of the following sample plans would produce the most representative sample of its customers?  Choices: a) Choose all of the customers who joined in the last month.  b) Make a list of all the customers who joined in the last 12  months and choose a random sample of customers on this list.  c) From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12  months,  classify customers by the state in which they live,  then choose 10  customers from each state.  d) From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12  months,  classify customers by the state in which they live,  then choose 3 % of the customers from each state.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider what makes a sample representative.  A representative sample should reflect the characteristics of the population it is drawn from,  including factors like geographical region.
 Next,  I will evaluate each option.
 a) Choosing all customers who joined in the last month may not be representative because it does not account for the geographical distribution of customers.
 b) Making a list of all customers who joined in the last 12  months and choosing a random sample from this list does not account for geographical differences.
 c) Classifying customers by state and then choosing 10  customers from each state ensures that each state is represented,  which is a good start towards a representative sample.
 d) Classifying customers by state and then choosing 3 % of the customers from each state also ensures that each state is represented,  and it does so in a way that is proportional to the size of the state's customer base.

"Input: You need to construct a 94 % confidence interval for a population proportion.  What is the upper critical value of z to be used in constructing this interval?  Choices: a) 0.9699  b) 1.96  c) 1.555  d) 1.88  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the level of significance for a 94 % confidence interval.  The level of significance is 1  - 0.94  = 0.06.
 Next,  since the confidence interval is two-tailed,  I need to divide the level of significance by 2: 0.06  ÷ 2  = 0.03.
 Now,  I need to find the critical value of z for a 0.03 level of significance in the standard normal distribution table.  The critical value is 1.88.

"Input: A local school has seven math teachers and seven English teachers.  When comparing their mean salaries,  which of the following is most appropriate?  Choices: a) A two-sample z-test of population means b) A two-sample t-test of population means c) A one-sample z-test on a set of differences d) None of the above are appropriate.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the nature of the data and the question being asked.  The question is comparing the mean salaries of two distinct groups: math teachers and English teachers.
 Next,  I need to consider the sample sizes.  There are seven math teachers and seven English teachers, which is a small sample size.
 Finally,  I need to consider the assumptions required for each test.  A two-sample z-test of population means requires the data to be normally distributed and the variances to be equal.  A two-sample t-test of population means is used when the sample size is small and does not require the data to be normally distributed.  A one-sample z-test on a set of differences assumes that the differences are normally distributed.
 Given the small sample size and the need for normality and equal variances for the z-tests, the most appropriate test is the two-sample t-test of population means.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A small kiosk at the Atlanta airport carries souvenirs in the price range of $3.99  to $29.99,  with a mean price of $14.75.  The airport authorities decide to increase the rent charged for a kiosk by 5  percent.  To make up for the increased rent,  the kiosk owner decides to increase the prices of all items by 50  cents.  As a result,  which of the following will happen?  Choices: a) The mean price and the range of prices will increase by 50  cents.  b) The mean price will remain the same,  but the range of prices will increase by 50  cents.  c) The mean price and the standard deviation of prices will increase by 50  cents.  d) The mean price will increase by 50  cents,  but the standard deviation of prices will remain the same.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the effect of the rent increase on the prices.  The kiosk owner decides to increase the prices of all items by 50  cents.  This means that the mean price will also increase by 50  cents.
 Next,  I need to consider the effect of the rent increase on the range of prices.  The range of prices is the difference between the highest and lowest prices.  Since the lowest price is $3.99 and the highest price is $29.99,  the range is $29.99 - $3.99 = $26.
 The 50  cent increase in price will not change the range of prices because the lowest and highest prices are both increased by the same amount.
 Now,  I need to consider the effect of the rent increase on the standard deviation of prices.  The standard deviation measures the amount of variation in the prices.  Since the prices are all increased by the same amount, the variation in the prices remains the same, so the standard deviation will not change.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the given information.  We have 100  checks with an average donation of $155  and a standard deviation of $32.
 The question asks for the most appropriate statement.  Let's analyze each option:
 a) This November,  the average donation is $155.  This statement is true,  as it matches the given average donation.
 b) 50 % of all donations this November are more than $155.  This statement is not necessarily true,  as the standard deviation does not directly indicate the percentage of donations above or below the average.
 c) We are 95 % confident that the average donation in November is between about $91  and $219.  This statement is not directly supported by the given information,  as it involves a confidence interval calculation that requires additional assumptions.
 d) We are 95 % confident that the average donation in November is between about $149  and $161.  This statement is also not directly supported by the given information,  for the same reason as option c.

The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of x-is the same as the standard deviation of x- divided by the square root of the sample size.  III.  If the sample size is large,  the shape of the sampling distribution of x- is approximately normal.  Choices: a) I only b) I & II only c) II only d) III only 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the central limit theorem.  The central limit theorem states that,  given a sufficiently large sample size,  the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed if the population is either normal or the sample size is large,  regardless of the shape of the population distribution.
 Now,  I will analyze the given statements:
 I.  The mean of the sampling distribution of x-is the same as the mean of the population.  This statement is true because the mean of the sampling distribution of the sample mean is equal to the population mean.
 II.  The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of x-is the same as the standard deviation of x- divided by the square root of the sample size.  This statement is true because the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the-sample mean is equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.
 III.  If the sample size is large,  the shape of the sampling distribution of x- is approximately normal.  This statement is true because,  according to the central limit theorem,  if the sample size is large,  the shape of the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal.
 Therefore,  all three statements are true,  which means the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A large city was interested in annexing part of the surrounding county.  In a survey conducted by the local newspaper,  58  percent of respondents said they were against the annexation.  During the actual vote,  not all eligible voters voted,  but 56  percent of the respondents voted against the annexation.  Which of the following best describes the difference in the percentages obtained from the newspaper poll and the vote itself?  Choices: a) It is an example of nonresponse bias,  the systematic tendency of individuals with particular characteristics to refuse to answer a survey question.  b) It is the systematic difference between a statistic and parameter caused by the nonrandom selection of surveyed persons.  c) It is the difference between the same statistics computed from two different samples.  d) It is the difference between the statistic and the truth due to use of a random sample.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the difference between the newspaper poll and the actual vote.  The newspaper poll had 58  percent of respondents saying they were against the annexation,  while the actual vote had 56  percent of the respondents voting against the annexation.
 The difference in percentages is due to the fact that not all eligible voters participated in the actual vote.  This means that the sample used in the actual vote was not representative of the entire population of eligible voters.
 The best description of this difference is that it is an example of nonresponse bias,  as it is the systematic tendency of individuals with particular characteristics (in this case, not voting) to influence the results of the survey.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: After receiving several complaints from his customers about the store being closed on Sundays,  a storekeeper decided to conduct a survey.  He randomly selected 100  female customers and 120  male customers,  and asked them,  ""Are you interested in shopping at this store on Sundays? "" He counted the number of customers answering ""yes"" and constructed a 95  percent confidence interval for the difference by subtracting the proportions of female from the proportion of male customers in favor of shopping on Sundays.  The resulting interval was (–0.23,  –0.18 ).  Which of the following is a correct interpretation of the interval?  Choices: a) We are 95  percent confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.  b) We are 95  percent confident that the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays.  c) We are 95  percent confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays is equal to the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.  d) Because the interval contains negative values,  it is invalid and should not be interpreted.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the confidence interval.  The interval is (–0.23,  –0.18 ),  which means that the difference in proportions between male and female customers is between –0.23 and –0.18.
 Since the interval is negative,  it means that the proportion of male customers interested in shopping on Sundays is higher than the proportion of female customers.
 Therefore,  the correct interpretation is that we are 95  percent confident that the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays.

"Input: Which of the following is the primary difference between an experiment and an observational study?  Choices: a) Experiments are only conducted on human subjects; observational studies can be conducted on nonhuman subjects.  b) In an experiment,  the researcher manipulates some variable to observe its effect on a response variable; in an observational study,  he or she simply observes and records the observations.  c) Experiments must use randomized treatment and control groups; observational studies also use treatment and control groups,  but they do not need to be randomized.  d) Experiments must be double-blind; observational studies do not need to be.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the difference between an experiment and an observational study.  An experiment is a scientific method in which the researcher manipulates one or more variables to observe their effects on other variables.  An observational study,  on the other hand,  is a method in which the researcher simply observes and records the variables of interest without manipulating them.
 Now,  I will evaluate the choices given.  Choice a) suggests that experiments are only conducted on human subjects,  which is not true,  as experiments can be conducted on nonhuman subjects as well.  Choice b) describes the primary difference between an experiment and an observational study,  as it explains that in an experiment,  the researcher manipulates some variable to observe its effect on a response variable,  while in an observational study,  the researcher simply observes and records the observations.  Choice c) states that experiments must use randomized treatment and control groups,  which is not always true,  as some experiments may not use randomized groups.  Choice d) suggests that experiments must be double-blind,  which is not always the case,  as some experiments may not be double-blind.

"Input: Random variable X is normally distributed,  with a mean of 25  and a standard deviation of 4.  Which of the following is the approximate interquartile range for this distribution?  Choices: a) 25.00  – 22.30  = 2.70  b) 27.70  – 22.30  = 5.40  c) 27.70  ÷ 22.30  = 1.24  d) 2.00 (4.00 ) = 8.00  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) for the given normal distribution.  For a normal distribution,  Q1 is approximately at the 25th percentile and Q3 is approximately at the 75th percentile.
 Next,  I need to convert these percentiles to the corresponding z-scores using the formula z = (x - μ) / σ, where x is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.  For Q1,  the z-score is approximately -0.67 (since 25th percentile is -0.67 standard deviations below the mean for a normal distribution), and for Q3,  the z-score is approximately 0.67 (since 75th percentile is 0.67 standard deviations above the mean for a normal distribution).
 Now,  I need to convert these z-scores back to the corresponding x-values using the formula x = μ + z * σ.  For Q1,  the x-value is 25 + (-0.67) * 4 = 22.32, and for Q3,  the x-value is 25 + (0.67) * 4 = 27.68.
 The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between Q3 and Q1,  so IQR = 27.68 - 22.32 = 5.36.

Choices: a) P(A ∪ B) implies events A and B are independent.  b) P(A ∪ B) = 1  implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.  c) P(A ∩ B) = 0  implies events A and B are independent.  d) P(A ∩ B) = 0  implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.  
 Output:
 First,  let's recall the definitions of independence and mutual exclusivity.  Two events A and B are independent if P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B).  They are mutually exclusive if P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B).
 Now,  let's analyze each statement.
 a) P(A ∪ B) implies events A and B are independent.  This statement is not necessarily true.  Independence is determined by the intersection of the events, not their union.
 b) P(A ∪ B) = 1 implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.  This statement is not necessarily true.  Mutual exclusivity is determined by the union of the events, not their probability being 1.
 c) P(A ∩ B) = 0  implies events A and B are independent.  This statement is not true.  Independence is determined by the product of the probabilities of the individual events, not the probability of their intersection being 0.
 d) P(A ∩ B) = 0  implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.  This statement is true.  If the probability of the intersection of A and B is 0, it means that A and B cannot occur together, which is the definition of mutual exclusivity.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A company has 400  employees.  Their mean income is $20,500,  and the standard deviation of their incomes is $3,750.  The distribution of incomes is normally distributed.  How many of the 400  employees do you expect to have an income of between $13,000  and $28,000?  Choices: a) 50  b) 100  c) 200  d) 390  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the range of incomes between $13,000  and $28,000.  The difference between these two values is $28,000 - $13,000 = $15,000.
 Next,  I need to calculate the number of standard deviations this range represents.  The number of standard deviations is $15,000 ÷ $3,750 = 4.
 Now,  I can use the empirical rule,  which states that approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean,  95% falls within two standard deviations,  and 99.7% falls within three standard deviations.
 Since the range of incomes between $13,000  and $28,000 includes two standard deviations (4 standard deviations in total),  I can estimate that approximately 95% of the employees have incomes within this range.
 To find the number of employees within this range,  I multiply the percentage by the total number of employees: 0.95 * 400 = 380.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: As reported on CNN,  in a May 1999  national poll 43 % of high school students expressed fear about going to school.  Which of the following best describes what is meant by the poll having a margin of error of 5 %?  Choices: a) It is likely that the true proportion of high school students afraid to go to school is between 38 % and 48 %.  b) Five percent of the students refused to participate in the poll.  c) Between 38 % and 48 % of those surveyed expressed fear about going to school.  d) There is a 0.05  probability that the 43 % result is in error.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what margin of error means in the context of a poll.  The margin of error is a measure of the uncertainty in the poll results.  It indicates that the true population proportion may be within a certain range around the reported proportion.

Next,  I need to consider the reported proportion and the margin of error.  The reported proportion is 43 %,  and the margin of error is 5 %.

Now,  I need to determine the range of the true population proportion.  To do this,  I add and subtract the margin of error from the reported proportion: 43 % ± 5 % = 38 % to 48 %.

The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Suppose you wish to compare the AP Statistics exam results for the male and female students taking AP Statistics at your high school.  Which is the most appropriate technique for gathering the needed data?  Choices: a) Census b) Sample survey c) Experiment d) Observational study 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the purpose of the data collection.  The goal is to compare the AP Statistics exam results for male and female students.
 Next,  I need to consider the type of data being collected.  The data is qualitative (exam results) and quantitative (gender).
 Now,  I need to consider the methods available for data collection.  A census would involve collecting data from all students,  which may not be feasible or practical.  A sample survey would involve selecting a subset of students to survey,  which could provide useful information.  An experiment would involve manipulating variables to test a hypothesis,  which is not applicable here.  An observational study would involve observing variables without manipulating them,  which could also provide useful information.
 To determine the most appropriate technique,  I need to consider the purpose,  the type of data,  and the methods available.  In this case,  a sample survey or an observational study could both be appropriate,  depending on the specific goals and resources.  However,  a sample survey is generally more controlled and can provide more accurate results,  so it is the most appropriate technique.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: In one study half of a class were instructed to watch exactly 1  hour of television per day,  the other half were told to watch 5  hours per day,  and then their class grades were compared.  In a second study students in a class responded to a questionnaire asking about their television usage and their class grades.  Choices: a) The first study was an experiment without a control group,  while the second was an observational study.  b) The first study was an observational study,  while the second was a controlled experiment.  c) Both studies were controlled experiments.  d) Both studies were observational studies.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the type of study in the first part.  In the first study,  the researchers instructed half of the class to watch 1  hour of television and the other half to watch 5  hours.  This indicates that the researchers manipulated the variable of television usage,  which is characteristic of an experiment.
 Next,  I need to determine if there was a control group in the first study.  However,  there is no group in the first study that did not watch television,  so there is no control group.
 Now,  I need to identify the type of study in the second part.  In the second study,  students filled out a questionnaire about their television usage and class grades.  This indicates that the researchers observed the variables of television usage and class grades,  which is characteristic of an observational study.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: In a high school of 1650  students,  132  have personal investments in the stock market.  To estimate the total stock investment by students in this school,  two plans are proposed.  Plan I would sample 30  students at random,  find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment,  and then multiply both ends of this interval by 1650  to get an interval estimate of the total investment.  Plan II would sample 30  students at random from among the 132  who have investments in the market,  find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment,  and then multiply both ends of this interval by 132  to get an interval estimate of the total investment.  Which is the better plan for estimating the total stock market investment by students in this school?  Choices: a) Plan I b) Plan II c) Both plans use random samples and so will produce equivalent results.  d) Neither plan will give an accurate estimate.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the representativeness of the sample in each plan.  In Plan I,  the sample of 30  students is taken from the entire school,  which includes students who may not have investments in the stock market.  This could potentially lead to a less representative sample for estimating the total stock market investment.
 In Plan II,  the sample of 30  students is taken only from the 132  students who have investments in the stock market.  This makes the sample more directly relevant to the estimation of the total stock market investment.
 Next,  I need to consider the size of the population being sampled.  In Plan I,  the sample size of 30  students is a relatively small proportion of the total 1650  students,  which could lead to a wider confidence interval and potentially less accurate estimation of the average investment.
 In Plan II,  the sample size of 30  students is a larger proportion of the total 132  students with investments,  which could lead to a narrower confidence interval and potentially more accurate estimation of the average investment.
 Finally,  I need to consider the effect of multiplying the confidence interval by the total number of students or the number of students with investments.  Both plans involve this step,  but the key difference is in the representativeness of the sample.
 Therefore,  considering the representativeness of the sample and the size of the population being sampled,  Plan II is the better plan for estimating the total stock market investment by students in this school.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Sampling error occurs Choices: a) when interviewers make mistakes resulting in bias.  b) because a sample statistic is used to estimate a population parameter.  c) when interviewers use judgment instead of random choice in picking the sample.  d) when samples are too small.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what sampling error is.  Sampling error is the difference between a sample statistic and its corresponding population parameter due to the fact that a random sample is not a perfect representation of the population.
 Now,  I need to consider each choice and see which one describes sampling error.
 a) When interviewers make mistakes resulting in bias,  it is not necessarily a sampling error.  Bias can occur in various ways,  not just due to sampling.
 b) This choice directly describes sampling error.  A sample statistic is used to estimate a population parameter,  and the difference between them is the sampling error.
 c) When interviewers use judgment instead of random choice in picking the sample,  it is a type of non-random sampling that can introduce bias,  but it is not specifically a sampling error.
 d) When samples are too small,  it can increase the margin of error,  but it does not directly describe sampling error.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: The regression analysis of question 20  indicated that ""R-sq = 98.1 %. "" Which of the following is (are) true?  I.  There is a strong positive linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables.  II.  There is a strong negative linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables.  III.  About 98 % of the variation in the response variable can be explained by the regression on the explanatory variable.  Choices: a) I and III only b) I or II only c) I or II (but not both) and III d) II and III only 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the meaning of R-sq = 98.1 %.  R-sq represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (response variable) that is predictable from the independent variable (explanatory variable).  A high R-sq value, such as 98.1 %, indicates a strong relationship between the explanatory and response variables.

Next,  I need to consider the possible relationships between the explanatory and response variables.  A strong positive linear relationship means that as the explanatory variable increases, the response variable also increases.  A strong negative linear relationship means that as the explanatory variable increases, the response variable decreases.

Now,  I need to evaluate the given statements:
I.  There is a strong positive linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables.
II.  There is a strong negative linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables.
III.  About 98 % of the variation in the response variable can be explained by the regression on the explanatory variable.

Statement I and II are mutually exclusive, meaning that they cannot both be true at the same time.  Since R-sq is high, it indicates a strong relationship, but it does not specify the direction of the relationship (positive or negative).  Therefore, statement II cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information.

Statement III is true, as the high R-sq value (98.1 %) indicates that a large proportion of the variation in the response variable can be explained by the regression on the explanatory variable.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: In a clinic,  50  patients with sleep disorders are randomly assigned to one of two different groups.  Patients in one group are given medication before bedtime.  Patients in the other group are given blindfolds and played soft music at bedtime.  Each patient is attached to a machine that records breathing patterns.  From the patterns,  it is possible to determine if the patient is awake or asleep.  The data will be used to decide which method is more effective in helping patients with sleep disorders.  Which of the following statements is correct in the context of this experiment?  Choices: a) It is not possible for this experiment to be single-blind or double-blind,  because human subjects are involved.  b) This is only a single-blind experiment because the experimenters did not include a control group that received neither medication nor a blindfold and soft music.  c) This is only a single-blind experiment because patients will know which treatment they are receiving,  although the examining doctor might not.  d) This is a double-blind experiment because the experimenters could prevent both groups of patients from knowing what sort of treatment the other group is receiving.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the definitions of single-blind and double-blind experiments.  In a single-blind experiment,  the participants are aware of the treatment they are receiving,  but the experimenters are not.  In a double-blind experiment,  neither the participants nor the experimenters know which treatment the participants are receiving.

Next,  I need to analyze the given experiment.  Patients in one group are given medication,  and patients in the other group are given blindfolds and soft music.  Patients are aware of the treatment they are receiving,  so they are not blinded.

Now,  I need to consider if the experimenters are blinded.  The experimenters are aware of the treatments given to each group,  so they are not blinded.

Therefore,  the experiment is a single-blind experiment because the patients are aware of the treatment they are receiving,  but the experimenters are not.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A study was conducted to test a new style of keyboard in preventing repetitive stress disorders.  Volunteers who have had problems with such injuries were randomly assigned to use either a traditional keyboard or the new design.  A significance test was conducted with the alternative hypothesis that a smaller proportion of those using the new keyboard will suffer injuries than those using the traditional keyboard.  The resulting P-value was 0.07.  Which is a correct interpretation of this P-value?  Choices: a) The null hypothesis should be rejected.  b) The null hypothesis should be accepted.  c) There is a 7 % chance that the null hypothesis is correct.  d) There is a 7 % chance of getting a difference between the two groups at least as large as the observed difference if the new keyboard is really no better at preventing injuries.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the study and the alternative hypothesis.  The alternative hypothesis states that a smaller proportion of those using the new keyboard will suffer injuries than those using the traditional keyboard.  This means we are testing if the new keyboard is better at preventing injuries.

Next,  I need to consider the significance level.  In this case,  the significance level is not explicitly mentioned,  but it is common to use a 0.05 significance level in hypothesis testing.

Now,  I need to look at the P-value.  The P-value is 0.07.

To determine if we should reject or accept the null hypothesis,  we compare the P-value to the significance level.  Since the P-value (0.07) is greater than the significance level (0.05),  we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

However,  the question asks for the correct interpretation of the P-value,  not the decision to reject or accept the null hypothesis.  The P-value represents the probability of observing the data,  or data more extreme,  assuming the null hypothesis is true.  In this case,  the P-value of 0.07 means there is a 7 % chance of getting a difference between the two groups at least as large as the observed difference if the new keyboard is really no better at preventing injuries.

Therefore,  the correct interpretation of the P-value is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A college admissions officer is interested in comparing the SAT math scores of high school applicants who have and have not taken AP Statistics.  She randomly pulls the files of five applicants who took AP Statistics and five applicants who did not,  and proceeds to run a t-test to compare the mean SAT math scores of the two groups.  Which of the following is a necessary assumption?  Choices: a) The population variances from each group are known.  b) The population variances from each group are unknown.  c) The population variances from the two groups are equal.  d) The population of SAT scores from each group is normally distributed.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the t-test.  The t-test is used to compare the means of two groups when the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown.
 Next,  I need to consider the necessary assumptions for a t-test.  The t-test assumes that the data is normally distributed,  and that the variances of the two groups are equal.

"Input: Given that P(E) = 0.32,  P(F) = 0.15,  and P(E ∩ F) = 0.048,  which of the following is a correct conclusion?  Choices: a) The events E and F are both independent and mutually exclusive.  b) The events E and F are neither independent nor mutually exclusive.  c) The events E and F are mutually exclusive but not independent.  d) The events E and F are independent but not mutually exclusive.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to check if the events E and F are independent.  Two events are independent if P(E ∩ F) = P(E) * P(F).  In this case,  P(E) * P(F) = 0.32 * 0.15 = 0.048,  which is equal to P(E ∩ F).  So,  the events E and F are independent.
 Next,  I need to check if the events E and F are mutually exclusive.  Two events are mutually exclusive if P(E ∩ F) = 0.  In this case,  P(E {""sol"": 'd'})"
"Input: A medical research team tests for tumor reduction in a sample of patients using three different dosages of an experimental cancer drug.  Which of the following is true?  Choices: a) There are three explanatory variables and one response variable.  b) There is one explanatory variable with three levels of response.  c) Tumor reduction is the only explanatory variable,  but there are three response variables corresponding to the different dosages.  d) There are three levels of a single explanatory variable.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the variables in the scenario.  The tumor reduction is the variable we are measuring,  so it is the response variable.  The dosages of the cancer drug are the variables that we are changing to see the effect on tumor reduction,  so they are the explanatory variables.
 Next,  I need to consider how many explanatory variables there are and how many levels each has.  In this case,  there is only one variable being changed (the dosage of the cancer drug),  and it has three different levels (the three different dosages).
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A department store at a large mall claims that over 60  percent of the mall’s visitors shop at that store.  Let p = the proportion of the mall’s visitors who shop at the store.  Which of the following pairs of hypotheses should be used to support this claim?  Choices: a) H0 : p ≤ 0.60  and Ha: p > 0.60  b) H0 : p = 0.60  and Ha: p 0.60  c) H0 : p = 0.60  and Ha: p < 0.60  d) H0 : p > 0.60  and Ha: p 0.60  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the claim.  The claim is that over 60  percent of the mall’s visitors shop at the store.  This means the null hypothesis should represent the claim that is being tested,  and the alternative hypothesis should represent the claim that is being made.
 The null hypothesis (H0) should be that the proportion of visitors who shop at the store is equal to 60  percent,  or p = 0.60.  The alternative hypothesis (Ha) should be that the proportion of visitors who shop at the store is greater than 60  percent,  or p > 0.60.
 Therefore,  the correct pair of hypotheses is H0 : p = 0.60  and Ha: p > 0.60.

"Input: Which of the following can affect the value of the correlation r?  Choices: a) A change in measurement units b) A change in which variable is called x and which is called y c) Adding the same constant to all values of the x-variable d) None of the above can affect the r value.  
 Output:
 First, let's consider each choice and see if it can affect the value of the correlation r.
 a) A change in measurement units: The correlation coefficient r is a unitless measure, so changing the measurement units will not affect the value of r.
 b) A change in which variable is called x and which is called y: Switching the labels of the variables does not change the relationship between them, so the value of r will remain the same.
 c) Adding the same constant to all values of the x-variable: This transformation will not change the relationship between the variables, so the value of r will remain the same.
 d) None of the above can affect the r value.

Based on the analysis of each choice, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: In general,  how does tripling the sample size change the confidence interval size?  Choices: a) It triples the interval size.  b) It divides the interval size by 3.  c) It multiples the interval size by 1.732.  d) It divides the interval size by 1.732.  
 Output:
 First,  let's consider the formula for the confidence interval: CI = x̄ ± Z * (σ/√n), where x̄ is the sample mean, Z is the Z-score, σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.
 When the sample size is tripled,  the new sample size is 3n.
 To find the new confidence interval,  we substitute 3n for n in the formula: CI' = x̄ ± Z * (σ/√(3n)).
 Now,  we can simplify the formula by factoring out the √3 from the denominator: CI' = x̄ ± Z * (σ/√3) * (1/√n).
 Comparing the new confidence interval CI' to the original confidence interval CI,  we can see that the size of the confidence interval is divided by √3,  which is approximately 1.732.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Suppose the correlation between two variables is r = 0.19.  What is the new correlation if 0.23  is added to all values of the x-variable,  every value of the y-variable is doubled,  and the two variables are interchanged?  Choices: a) 0.19  b) 0.42  c) 0.84  d) -0.19  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the effect of adding 0.23  to all values of the x-variable.  This will not change the correlation because adding a constant to all values of a variable does not affect the correlation.
 Next,  I need to consider the effect of doubling every value of the y-variable.  Multiplying all values of a variable by a constant will also not change the correlation because multiplying by a constant does not affect the correlation.
 Finally,  I need to consider the effect of interchanging the variables.  When the variables are interchanged,  the correlation remains the same because the correlation is a symmetric measure.
 Therefore,  the new correlation is the same as the original correlation,  which is 0.19.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Students in AP Statistics class were timed in seconds while solving a series of mathematical brainteasers.  One student's time had a standardized score of z = 2.40.  If the times are all changed to minutes,  what will then be the student's standardized score?  Choices: a) z = 0.04  b) z = 0.4  c) z = 1.80  d) z = 2.40  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a standardized score is.  A standardized score,  z,  is calculated as (X - μ) / σ,  where X is the individual score,  μ is the mean,  and σ is the standard deviation.
 Next,  I need to consider the change in units from seconds to minutes.  Since there are 60 seconds in a minute,  each time in seconds can be divided by 60 to get the time in minutes.
 Now,  I need to apply this change to the student's time.  If the student's time in seconds is X,  then the time in minutes is X / 60.
 To find the new standardized score,  I substitute X with (X / 60) in the formula: z = ((X / 60) - μ) / σ.
 Since the mean and standard deviation,  μ and σ,  do not change with the unit conversion,  the new standardized score is the same as the original,  z = 2.40.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: An experiment was designed to test the effects of three different types of paint on the durability of wooden toys.  Because boys and girls tend to play differently with toys,  a randomly selected group of children was divided into two groups by sex.  Which of the following statements about this experiment is true?  Choices: a) There are three types of paint and two sex groups,  giving a total of six treatment combinations in this experiment.  b) Type of paint is a blocking factor.  c) Sex is a blocking factor.  d) This is a completely randomized design.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the factors being tested in the experiment.  The experiment is testing the effects of three different types of paint on the durability of wooden toys,  so paint is a factor.  Additionally,  the experiment is considering the difference between boys and girls,  so sex is also a factor.
 Next,  I need to consider how the experiment is designed.  The children are divided into two groups by sex,  and each group is then tested with the different types of paint.  This means there are three treatment combinations for each sex group.
 Now,  I need to determine the type of experimental design.  Since the children are divided into two groups by sex and then each group is tested with the different types of paint,  this is not a completely randomized design.  Instead,  it is a randomized block design,  with sex as the blocking factor.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Suppose there is a correlation of r = 0.9  between number of hours per day students study and GPAs.  Which of the following is a reasonable conclusion?  Choices: a) 90 % of students who study receive high grades.  b) 90 % of students who receive high grades study a lot.  c) 90 % of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day.  d) 81 % of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what the correlation coefficient r means.  The correlation coefficient r measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.  In this case,  r = 0.9  indicates a strong positive correlation between the number of study hours and GPAs.
 Next,  I need to consider the given choices and see which one is a reasonable conclusion based on the correlation coefficient.  The coefficient of determination,  r^2,  is the square of the correlation coefficient and represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (in this case,  GPA) that is predictable from the independent variable (study hours).
 The coefficient of determination r^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81,  which means that 81 % of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Estrella wants to become a paramedic and takes a screening exam.  Scores on the exam have been approximately normally distributed over the years it has been given.  The exam is normed with a mean of 80  and a standard deviation of 9.  Only those who score in the top 15 % on the test are invited back for further evaluation.  Estrella received a 90  on the test.  What was her percentile rank on the test,  and did she qualify for further evaluation?  Choices: a) 13.35 ; she didn't qualify.  b) 54.38 ; she didn't qualify.  c) 86.65 ; she qualified.  d) 84.38 ; she didn't qualify.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine Estrella's percentile rank on the test.  To do this,  I will use the z-score formula: z = (X - μ) / σ, where X is Estrella's score, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.
 Plugging in the values,  I get z = (90 - 80) / 9 = 10 / 9 ≈ 1.11.
 Next,  I need to find the corresponding percentile rank for this z-score.  Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator,  I find that the percentile rank for a z-score of 1.11 is approximately 86.65 %.
 So,  Estrella's percentile rank on the test is 86.65 %.

Now,  I need to determine if she qualifies for further evaluation.  The top 15 % of test-takers are invited back for evaluation.  Since Estrella's percentile rank is 86.65 %,  she is in the top 86.65 % of test-takers.

Therefore,  Estrella qualifies for further evaluation.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: To test whether extensive exercise lowers the resting heart rate,  a study is performed by randomly selecting half of a group of volunteers to exercise 1  hour each morning,  while the rest are instructed to perform no exercise.  Is this study an experiment or an observational study?  Choices: a) An experiment with a control group and blinding b) An experiment with blocking c) An observational study with comparison and randomization d) None of the above 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine if the study is experimental or observational.  An experimental study involves manipulating an independent variable to observe its effect on a dependent variable,  while an observational study observes variables without manipulating them.
 In this case,  the study involves randomly selecting half of the volunteers to exercise and the other half not to exercise.  This is an attempt to manipulate the independent variable (exercise) to observe its effect on the dependent variable (resting heart rate).
 Next,  I need to consider the presence of a control group and blinding.  A control group is a group that does not receive the treatment,  and blinding involves hiding the treatment from participants to reduce bias.  In this study,  the control group is the volunteers who do not exercise,  and blinding is not mentioned.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"

Choices: a) Niacin lowers cholesterol an average of 18  points,  while Lipitor lowers cholesterol an average of 41  points.  b) There is a 0.95  probability that Lipitor will outperform niacin in lowering the cholesterol level of any given individual.  c) There is a 0.95  probability that Lipitor will outperform niacin by at least 23  points in lowering the cholesterol level of any given individual.  d) None of the above.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what the 95 % confidence interval means.  A 95 % confidence interval means that if we were to repeat the study many times,  95 % of the time the true difference in mean cholesterol level lowering between Lipitor and niacin would fall within the interval (18,  41 ).
 Next,  I need to evaluate each choice based on this understanding.  Choice a) states that niacin lowers cholesterol by 18  points and Lipitor by 41  points,  which is not the interpretation of a confidence interval.
 Choice b) suggests that there is a 0.95  probability that Lipitor will outperform niacin in lowering cholesterol for any given individual,  which is not correct because the confidence interval refers to the difference in means,  not the performance of individual patients.
 Choice c) states that there is a 0.95  probability that Lipitor will outperform niacin by at least 23  points,  which is also incorrect because the confidence interval only guarantees that the true difference falls within the interval (18,  41 ),  not that the difference is at least 23  points.
 Choice d) is the correct answer because none of the other choices accurately represent the meaning of the confidence interval.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Fifty oranges of one variety were selected at random and weighed.  A 95  percent confidence interval computed from the sample weights to estimate the mean weight of oranges of this variety is (7.58,  8.72 ) ounces.  Which of the following statements is true with respect to the confidence level used?  Choices: a) In repeated samplings of the same size,  95  percent of the intervals constructed will contain the true mean weight of the oranges of this variety.  b) In repeated samplings of the same size,  95  percent of the intervals constructed will contain the sampled mean weight of the oranges.  c) Ninety-five percent of the oranges in this sample weigh between 7.58  and 8.72  ounces.  d) Ninety-five percent of the oranges of this variety weigh between 7.58  and 8.72  ounces.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a confidence interval is.  A confidence interval is a range of values,  derived from sample data,  that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence.  In this case,  the confidence level is 95  percent.
 Now,  I need to analyze the given choices.  Choice a) states that in repeated samplings of the same size,  95  percent of the intervals constructed will contain the true mean weight of the oranges of this variety.  This is the definition of a confidence interval,  so it is true.
 Choice b) states that in repeated samplings of the same size,  95  percent of the intervals constructed will contain the sampled mean weight of the oranges.  This is not true,  because the confidence interval is about the true mean weight,  not the sample mean weight.
 Choice c) states that ninety-five percent of the oranges in this sample weigh between 7.58  and 8.72  ounces.  This is not true,  because the confidence interval is about the population mean,  not the sample.
 Choice d) states that ninety-five percent of the oranges of this variety weigh between 7.58  and 8.72  ounces.  This is not true,  for the same reason as choice c).
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: There are two games involving flipping a fair coin.  In the first game you win a prize if you can throw between 45 % and 55 % heads.  In the second game you win if you can throw more than 80 % heads.  For each game would you rather flip the coin 30  times or 300  times?  Choices: a) 30  times for each game b) 300  times for each game c) 30  times for the first game and 300  times for the second d) 300  times for the first game and 30  times for the second 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the first game where you need to throw between 45% and 55% heads. With fewer flips (30), the outcome is more likely to be influenced by chance, making it less predictable. With more flips (300), the outcome is more likely to reflect the true probability of heads, which is 50%. Therefore, it's better to flip the coin 300 times for the first game.

Next, let's consider the second game where you need to throw more than 80% heads. This is a much stricter condition, and it's highly unlikely to achieve this with fewer flips (30) due to the law of large numbers. With more flips (300), the probability of getting more than 80% heads decreases, but it's still more feasible than with only 30 flips. Therefore, it's better to flip the coin 300 times for the second game as well.

Based on the analysis, the best choice is to flip the coin 300 times for both games. So, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A company is interested in comparing the mean sales revenue per salesperson at two different locations.  The manager takes a random sample of 10  salespeople from each location independently and records the sales revenue generated by each person during the last four weeks.  He decides to use a t-test to compare the mean sales revenue at the two locations.  Which of the following assumptions is necessary for the validity of the t-test?  Choices: a) The population standard deviations at both locations are equal.  b) The population standard deviations at both locations are not equal.  c) The population standard deviations at both locations are known.  d) The population of the sales records at each location is normally distributed.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the assumptions required for a t-test.  A t-test is used to compare the means of two independent samples.  The main assumptions are:
 1. The samples are independent.
 2. The population distribution is normal or the sample size is large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to apply.
 3. The population standard deviations are equal.
 4. The data is quantitative.

 Given the choices,  the necessary assumption for the validity of the t-test is that the population of the sales records at each location is normally distributed.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Suppose you did 10  independent tests of the form H0 : μ = 25  versus Ha: μ < 25,  each at the α = 0.05  significance level.  What is the probability of committing a Type I error and incorrectly rejecting a true H0  with at least one of the 10  tests?  Choices: a) 0.05  b) 0.40  c) 0.50  d) 0.60  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand that the probability of committing a Type I error (rejecting a true H0) in a single test is α = 0.05.
 Next,  I need to consider the probability of not committing a Type I error in a single test.  This is 1 - α = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.
 Now,  I need to find the probability of not committing a Type I error in all 10 tests.  This is (0.95)^10 ≈ 0.5987.
 To find the probability of committing at least one Type I error,  I subtract the probability of not committing any errors from 1: 1 - 0.5987 ≈ 0.4013.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Suppose that 60 % of a particular electronic part last over 3  years,  while 70 % last less than 6  years.  Assuming a normal distribution,  what are the mean and standard deviation with regard to length of life of these parts?  Choices: a) μ = 3.677,  σ = 3.561  b) μ = 3.977,  σ = 3.861  c) μ = 4.177,  σ = 3.561  d) μ = 4.377,  σ = 3.261  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the mean (μ) of the distribution.  Since 60 % of the parts last over 3  years,  this means that 40 % last 3  years or less.  Using the normal distribution table or calculator,  I can find the z-score corresponding to 40 %, which is approximately -0.25.  Then,  I can use the formula z = (x - μ) / σ to find the mean: -0.25 = (3 - μ) / σ.
 Next,For the second part,  I need to find the mean (μ) of the distribution.  Since 70 % of the parts last less than 6  years,  this means that 30 % last 6  years or more.  Using the normal distribution table or calculator,  I can find the z-score corresponding to 30 %, which is approximately 0.52.  Then,  I can use the formula z = (x - μ) / σ to find the mean: 0.52 = (6 - μ) / σ.
 Now,  I have two equations with two unknowns (μ and σ).  I can solve this system of equations to find the values of μ and σ.  Multiplying the first equation by σ,  I get -0.25σ = 3 - μ.  Adding this to the second equation,  I get 0.52σ = 6 - μ.  Adding these two equations,  I get 0.27σ = 9.The answer is c) μ = 4.177, σ = 3.561.The answer is c) μ = 4.177, σ = 3.561.

"Input: A psychologist believes that positive rewards for proper behavior are more effective than punishment for bad behavior in promoting good behavior in children.  A scale of ""proper behavior"" is developed.  μ1 = the ""proper behavior"" rating for children receiving positive rewards,  and μ2 = the ""proper behavior"" rating for children receiving punishment.  If H0 : μ1 − μ2 = 0,  which of the following is the proper statement of HA?  Choices: a) HA: μ1 − μ2 > 0  b) HA: μ1 − μ2 < 0  c) HA: μ1 − μ2 ≠ 0  d) Any of the above is an acceptable alternative to the given null.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (HA).  The null hypothesis states that there is no difference between the ""proper behavior"" ratings for children receiving positive rewards and those receiving punishment,  which is represented as H0 : μ1 − μ2 = 0.
 The psychologist believes that positive rewards are more effective than punishment,  so the alternative hypothesis should state that there is a difference in favor of positive rewards.  This means that the ""proper behavior"" rating for children receiving positive rewards (μ1) should be greater than the ""proper behavior"" rating for children receiving punishment (μ2).
 Therefore,  the proper statement of HA is that the difference between the two means is greater than zero: HA: μ1 − μ2 > 0.

"Input: A confidence interval estimate is determined from the monthly grocery expenditures in a random sample of n families.  Which of the following will result in a smaller margin of error?  I.  A smaller confidence level.  II.  A smaller sample standard deviation.  III.  A smaller sample size Choices: a) II only b) I and II c) I and III d) II and III 
 Output:
 First, let's consider the formula for the margin of error for a confidence interval of a sample mean: E = Z * (σ / √n), where E is the margin of error, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, σ is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.

Now, let's analyze each option:

I. A smaller confidence level: A smaller confidence level corresponds to a smaller Z-score. Since the Z-score is in the numerator, a smaller Z-score will result in a smaller margin of error.

II. A smaller sample standard deviation: A smaller sample standard deviation means that the data points are closer to the mean, which will result in a smaller margin of error.

III. A smaller sample size: A smaller sample size means a larger √n in the denominator, which will result in a larger margin of error.

Therefore, the options that will result in a smaller margin of error are I and II. So, the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following is not important in the design of experiments?  Choices: a) Control of confounding variables b) Randomization in assigning subjects to different treatments c) Use of a confounding variable to control the placebo effect d) Replication of the experiment using sufficient numbers of subjects 
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze each choice and determine which one is not important in the design of experiments.
 a) Control of confounding variables is important because it helps to ensure that the observed effects are due to the treatment and not other factors.
 b) Randomization in assigning subjects to different treatments is important because it helps to reduce bias and increase the likelihood of obtaining valid results.
 c) Use of a confounding variable to control the placebo effect is not necessarily important, as the placebo effect can be controlled through other means, such as blinding.
 d) Replication of the experiment using sufficient numbers of subjects is important because it helps to ensure that the results are reliable and can be generalized to the population.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which of the following is a correct statement?  Choices: a) The probability of a Type II error does not depend on the probability of a Type I error.  b) In conducting a hypothesis test,  it is possible to simultaneously make both a Type I and a Type II error.  c) A Type II error will result if one incorrectly assumes the data are normally distributed.  d) When you choose a significance level α,  you're setting the probability of a Type I error to exactly α.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the definitions of Type I and Type II errors.  A Type I error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true,  and the probability of this error is denoted by α.  A Type II error occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false,  and the probability of this error is denoted by β.
 Now,  I will analyze each choice:
 a) The probability of a Type II error does not depend on the probability of a Type I error.  This statement is true because the probability of a Type II error (β) is influenced by the sample size, the effect size, and the true population parameter,  and not directly by the probability of a Type I error (α).
 b) In conducting a hypothesis test,  it is possible to simultaneously make both a Type I and a Type II error.  This statement is false because a Type I and a Type II error are mutually exclusive.  You can either reject the null hypothesis when it is true (Type I error) or fail to reject it when it is false (Type II error),  but not both at the same time.
 c) A Type II error will result if one incorrectly assumes the data are normally distributed.  This statement is false because a Type II error depends on the true population parameter,  the sample size,  and the effect size,  and not on the assumption of normality.
 d) When you choose a significance level α,  you're setting the probability of a Type I error to exactly α.  This statement is true because the significance level α is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true,  which is the definition of a Type I error.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Define a new measurement as the difference between the 60 th and 40 th percentile scores in a population.  This measurement will give information concerning Choices: a) central tendency.  b) variability.  c) symmetry.  d) skewness.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what the 60 th and 40 th percentile scores represent.  The 60 th percentile score is the value below which 60% of the data falls,  and the 40 th percentile score is the value below which 40% of the data falls.
 The difference between these two percentiles is a measure of the dispersion or spread of the data.  It gives information about how the data is distributed around the middle values.
 Now,  I need to consider the choices given.  a) central tendency refers to the location of the middle value(s) in the data set,  b) variability refers to the spread of the data,  c) symmetry refers to whether the data is evenly distributed around the median,  and d) skewness refers to the asymmetry of the data distribution.
 Based on the definition of the new measurement,  it gives information about the spread of the data,  which corresponds to the concept of variability.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following is notrequired in a binomial setting?  Choices: a) Each trial is considered either a success or a failure.  b) Each trial is independent.  c) The value of the random variable of interest is the number of trials until the first success occurs.  d) There is a fixed number of trials.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the characteristics of a binomial setting.  A binomial setting is characterized by a fixed number of independent trials,  each with two possible outcomes (success or failure).
 Next,  I will go through the choices and see which one is not required in a binomial setting.
 a) Each trial is considered either a success or a failure.  This is a requirement,  as binomial settings have two possible outcomes.
 b) Each trial is independent.  This is also a requirement,  as binomial settings have independent trials.
 c) The value of the random variable of interest is the number of trials until the first success occurs.  This is not a requirement for a binomial setting.  Binomial settings are characterized by the number of successes in a fixed number of trials,  not the number of trials until the first success.
 d) There is a fixed number of trials.  This is a requirement,  as binomial settings have a fixed number of trials.

"Input: A publisher used standard boxes for shipping books.  The mean weight of books packed per box is 25  pounds,  with a standard deviation of two pounds.  The mean weight of the boxes is one pound,  with a standard deviation of 0.15  pounds.  The mean weight of the packing material used per box is two pounds,  with a standard deviation of 0.25  pounds.  What is the standard deviation of the weights of the packed boxes?  Choices: a) 28.000  pounds b) 5.290  pounds c) 4.085  pounds d) 2.021  pounds 
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the total weight of the packed boxes.  The weight of the books is 25  pounds,  the weight of the boxes is one pound,  and the weight of the packing material is two pounds.  So,  the total weight is 25  + 1  + 2  = 28  pounds.
 Next,  I need to calculate the standard deviation of the weights of the packed boxes.  Since the weights of the books,  boxes,  and packing material are independent,  I can use the formula for the standard deviation of the sum of independent variables: √(σ_books^2 + σ_boxes^2 + σ_material^2).
 The standard deviation of the weights of the books is two pounds,  the standard deviation of the weights of the boxes is 0.15  pounds,  and the standard deviation of the weights of the packing material is 0.25  pounds.
 So,  the standard deviation of the weights of the packed boxes is √(2^2 + 0.15^2 + 0.25^2) = √(4 + 0.0225 + 0.0625) = √(4.085) ≈ 2.021  pounds.

"Input: A group of scientists wanted to estimate the proportion of geese returning to the same site for the next breeding season.  Suppose they decided to increase the sample size from 200  to 2,000.  How will this affect the distribution of the sample proportion?  Choices: a) The distribution of the sample proportion will be more spread out.  b) The distribution of the sample proportion will be less spread out.  c) The spread of the distribution of the sample proportion will remain unaffected.  d) The distribution of the sample proportion will more closely resemble the binomial distribution.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the Central Limit Theorem,  which states that as the sample size increases,  the distribution of the sample proportion will become more normal,  regardless of the shape of the population distribution.
 Next,  I need to consider the effect of increasing the sample size from 200  to 2,000.  According to the Central Limit Theorem,  a larger sample size will lead to a more normal distribution.
 Additionally,  the standard deviation of the distribution of the sample proportion is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size.  So,  increasing the sample size will decrease the standard deviation,  which means the distribution will be less spread out.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A telephone survey of 400  registered voters showed that 256  had not yet made up their minds 1  month before the election.  How sure can we be that between 60 % and 68 % of the electorate were still undecided at that time?  Choices: a) 2.4 % b) 8.0 % c) 64.0 % d) 90.4 % 
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the sample proportion of undecided voters.  There were 256  undecided voters out of 400  total voters,  so the proportion is 256  ÷ 400  = 0.64 .
 Next,  I need to calculate the margin of error for a 95 % confidence interval.  The formula for the margin of error is:
 margin of error = 1.96 * sqrt((p * (1 - p)) / n)
 where p is the sample proportion and n is the sample size.
 Plugging in the values,  I get:
 margin of error = 1.96 * sqrt((0.64 * (1 - 0.64)) / 400) = 1.96 * sqrt((0.64 * 0.36) / 400) = 1.96 * sqrt(0.2304 / 400) = 1.96 * sqrt(0.000576) = 1.96 * 0.024 = 0.047.
 The margin of error is 0.047,  or 4.7 %.
 Now,  I need to check if the margin of error falls within the desired range of 60 % to 68 %.  The lower bound is 0.60 - 0.047 = 0.553,  and the upper bound is 0.68 + 0.047 = 0.727.
 Since both the lower and upper bounds are within the desired range,  we can be sure that between 60 % and 68 % of the electorate were still undecided at that time.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Players in the National Football League weigh,  on average,  about 248  pounds with a standard deviation of about 47  pounds.  If four players are to be selected at random,  the expected value of the random variable W,  the total combined weight of the four players,  is 992  pounds.  The standard deviation of Wis approximately Choices: a) 47  pounds b) 67  pounds c) 94  pounds d) 141  pounds 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand that the expected value of the random variable W,  the total combined weight of the four players,  is the sum of the expected values of each individual player.  Since each player has an expected weight of 248  pounds,  the expected value of W is 248  * 4  = 992  pounds.
 Next,  I need to consider the standard deviation of W.  Since the weights of the players are independent,  the standard deviation of W is the square root of the sum of the variances of the individual players.  The variance of each player is the square of the standard deviation,  so the variance of each player is 47^2 = 2209  pounds^2.
 The sum of the variances of the four players is 2209  * 4  = 8836  pounds^2.
 The standard deviation of W is the square root of the sum of the variances,  so the standard deviation of W is √8836  = 94  pounds.

 Output:
 First,  let's analyze each choice:
 a) The categories are not numerical for either variable - This is true,  since contingency tables are used for categorical data,  not numerical data.
 b) Observed frequencies should be whole numbers - This is also true,  since observed frequencies represent counts of cases,  and counts must be whole numbers.
 c) Expected frequencies should be whole numbers - This is not necessarily true,  since expected frequencies are calculated based on probabilities,  which can be decimal values.
 d) Expected frequencies in each cell should be at least 5,  and to achieve this,  one sometimes combines categories for one or the other or both of the variables - This is true,  as it is a rule of thumb to ensure that the chi-square test is appropriate.

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a z-score represents.  A z-score measures how many standard deviations an observation is from the mean.  A negative z-score indicates that the observation is below the mean.
 In this case,  the z-score is –2,  which means the runner's time this week is 2 standard deviations below the mean marathon running time.
 Now,  I need to find the statement that correctly interprets the z-score.  The correct interpretation is that his time this week was two standard deviations lower than his average time.

"Input: The mean Law School Aptitude Test (LSAT) score for applicants to a particular law school is 650  with a standard deviation of 45.  Suppose that only applicants with scores above 700  are considered.  What percentage of the applicants considered have scores below 740?  (Assume the scores are normally distributed. ) Choices: a) 13.3 % b) 17.1 % c) 82.9 % d) 86.7 % 
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the z-score for a score of 740.  The z-score is calculated as (X - μ) / σ, where X is the score, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.  So,  the z-score for a score of 740 is (740 - 650) / 45 = 1.96.
 Next,  I need to find the z-score for a score of 700.  The z-score for a score of 700 is (700 - 650) / 45 = 1.11.
 Now,  I need to find the area under the normal distribution curve between these two z-scores.  This can be found using a standard normal distribution table or calculator.  The area between z = 1.11 and z = 1.96 is approximately 0.1709.
 To find the percentage of applicants with scores below 740 who are considered, I multiply the area by 100: 0.1709 * 100 = 17.09%, which is approximately 17.1%.

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the percentiles.  Mary scored at the 64 th percentile,  which means she scored higher than 64 % of the test-takers.
 Pam scored at the 56 th percentile,  which means she scored higher than 56 % of the test-takers.
 Now,  I will analyze the choices:
 a) Mary scored eight more points than Pam.  This statement is not necessarily true,  as we don't have information about the actual scores or the score distribution.
 b) Mary's score is 8 % higher than Pam's.  This statement is also not necessarily true,  as the difference in percentiles does not directly translate to a percentage difference in scores.
 c) Eight percent of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary.  This statement is true,  as the difference in percentiles between Mary and Pam is 64 - 56 = 8,  which means 8 % of the test-takers scored between them.

 First,  I need to consider the nature of the study and its limitations.  The study is observational,  meaning it observed the patients and their habits without manipulating any variables.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the possible confounding variables.  Both options a) and b) suggest that there might be other factors that could explain the lower incidence of depression in patients who drink green tea.

"Input: A researcher planning a survey of school principals in a particular state has lists of the school principals employed in each of the 125  school districts.  The procedure is to obtain a random sample of principals from each of the districts rather than grouping all the lists together and obtaining a sample from the entire group.  Which of the following is a correct conclusion?  Choices: a) This is a simple random sample obtained in an easier and less costly manner than procedures involving sampling from the entire population of principals.  b) This is a cluster sample in which the population was divided into heterogeneous groups called clusters.  c) This is an example of systematic sampling,  which gives a reasonable sample as long as the original order of the list is not related to the variables under consideration.  d) This is a stratified sample,  which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the procedure described.  The researcher is obtaining a random sample of principals from each of the 125  districts,  rather than obtaining a sample from the entire group of principals.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given and determine which one correctly describes the procedure.
 a) This is a simple random sample obtained in an easier and less costly manner than procedures involving sampling from the entire population of principals.  - This choice describes a method that is easier and less costly than sampling from the entire population,  which could be true for the described procedure.
 b) This is a cluster sample in which the population was divided into heterogeneous groups called clusters.  - This choice describes a cluster sample,  but the population was not divided into heterogeneous groups.  The districts are homogeneous within themselves.
 c) This is an example of systematic sampling,  which gives a reasonable sample as long as the original order of the list is not related to the variables under consideration.  - This choice describes systematic sampling,  but the procedure described does not involve a systematic selection method.
 d) This is a stratified sample,  which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.  - This choice describes a stratified sample,  which is a method of dividing the population into groups (strata) and then taking a random sample from each group.  The described procedure fits this description, as the population is divided into 125  districts and a random sample is taken from each district.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: In an experiment,  the control group should receive Choices: a) treatment opposite that given the experimental group.  b) the same treatment given the experimental group without knowing they are receiving the treatment.  c) a procedure identical to that given the experimental group except for receiving the treatment under examination.  d) a procedure identical to that given the experimental group except for a random decision on receiving the treatment under examination.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the purpose of the control group in an experiment.  The control group is used to compare the effects of the treatment under examination.
 Next,  I need to consider the options given for the control group.  Option a suggests giving the opposite treatment to the experimental group,  which is not the typical approach as it does not allow for a direct comparison.
 Option b suggests giving the same treatment to the control group without informing them,  which is not the correct approach as it does not allow for a controlled comparison.
 Option c suggests giving the control group a procedure identical to the experimental group except for the treatment under examination,  which is the correct approach as it allows for a controlled comparison.
 Option d suggests giving the control group a procedure identical to the experimental group except for a random decision on receiving the treatment,  which is not the correct approach as it does not allow for a controlled comparison.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Tina’s science fair project was to estimate the mean amount of chemicals in her city’s water supply.  At first,  she had decided to use a random sample of 15  observations.  But her teacher asked her to take 35  observations.  The mean and standard deviation from 35  observations turned out to be approximately the same as those from 15  observations.  Is there any advantage in using 35  observations instead of 15  observations?  Choices: a) There is no advantage.  Because the mean and the standard deviation are about the same,  the confidence interval computed using 35  observations should be approximately the same as that computed using 15  observations.  b) There is no advantage.  In fact,  the 20  extra observations will increase the likelihood of error.  c) There is no advantage.  Because she took 35  observations instead of 15  observations,  the confidence interval using 35  observations will be wider than that using 15  observations.  d) There is some advantage.  Because she took 35  observations instead of 15  observations,  the confidence interval using 35  observations will be narrower than that using 15  observations.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the effect of increasing the sample size on the confidence interval.  The width of the confidence interval is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size.  So,  if the sample size increases,  the width of the confidence interval decreases.
 Next,  I need to consider the given information that the mean and standard deviation from 35  observations are approximately the same as those from 15  observations.  This means that the variability in the data is similar,  regardless of the sample size.
 Therefore,  the advantage of using 35  observations instead of 15  observations is that the confidence interval using 35  observations will be narrower than that using 15  observations.  This is because the sample size is larger,  which reduces the width of the confidence interval.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The total cholesterol level in a large population of people is strongly skewed right with a mean of 210  mg/dL and a standard deviation of 15  mg/dL.  If random samples of size 16  are repeatedly drawn from this population,  which of the following appropriately describes the sampling distribution of these sample means?  Choices: a) The shape is unknown with a mean of 210  and a standard deviation of 15.  b) The shape is somewhat skewed right with a mean of 210  and a standard deviation of 3.75.  c) The shape is approximately normal with a mean of 210  and a standard deviation of 15.  d) The shape is approximately normal with a mean of 210  and a standard deviation of 3.75.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the Central Limit Theorem,  which states that the sampling distribution of the sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases,  given that the population is normally distributed or the sample size is large enough.  In this case,  the sample size is 16,  which is not very large,  but the population is strongly skewed right.  However,  the Central Limit Theorem still applies because the sample size is greater than 30.
 Next,  I need to consider the mean of the sampling distribution of the sample means,  which is equal to the population mean.  In this case,  the mean is 210  mg/dL.
 Finally,  I need to consider the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample means,  which is called the standard error and is calculated by dividing the population standard deviation by the square root of the sample size.  In this case,  the standard error is 15  mg/dL ÷ sqrt(16) = 15  mg/dL ÷ 4 = 3.75  mg/dL.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: An experiment is conducted in which the response variable is the average gain in participants' performance in the long jump.  A two-sample t-test with a 5 % level of significance will be used to analyze the results.  If all else is kept the same,  which of the following descriptions of a possible change in procedure is true?  Choices: a) Change from equal size treatment groups to very different size treatment groups would increase the power of the test.  b) Change from a 5 % significance level to a 1 % significance level would increase the power of the test.  c) Taking more careful measurements to reduce variability in the response would increase the power of the test.  d) Increasing the sample size would reduce the probability of a Type I error.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the effect of each change on the power of the test.  The power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.
 a) Changing from equal size treatment groups to very different size treatment groups would affect the balance of the groups and might not necessarily increase the power of the test.  So,  this option is not necessarily true.
 b) Changing from a 5 % significance level to a 1 % significance level would decrease the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true,  which means it would decrease the power of the test.  So,  this option is not true.
 c) Taking more careful measurements to reduce variability in the response would increase the precision of the measurements and make it easier to detect a difference if one exists,  which would increase the power of the test.  So,  this option is true.
 d) Increasing the sample size would decrease the standard error of the mean,  which would make it easier to detect a difference if one exists,  but it would not directly affect the probability of a Type I error.  So,  this option is not true.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: An assembly line machine is supposed to turn out ball bearings with a diameter of 1.25  centimeters.  Each morning the first 30  bearings produced are pulled and measured.  If their mean diameter is under 1.23  centimeters or over 1.27  centimeters,  the machinery is stopped and an engineer is called to make adjustments before production is resumed.  The quality control procedure may be viewed as a hypothesis test with the null hypothesis H0 : μ = 1.25  and the alternative hypothesis Ha: μ ≠ 1.25.  The engineer is asked to make adjustments when the null hypothesis is rejected.  In test terminology,  what would a Type II error result in?  Choices: a) A warranted halt in production to adjust the machinery b) An unnecessary stoppage of the production process c) Continued production of wrong size ball bearings d) Continued production of proper size ball bearings 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the meaning of a Type II error in hypothesis testing.  A Type II error occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.
 In this context,  the null hypothesis H0 is that the mean diameter of the ball bearings is 1.25  centimeters,  and the alternative hypothesis Ha is that the mean diameter is not 1.25  centimeters.
 A Type II error would mean that the machinery is not adjusted even though the mean diameter is not actually 1.25  centimeters.
 This would result in continued production of ball bearings with the wrong size.
 Therefore,  a Type II error would result in continued production of wrong size ball bearings.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: We are interested in the proportion p of people who are unemployed in a large city.  Eight percent of a simple random sample of 500  people are unemployed.  What is the midpoint for a 95 % confidence interval estimate of p?  Choices: a) 0.012  b) 0.025  c) 0.475  d) None of the above.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the sample proportion of unemployed people,  which is 8  percent of 500  people.  So,  the sample proportion is 0.08  * 500  = 40  people.
 Next,  I need to calculate the standard error of the sample proportion.  The formula for the standard error is sqrt[(p(1-p)/n)],  where p is the sample proportion and n is the sample size.  In this case,  p = 0.08  and n = 500.
 The standard error is sqrt[(0.08 * (1 - 0.08) / 500)] = sqrt[0.0001472] = 0.0121.
 To find the 95 % confidence interval,  I need to use the z-score for a 95 % confidence level,  which is 1.96.
 The margin of error is 1.96 * 0.0121 = 0.023876.
 The confidence interval is (0.08 - 0.023876,  0.08 + 0.023876) = (0.056124,  0.103876).
 The midpoint of the confidence interval is (0.056124 + 0.103876) / 2 = 0.0799.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: An insurance company wishes to study the number of years drivers in a large city go between automobile accidents.  They plan to obtain and analyze the data from a sample of drivers.  Which of the following is a true statement?  Choices: a) A reasonable time-and-cost-saving procedure would be to use systematic sampling on an available list of all AAA (Automobile Association of America) members in the city.  b) A reasonable time-and-cost-saving procedure would be to randomly choose families and include all drivers in each of these families in the sample.  c) To determine the mean number of years between accidents,  randomness in choosing a sample of drivers is not important as long as the sample size is very large.  d) None of the above are true statements.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the options and their feasibility in terms of time and cost.  Option a suggests using systematic sampling on an available list of all AAA members.  This could be a time-and-cost-saving procedure because it requires less effort to select a sample from a pre-existing list compared to randomly selecting drivers.
 Option b suggests randomly choosing families and including all drivers in each of these families.  This could be costly and time-consuming because it would require identifying and contacting families, and then collecting data from all drivers in those families.
 Option c suggests that randomness is not important as long as the sample size is very large.  This is not a true statement because even with a large sample size, randomness is important to ensure the sample is representative of the population.
 Option d suggests that none of the above are true statements.  This is not true because option a is a true statement.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following is the central limit theorem?  Choices: a) No matter how the population is distributed,  as the sample size increases,  the mean of the sample means becomes closer to the mean of the population.  b) No matter how the population is distributed,  as the sample size increases,  the standard deviation of the sample means becomes closer to the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size.  c) If the population is normally distributed,  then as the sample size increases,  the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes closer to a normal distribution.  d) The central limit theorem refers to something else.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what the central limit theorem is.  The central limit theorem states that,  regardless of the distribution of the population,  as the sample size increases,  the distribution of the sample means approaches a normal distribution,  with the mean of the sample means equal to the population mean and the standard deviation of the sample means equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.
 Comparing this to the given choices,  I can see that choice a) describes the convergence of the mean of the sample means to the population mean,  and choice b) describes the convergence of the standard deviation of the sample means to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.  Choice c) specifically mentions the case when the population is normally distributed.
 However,  the central limit theorem does not specify that the population must be normally distributed.  It applies to any population distribution.  Therefore,  the most accurate description of the central limit theorem is the combination of a) and b),  which is not one of the given choices.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A manufacturer of ready-bake cake mixes is interested in designing an experiment to test the effects of four different temperature levels (300,  325,  350,  and 375 F),  two different types of pans (glass and metal),  and three different types of ovens (gas,  electric,  and microwave) on the texture of its cakes,  in all combinations.  Which of the following below is the best description of the design of the necessary experiment?  Choices: a) A completely randomized design with nine treatment groups b) A completely randomized design with 24  treatment groups c) A randomized block design,  blocked on temperature,  with six treatment groups d) A randomized block design,  blocked on type of pan,  with 12  treatment groups 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the total number of treatment groups.  The experiment has four different temperature levels,  two different types of pans,  and three different types of ovens.  To find the total number of treatment groups,  I multiply the number of levels for each factor: 4  * 2  * 3  = 24  treatment groups.
 Next,  I need to consider the design of the experiment.  A completely randomized design involves assigning treatments to experimental units in a random order,  without any blocking.  A randomized block design involves grouping similar units together and then randomly assigning treatments within each group.
 In this case,  the best design is a completely randomized design with 24  treatment groups,  since there is no mention of any similarity between the units that would justify blocking.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A study is made to determine whether more hours of academic studying leads to higher point scoring by basketball players.  In surveying 50  basketball players,  it is noted that the 25  who claim to study the most hours have a higher point average than the 25  who study less.  Based on this study,  the coach begins requiring the players to spend more time studying.  Which of the following is a correct statement?  Choices: a) While this study may have its faults,  it still does prove causation.  b) There could well be a confounding variable responsible for the seeming relationship.  c) While this is a controlled experiment,  the conclusion of the coach is not justified.  d) To get the athletes to study more,  it would be more meaningful to have them put in more practice time on the court to boost their point averages,  as higher point averages seem to be associated with more study time.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the nature of the study and its potential limitations.  The study is comparing two groups of players: those who claim to study the most hours and those who study less.  The observed outcome is that the group that claims to study the most has a higher point average.

Next,  I need to consider the possibility of confounding variables.  A confounding variable is a factor that could influence both the independent and dependent variables,  potentially leading to a spurious correlation.  In this case,  it is possible that the confounding variable could be talent,  athleticism,  or previous experience,  which could lead to both higher study claims and higher point averages.

Now,  I need to consider the conclusion drawn by the coach.  The coach is basing his decision to require more studying on the observed correlation between study hours and point averages.

Therefore,  the correct statement is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Biologists around the world have increased efforts at conservation.  Monitoring wildlife populations is important so that appropriate management efforts can be implemented,  but such monitoring is often difficult.  One study found a cheap and easy way to estimate the number of nesting sites of terns (a type of seabird) by monitoring the number of calls heard per minute.  More calls happen when there are more birds,  as one would expect.  In fact,  it turned out that the number of calls explained 71 % of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites.  Which of the following statements is correct about the correlation between the number of calls and the abundance of nests?  Choices: a) The correlation coefficient is -0.71.  b) The correlation coefficient is 0.71.  c) The correlation coefficient is -0.84.  d) The correlation coefficient is 0.84.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the given information.  The number of calls explained 71 % of the variation in the abundance of nests.  This means that the correlation between the number of calls and the abundance of nests is strong and positive.
 Next,  I need to recall the formula for the correlation coefficient,  which is r = √r², where r is the coefficient of determination (the square of the correlation coefficient).  In this case,  r = 0.71.
 Therefore,  the correlation coefficient is r = √0.71² = 0.71.

"Input: A company has 1000  employees evenly distributed throughout five assembly plants.  A sample of 30  employees is to be chosen as follows.  Each of the five managers will be asked to place the 200  time cards of their respective employees in a bag,  shake them up,  and randomly draw out six names.  The six names from each plant will be put together to make up the sample.  Will this method result in a simple random sample of the 1000  employees?  Choices: a) Yes,  because every employee has the same chance of being selected.  b) Yes,  because every plant is equally represented.  c) Yes,  because this is an example of stratified sampling,  which is a special case of simple random sampling.  d) No,  because not every group of 30  employees has the same chance of being selected.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a simple random sample is.  A simple random sample is a subset of individuals chosen from a larger set,  in such a way that every possible subset is equally likely to be the result.  In this case,  every employee should have an equal chance of being selected.
 Next,  I need to analyze the method described.  Each plant has 200  employees,  and 6  names are randomly drawn from each plant.  This means that each plant is equally represented in the sample.
 However,  I also need to consider the overall method.  Since the selection within each plant is random,  but the selection across plants is not (because the same group of 30  employees cannot be selected more than once),  the method does not result in a simple random sample.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A doctor hopes that a new surgery technique will shorten the recovery time compared to the standard technique.  To test this,  he designed an experiment in which patients who required this type of surgery were randomly assigned to the standard technique or the new technique.  Then the mean recovery time for each treatment group was compared.  Assuming conditions for inference were met,  which analysis should be used?  Choices: a) A t-test for a mean.  b) A t-test for a difference in means.  c) A z-test for a mean.  d) A z-test for a difference in means.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the type of data being compared.  In this case,  we are comparing the mean recovery time for two different groups: the standard technique and the new technique.
 Next,  I need to consider the type of analysis that compares means.  A t-test is used when comparing a sample mean to a known population mean,  while a z-test is used when the sample size is large enough that the Central Limit Theorem can be applied.
 Since we are comparing two means,  I can eliminate options a) and c) because they only involve a single mean.
 Now,  I need to consider the context of the experiment.  The patients were randomly assigned to the standard technique or the new technique,  so we have two independent samples.
 Therefore,  the correct analysis to use is a t-test for a difference in means.  The answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A researcher plans a study to examine long-term confidence in the U. S.  economy among the adult population.  She obtains a simple random sample of 30  adults as they leave a Wall Street office building one weekday afternoon.  All but two of the adults agree to participate in the survey.  Which of the following conclusions is correct?  Choices: a) Proper use of chance as evidenced by the simple random sample makes this a well-designed survey.  b) The high response rate makes this a well-designed survey.  c) Selection bias makes this a poorly designed survey.  d) A voluntary response study like this gives too much emphasis to persons with strong opinions.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the method of selecting the sample.  The researcher used a simple random sample,  which means each adult in the population had an equal chance of being selected.  This is a proper use of chance.
 Next,  I need to consider the response rate.  All but two of the adults agreed to participate,  which is a high response rate.
 However,  I also need to consider the nature of the sample.  The researcher obtained the sample from a Wall Street office building,  which means the sample is not representative of the adult population in the U. S.  as a whole.  This introduces selection bias.

 Output:
 First,  we need to identify the control group.  The control group should be similar to the experimental groups in all ways except for the variable being tested,  which in this case is the type of music.
 Next,  we need to evaluate the choices given.  Choice a) A third group for which no music is played,  would be the most similar to the experimental groups in all other aspects except for the type of music.
 Choice b) A third group that randomly hears either classical or light rock music each day,  would not be similar to the experimental groups as it introduces variability in the type of music.
 Choice c) A third group that hears day-long R & B music,  would be different from the experimental groups in the type of music,  but not necessarily in a way that would isolate the effect of classical or light rock music.
 Choice d) A third group that hears classical music every morning and light rock every afternoon,  would not be similar to the experimental groups as it introduces a different pattern of music exposure.

"Input: During the years 1886  through 2000  there were an average of 8.7  tropical cyclones per year,  of which an average of 5.1  became hurricanes.  Assuming that the probability of any cyclone becoming a hurricane is independent of what happens to any other cyclone,  if there are five cyclones in one year,  what is the probability that at least three become hurricanes?  Choices: a) 0.313  b) 0.345  c) 0.586  d) 0.658  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the probability of a cyclone becoming a hurricane.  The probability is the ratio of hurricanes to total cyclones: 5.1  ÷ 8.7  ≈ 0.586  or 58.6%.
 Next,  I need to calculate the probability of a cyclone not becoming a hurricane,  which is 1  - 0.586  = 0.414  or 41.4%.
 Now,  I need to calculate the probability of at least three cyclones becoming hurricanes.  This can happen in three ways: exactly three cyclones become hurricanes,  exactly four become hurricanes,  or all five become hurricanes.
 The probability of exactly three becoming hurricanes is given by the binomial probability formula: C(5,3) * (0.586)^3 * (0.414)^2 ≈ 0.313.
 The probability of exactly four becoming hurricanes is: C(5,4) * (0.586)^4 * (0.414)^1 ≈ 0.110.
 The probability of all five becoming hurricanes is: (0.586)^5 ≈ 0.058.
 To find the total probability of at least three becoming hurricanes,  I add these probabilities: 0.313 + 0.110 + 0.058 = 0.481.

 First,  I need to calculate the degrees of freedom for a chi-squared test of independence.  The formula for degrees of freedom in a contingency table is (r-1) * (c-1),  where r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns.
 In this case,  the table has 3  rows and 4  columns,  so the degrees of freedom are (3-1) * (4-1) = 2  * 3  = 6.

"Input: At a large hospital,  the durations of emergency room visits,  from check-in to discharge,  are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 167  minutes and a standard deviation of 76  minutes.  Which interval,  to the nearest minute,  contains the middle 80 % of durations?  Choices: a) 15  minutes to 319  minutes b) 53  minutes to 281  minutes c) 70  minutes to 264  minutes d) 91  minutes to 243  minutes 
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the z-scores that correspond to the 10th and 90th percentiles of the normal distribution,  since the middle 80 % of the data lies between these percentiles.
 Using a z-table or calculator,  I find that the z-score for the 10th percentile is approximately -1.28 and the z-score for the 90th percentile is approximately 1.28.
 Next,  I need to convert these z-scores to actual durations in minutes.  To do this,  I use the formula: duration = mean + (z-score * standard deviation).

"Input: The relation between studying time (in hours) and grade on a final exam (0 -100 ) in a random sample of students in math class was found to be Grade = 50.25  + 10.2  (h) How will a student’s grade be affected if she studies for two hours?  Choices: a) Her grade will go up by 40.05  points.  b) Her grade will go up by 20.4  points.  c) Her grade will remain unchanged.  d) Her grade will down by 10.2  points.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the given equation: Grade = 50.25  + 10.2  (h).  This equation represents the relationship between the number of hours a student studies (h) and the resulting grade on the final exam.

 Next,  I need to find out how much the grade will change if the student studies for two additional hours.  Since the equation shows that the grade increases by 10.2  points for each hour of study,  I can calculate the change in grade by multiplying the number of additional hours (2) by the rate of increase (10.2  points/hour).

 The change in grade is 2  * 10.2  = 20.4  points.

 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A producer of skin care products has created a new formula for its cream to cure acne.  To compare the effectiveness of the new cream to that of the old cream,  it conducted a double-blind randomized experiment.  Volunteers with acne tried the old formula on one side of their face and the new formula on the other,  and which side got which formula was determined randomly.  The response variable was the difference in the number of pimples (old formula - new formula).  Which is the correct significance test to perform?  Choices: a) A two-proportion z-test b) A two-sample t-test c) A matched pairs t-test d) A chi-square test of independence 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the nature of the data and the design of the experiment.  The experiment is double-blind and randomized,  and volunteers are paired so that one side of their face gets the old formula and the other side gets the new formula.  The response variable is the difference in the number of pimples between the two formulas.

Next,  I need to consider the type of test that is appropriate for this design.  A two-proportion z-test is used for comparing two independent proportions,  which does not apply here since the data is paired.  A two-sample t-test is used for comparing two independent groups,  which also does not apply here due to the paired design.  A chi-square test of independence is used for categorical data to determine if two variables are independent,  which does not apply to this situation.

Therefore,  the correct significance test to perform is a matched pairs t-test,  as it is designed to analyze the differences between paired observations.  The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A pharmaceutical company wants to test a new cholesterol-reducing drug against the previous drug.  It does not anticipate much association between cholesterol level and gender,  but it does anticipate an association between cholesterol level and the amount of exercise a person gets.  For a randomized block design,  it should: Choices: a) Block on gender because it is not associated with cholesterol level.  b) Block on gender because males and females are different.  c) Block on the type of drug because it may be associated with cholesterol level.  d) Block on exercise level because it is associated with cholesterol level.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the purpose of a randomized block design.  It is used to control for a nuisance variable that may affect the outcome of the study.
 Next,  I need to consider the anticipated associations mentioned.  The company does not anticipate an association between gender and cholesterol level,  but it does anticipate an association between cholesterol level and exercise level.
 Finally,  I need to choose the variable that should be used for blocking.  Since exercise level is associated with cholesterol level and gender is not,  the company should block on exercise level.

"Input: An experiment is to be conducted to determine whether taking fish oil capsules or garlic capsules has more of an effect on cholesterol levels.  In past studies it was noted that daily exercise intensity (low,  moderate,  high) is associated with cholesterol level,  but average sleep length (< 5,  5  - 8,  > 8  hours) is not associated with cholesterol level.  This experiment should be done Choices: a) by blocking on exercise intensity b) by blocking on sleep length c) by blocking on cholesterol level d) by blocking on capsule type 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the factors that are associated with cholesterol level in past studies.  The study mentions that daily exercise intensity is associated with cholesterol level,  but average sleep length is not.
 Next,  I need to determine which factor can be controlled and used to block the experiment.  Since exercise intensity is associated with cholesterol level,  it makes sense to use it as a blocking factor.

"Input: A test for heartworm in dogs shows a positive result in 96 % of dogs that actually have heartworm,  and shows a negative result in 98 % of dogs with no heartworm.  If heartworm actually occurs in 10 % of dogs,  what is the probability that a randomly selected dog that tested positive for heartworm actually has heartworm?  Choices: a) 11 % b) 18 % c) 84 % d) 88 % 
 Output:
 First,  let's define the probabilities given in the problem.  The probability of a dog having heartworm is 10 %,  and the probability of a dog not having heartworm is 90 %.
 The test shows a positive result in 96 % of dogs that actually have heartworm,  and a negative result in 98 % of dogs with no heartworm.
 We want to find the probability that a dog that tested positive for heartworm actually has heartworm,  which is the probability of having heartworm given a positive test result.
 To find this,  we can use Bayes' theorem,  which states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B),  where A is the event of having heartworm,  B is the event of a positive test result,  and P(A|B) is the probability of A given B.
 In this case,  P(A) is the probability of having heartworm,  which is 10 %.
 P(B|A) is the probability of a positive test result given that the dog has heartworm,  which is 96 %.
 P(B) is the probability of a positive test result,  which can be found by adding the probability of a positive test result given that the dog has heartworm and the probability of a positive test result given that the dog does not have heartworm.
 P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A),  where ¬A is the event of not having heartworm.
 P(B|¬A) is the probability of a positive test result given that the dog does not have heartworm,  which is 2 % (100 % - 98 %).
 P(¬A) is the probability of not having heartworm,  which is 90 %.
 So,  P(B) = 0.96 * 0.10 + 0.02 * 0.90 = 0.106.
 Now,  we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):
 P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.96 * 0.10 / 0.106 ≈ 0.88.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Suppose X and Y are random variables with μx = 32,  σx = 5,  μy = 44,  and σy = 12.  Given that X and Y are independent,  what are the mean and standard deviation of the random variable X + Y?  Choices: a) μx+y = 76,  σx+y = 8.5  b) μx+y = 76,  σx+y = 13  c) μx+y = 76,  σx+y = 17  d) μx+y = 38,  σx+y = 17  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the mean of the random variable X + Y.  Since X and Y are independent,  the mean of their sum is the sum of their means: μx+y = μx + μy = 32 + 44 = 76.
 Next,  I need to find the standard deviation of the random variable X + Y.  Since X and Y are independent,  the variance of their sum is the sum of their variances: σx+y² = σx² + To find the mean of the random variable X + Y, I add the means of X and Y: μx+y = μx + μy = 32 + 44 = 76.

Next, to find the standard deviation of the random variable X + Y, I add the variances of X and Y, since X and Y are independent: σx+y² = σx² + σy² = 5² + 12² = 25 + 144 = 169.

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance: σx+y = √169 = 13.

"Input: A high school sent a survey to a randomly selected sample of 75  of last year's graduating class.  27  of those selected did not return the survey.  The best plan of action would be to: Choices: a) Use the surveys that were returned and change the sample size to 48  for the analysis.  b) Use the surveys that were returned and leave the sample size at 75  for the analysis.  c) Randomly select 27  additional class members and send the survey to them.  d) Follow up with those that did not return the survey to encourage them to respond.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the best way to handle the non-returned surveys.  Option a) suggests using the returned surveys and changing the sample size,  which could introduce bias.
 Option b) suggests using the returned surveys and keeping the sample size the same,  which could also introduce bias since the sample is not representative of the entire graduating class.
 Option c) suggests randomly selecting additional class members to send the survey to,  which could help maintain the representativeness of the sample.
 Option d) suggests following up with non-respondents,  which could help increase the response rate but may not necessarily improve the representativeness of the sample.

"Input: Mr.  Bee's statistics class had a standard deviation of 11.2  on a standardized test,  while Mr.  Em's class had a standard deviation of 5.6  on the same test.  Which of the following is the most reasonable conclusion concerning the two classes' performance on the test?  Choices: a) Mr.  Bee's class is less heterogeneous than Mr.  Em's.  b) Mr.  Em's class is more homogeneous than Mr.  Bee's.  c) Mr.  Bee's class performed twice as well as Mr.  Em's.  d) Mr.  Em's class did not do as well as Mr.  Bee's.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the meaning of standard deviation.  Standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values.  A lower standard deviation indicates that the values are closer to the mean,  while a higher standard deviation indicates that the values are more spread out.
 Next,  I compare the standard deviations of the two classes.  Mr.  Bee's class has a standard deviation of 11.2,  while Mr.  Em's class has a standard deviation of 5.6.
 Finally,  I consider the given choices.  Choice a) states that Mr.  Bee's class is less heterogeneous than Mr.  Em's, which means that Mr.  Bee's class has less variation in performance. Since Mr.  Bee's class has a higher standard deviation, this statement is not reasonable. Choice b) states that Mr.  Em's class is more homogeneous than Mr.  Bee's, which means that Mr.  Em's class has less variation in performance. This statement is reasonable, as Mr.  Em's class has a lower standard deviation. Choice c) states that Mr.  Bee's class performed twice as well as Mr.  Em's, which is not related to the standard deviation and cannot be concluded from the given information. Choice d) states that Mr.  Em's class did not do as well as Mr.  Bee's, which is not necessarily true, as the standard deviation only measures the variation in performance and not the overall performance.

"Input: When a patient complains to the doctor about a certain set of symptoms,  the doctor diagnoses the patient with Condition A 15 % of the time.  If a patient with these symptoms is diagnosed with Condition A,  he or she is diagnosed with Condition B 70 % of the time.  A patient with these symptoms that is not diagnosed with Condition A is diagnosed with Condition B 10 % of the time.  What is the probability that a patient with this set of symptoms will be diagnosed with at least one of these conditions?  Choices: a) 0.235  b) 0.25  c) 0.765  d) 0.85  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the probability of being diagnosed with Condition A.  This is given as 15 %,  or 0.15.
 Next,  I need to calculate the probability of being diagnosed with Condition B given that the patient has Condition A.  This is given as 70 %,  or 0.7.
 Then,  I need to calculate the probability of being diagnosed with Condition B given that the patient does not have Condition A.  This is given as 10 %,  or 0.1.
 To find the probability of being diagnosed with at least one of these conditions,  I need to consider two scenarios: being diagnosed with Condition A and being diagnosed with Condition B.
 The probability of being diagnosed with Condition A is 0.15.
 The probability of being diagnosed with Condition B given that the patient has Condition A is 0.7,  so the probability of being diagnosed with both Conditions A and B is 0.15 * 0.7 = 0.0The probability of being diagnosed with at least one of these conditions is the sum of the probabilities of being diagnosed with Condition A and being diagnosed with Condition B.
 The probability of being diagnosed with Condition A is 0.15.
 The probability of being diagnosed with Condition B given that the patient does not have Condition A is 0.1, so the probability of being diagnosed with Condition B but not Condition A is 0.9 * 0.1 = 0.09.
 The total probability of being diagnosed with at least one of these conditions is 0.15 + 0.09 = 0.24.

 Now,  I need to consider the choices given.  Choice a) refers to the method of selection,  which is part of the definition of a simple random sample.  Choice b) refers to examination of the outcome,  which is not part of the definition.  Choice c) combines both a) and b),  so it is not correct because b) is not part of the definition.

"Input: In one study on the effect that eating meat products has on weight level,  an SRS of 500  subjects who admitted to eating meat at least once a day had their weights compared with those of an independent SRS of 500  people who claimed to be vegetarians.  In a second study,  an SRS of 500  subjects were served at least one meat meal per day for 6  months,  while an independent SRS of 500  others were chosen to receive a strictly vegetarian diet for 6  months,  with weights compared after 6  months.  Choices: a) The first study is a controlled experiment,  while the second is an observational study.  b) The first study is an observational study,  while the second is a controlled experiment.  c) Both studies are controlled experiments.  d) Both studies are observational studies.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the nature of each study.  In the first study,  subjects are compared based on their self-reported eating habits,  with no manipulation of the variables by the researchers.  This means the first study is an observational study.
 In the second study,  the researchers actively manipulate the diet of the subjects,  with one group receiving a strictly vegetarian diet and the other group receiving a diet with meat.  This manipulation of variables is a key characteristic of a controlled experiment.

"Input: Which of these is a correct description of the term?  Choices: a) A factor is a response variable.  b) Replication means the experiment should be repeated several times.  c) Levels are the same as treatments.  d) Experimental units are the same as subjects.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the terms involved.  A factor is a variable that is manipulated or allowed to vary in an experiment.  A response variable is also known as a dependent variable,  which is the variable being measured in an experiment.  Replication means conducting the experiment multiple times under the same conditions to reduce variability.  Levels refer to the different values a factor can take.  Treatments are the specific values or combinations of factors assigned to experimental units.  Experimental units are the objects to which treatments are applied.  Subjects are the participants in an experiment.

Now,  I will evaluate each choice based on this understanding.
a) A factor is a response variable.  This is incorrect because a factor is a variable that is manipulated, while a response variable is the variable being measured.
b) Replication means the experiment should be repeated several times.  This is correct because replication involves repeating the experiment to reduce variability.
c) Levels are the same as treatments.  This is incorrect because levels are the different values a factor can take, while treatments are the specific values or combinations of factors assigned to experimental units.
d) Experimental units are the same as subjects.  This is incorrect because experimental units are the objects to which treatments are applied, while subjects are the participants in an experiment.

"Input: In the jury pool available for this week,  30  percent of potential jurors are women.  A particular trial requires that,  out of a jury of 12,  at least three are women.  If a jury of 12  is to be selected at random from the pool,  what is the probability it meets the requirements of this trial?  Choices: a) 0.168  b) 0.843  c) 0.915  d) The answer cannot be determined without knowing the size of the jury pool.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the probability of selecting a jury with exactly 3 women and 9 men.  The probability of selecting 3 women out of 30% is (0.3)^3,  and the probability of selecting 9 men out of 70% is (0.7)^9.  The total number of ways to choose 3 women out of 12 is C(12,3),  which is 12! / (3! * 9!).  So,  the probability of selecting exactly 3 women and 9 men is (0.3)^3 * (0.7)^9 * C(12,3).
 Next,  I need to calculate the probability of selecting a jury with more than 3 women.  This can be done by calculating the probability of selecting 4, 5, 6, ..., 12 women and summing them up.  For each case,  I can use the binomial probability formula: P(X=k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n is the total number of trials,  k is the number of successes,  and p is the probability of success.  So,  the probability of selecting more than 3 women is the sum of P(X=4) + P(X=5) + ... + P(X=12).
 To find the probability of selecting a jury that meets the requirements,  I add the probability of selecting exactly 3 women and the probability of selecting more than 3 women.

"Input: An employment placement agency specializes in placing workers in jobs suited for them.  From past experience,  the agency knows that 20 % of all the workers it places will no longer be at the position in which they were placed after one year; however,  only 5 % of those remaining after the first year leave during the next year.  At the start of a year an employer hires 100  workers using this agency,  then at the start of the next year the employer hires 100  more.  How many of these 200  workers are expected to be on the job at the end of the second year?  Choices: a) 140  b) 144  c) 152  d) 156  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate how many workers are expected to be on the job at the end of the first year.  From the input,  20 % of the workers will leave after one year,  so 80 % will remain.  For the first 100  workers hired,  80 % of them will remain,  which is 100  * 0.8  = 80  workers.
 Next,  I need to calculate how many of these remaining workers are expected to be on the job at the end of the second year.  From the input,  5 % of those remaining after the first year will leave during the next year,  so 95 % will remain.  For the 80  workers remaining after the first year,  95 % of them will remain,  which is 80  * 0.95  = 76  workers.
 Now,  I need to consider the second set of 100  workers hired at the start of the next year.  Since they have not been on the job for a year,  we do not need to apply the 5 % rate to them.  So,  all 100  of them are expected to be on the job at the end of the second year.
 To find the total number of workers expected to be on the job at the end of the second year,  I add the number of workers from the first and second groups: 76  + 100  = 176  workers.
 However,  the choices provided do not include 176,  so there may be a mistake in the input or the choices.  Assuming the input is correct,  the closest choice is d) 156.

Choices: a) The number of heads in three tosses of a coin b) The number of rainy days in a given week c) The number of girls in a family of five children d) The number of students present in a class of 22  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider what makes a binomial model appropriate.  A binomial model is appropriate when there are a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials,  each with the same probability of success.
 a) The number of heads in three tosses of a coin - This is appropriate because there are three independent trials (tosses),  each with a success probability of 0.5 (getting a head).
 b) The number of rainy days in a given week - This is not appropriate because the trials (days) are not independent.  If it rains on one day,  it may affect the probability of rain on the next day.
 c) The number of girls in a family of five children - This is appropriate because there are five independent trials (children),  each with a success probability of 0.5 (having a girl).
 d) The number of students present in a class of 22 - This is not appropriate because the trials are not independent.  If a student is present,  it may affect the probability of other students being present.

 First,  we need to calculate the z-scores for both companies' fuses lasting at least 1  hour.  For Company I,  the z-score is (60 - 50) / 10 = 1.
 For Company II,  the z-score is (60 - 55) / 5 = 1.
 Next,  we look up the z-scores in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator to find the probabilities.  For both companies,  the probability that a fuse will last at least 1  hour is 0.841.

A 90 % confidence interval estimate for the difference in proportions between Toyota and Subaru car owners who are satisfied with their drive systems is reported to be -0.197  ± 0.081.  Which is a proper conclusion?  Choices: a) The interval is invalid because probabilities cannot be negative.  b) The interval is invalid because it does not contain zero.  c) Subaru owners are approximately 19.7 % more satisfied with their drive systems than are Toyota owners.  d) We are 90 % confident that the difference in proportions between Toyota and Subaru car owners who are satisfied with their drive systems is between -0.278  and -0.116.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the proportions of satisfied Toyota and Subaru owners.  The proportion of satisfied Toyota owners is 83  / 112  = 0.741.
 The proportion of satisfied Subaru owners is 76  / 81  = 0.938.
 The difference in proportions is 0.938  - 0.741  = 0.197.
 The confidence interval is given as -0.197  ± 0.081,  which means the interval is from -0.197  - 0.081  = -0.278  to -0.197  + 0.081  = -0.116.
 The confidence interval does not contain zero,  which means there is a statistically significant difference between the proportions.
 The interval being from -0.278  to -0.116  indicates that Toyota owners are less satisfied than Subaru owners,  not the other way around.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following statements about the correlation coefficient is true?  Choices: a) The correlation coefficient and the slope of the regression line may have opposite signs.  b) A correlation of 1  indicates a perfect cause-and-effect relationship between the variables.  c) Correlations of +0.87  and -0.87  indicate the same degree of clustering around the regression line.  d) Correlation applies equally well to quantitative and categorical data.  
 Output:
 First,  I will analyze each statement.
 a) The correlation coefficient and the slope of the regression line may have opposite signs.  This statement is true.  The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables,  while the slope of the regression line indicates the direction of the relationship.  If the relationship is negative,  both the correlation coefficient and the slope will be negative.  If the relationship is positive,  both will be positive.  However,  the magnitude of the correlation coefficient is not the same as the slope.
 b) A correlation of 1  indicates a perfect cause-and-effect relationship between the variables.  This statement is false.  A correlation of 1  indicates a perfect linear relationship between the variables,  not necessarily a cause-and-effect relationship.  There may be other factors at play.
 c) Correlations of +0.87  and -0.87  indicate the same degree of clustering around the regression line.  This statement is true.  The correlation coefficient measures the strength of the linear relationship,  regardless of the direction.  A correlation of +0.87  and -0.87  indicate a strong positive and negative relationship,  respectively,  with the same degree of clustering around the regression line.
 d) Correlation applies equally well to quantitative and categorical data.  This statement is false.  Correlation is primarily used to measure the strength of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables.  It does not apply well to categorical data.

"Input: A school board of a large school district is proposing a new dress code for students.  Some students feel that this dress code unfairly targets female students.  To see if there is a difference between boys and girls in their opposition to the new dress code,  they conduct a poll of 60  randomly selected male and 70  randomly selected female high school students in the district.  They find that 66  females oppose the dress code and 50  males oppose the dress code.  Which of the following explains why a two-proportion z-test is not appropriate?  Choices: a) The sample sizes are different.  b) The sample sizes are too large.  c) The number of successes and the number of failures for the two groups are not all large enough.  d) The shapes of the population distributions are not known.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the conditions for using a two-proportion z-test.  The test assumes that the two groups are independent,  and that the number of successes and the number of failures for each group are all large enough.
 Next,  I look at the given data.  For the female students,  there are 66  successes (oppose the dress code) and 70  - 66  = 4  failures (do not oppose the dress code).  For the male students,  there are 50  successes and 60  - 50  = 10  failures.
 Now,  I need to check if the number of successes and the number of failures for each group are large enough.  For a two-proportion z-test,  it is typically required that both the number of successes and the number of failures for each group are greater than 10.  In this case,  the number of failures for the female students (4) is not large enough.

"Input: A soft drink dispenser can be adjusted to deliver any fixed number of ounces.  If the machine is operating with a standard deviation in delivery equal to 0.3  ounce,  what should be the mean setting so that a 12 -ounce cup will overflow less than 1 % of the time?  Assume a normal distribution for ounces delivered.  Choices: a) 12  - 0.99 (0.3 ) ounces b) 12  - 2.326 (0.3 ) ounces c) 12  - 2.576 (0.3 ) ounces d) 12  + 2.326 (0.3 ) ounces 
 Output:
 First,  we need to find the z-score that corresponds to a probability of 0.01 (since we want the cup to overflow less than 1 % of the time).  The z-score for 0.01 is 2.326.
 Next,  we need to find the mean setting that corresponds to this z-score.  The formula for the z-score is z = (x - μ) / σ, where x is the actual value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.
 Rearranging the formula to solve for μ, we get μ = x - zσ.
 In this case,  the actual value x is 12 ounces,  the standard deviation σ is 0.3 ounces,  and the z-score z is 2.326.
 Plugging in the values,  we get μ = 12 - 2.326(0.3) = 12 - 0.6978 ounces.
 Therefore,  the mean setting should be 12 - 0.6978 ounces,  which is closest to 12 - 0.99 (0.3) ounces.

"Input: The average number of calories in Yum-Yum Good candy bars is 210,  with a standard deviation of 10.  If the number of calories per candy bar is normally distributed,  what percent of candy bars contain more than 225  calories?  Choices: a) 66.80 % b) 47.70 % c) 43.30 % d) 6.68 % 
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the z-score for 225  calories.  The z-score formula is (X - μ) / σ,  where X is the value we're interested in (225  calories),  μ is the mean (210  calories),  and σ is the standard deviation (10  calories).
 So,  the z-score is (225 - 210) / 10 = 1.5.
 Next,  I need to find the area to the right of the z-score in the standard normal distribution table,  since we're looking for the percent of candy bars with more than 225  calories.
 The area to the right of z = 1.5 is approximately 0.0668,  or 6.68%.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The mean daily demand for bread at a popular bakery is 2,500  loaves,  with a standard deviation of 225  loaves.  Every morning the bakery bakes 3,000  loaves.  What is the probability that today it will run out of bread?  Assume that the mean daily demand for bread at this bakery is normally distributed.  Choices: a) 0.8333  b) 0.1667  c) 0.9869  d) 0.0132  
 Output:
 First, I need to calculate the z-score for the given mean daily demand and the amount of bread baked. The z-score formula is (X - μ) / σ, where X is the value we're interested in (3,000 loaves), μ is the mean daily demand (2,500 loaves), and σ is the standard deviation (225 loaves).

So, the z-score is (3,000 - 2,500) / 225 = 2,500 / 225 ≈ 11.11.

Next, I need to find the probability that the demand is greater than 3,000 loaves, which corresponds to the area to the right of the z-score in the standard normal distribution table. Since the z-score is positive, I will look up the area to the left of the z-score in the table and subtract it from 1 to find the area to the right.

Looking up the z-score of 11.11 in the standard normal distribution table, we find that the area to the left is approximately 0.99999.

Therefore, the probability that the bakery will run out of bread is 1 - 0.99999 = 0.00001, which is not among the given choices. However, considering the approximation in the z-score calculation, the closest answer is:

"Input: Two dice are rolled simultaneously.  If both dice show 6,  then the player wins $20 ; otherwise the player loses the game.  It costs $2.00  to play the game.  What is the expected gain or loss per game?  Choices: a) The player will gain about $0.55.  b) The player will gain about $1.44.  c) The player will lose about $0.55.  d) The player will lose about $1.44.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the probability of winning the game.  There are 6  sides on each die,  so the probability of rolling a 6  on one die is 1/6 .
 Since the dice are rolled simultaneously,  the probability of both dice showing 6  is (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36 .
 Next,  I need to calculate the expected gain or loss.  The player wins $20  with a probability of 1/36 , and loses $2.00  with a probability of 1 - 1/36 = 35/36 .
 The expected gain or loss is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing them up: (20 * 1/36) + (-2 * 35/36) = 20/36 - 70/36 = -50/36 ≈ -1.39.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Suppose you toss a fair die three times and it comes up an even number each time.  Which of the following is a true statement?  Choices: a) By the law of large numbers,  the next toss is more likely to be an odd number than another even number.  b) Based on the properties of conditional probability the next toss is more likely to be an even number given that three in a row have been even.  c) Dice actually do have memories,  and thus the number that comes up on the next toss will be influenced by the previous tosses.  d) The probability that the next toss will again be even is 0.5.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the possible outcomes of a single die roll.  A fair die has six faces,  numbered 1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  and 6.  Even numbers are 2,  4,  and 6,  so the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 0.5.
 Next,  I need to consider the situation of rolling three even numbers in a row.  Since each roll is independent,  the probability of rolling an even number on the next roll is still 0.5, regardless of the previous rolls.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the given choices.  a) The law of large numbers states that as the number of trials increases,  the average of the results approaches the expected value.  However,  it does not imply that the next toss will be more likely to be an odd number after three even numbers.  So,  a) is not true.
 b) Conditional probability considers the probability of an event given that another event has occurred.  In this case,  the probability of the next toss being even given that the previous three tosses were even is still 0.5,  since each roll is independent.  So,  b) is not true.
 c) Dice do not have memories,  and each roll is independent.  So,  c) is not true.
 d) The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 0.5,  and each roll is independent.  So,  the probability of rolling an even number on the next roll, given that the previous three rolls were even, is still 0.5.  So,  d) is true.

"Input: Taxicabs in a metropolitan area are driven an average of 75,000  miles per year with a standard deviation of 12,000  miles.  What is the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000  miles if it is known that it has been driven over 80,000  miles?  Assume a normal distribution of miles per year among cabs.  Choices: a) 0.06  b) 0.34  c) 0.66  d) 0.94  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the z-score for 100,000  miles and for 80,000  miles.  The z-score formula is (X - μ) / σ, where X is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.
 For 100,000  miles, the z-score is (100,000 - 75,000) / 12,000 = 2.08.
 For 80,000  miles, the z-score is (80,000 - 75,000) / 12,000 = 0.42.
 Next,  I need to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores using a standard normal distribution table or calculator.
 The probability for a z-score of 2.08 is approximately 0.981.
 The probability for a z-score of 0.42 is approximately 0.662.
 To find the probability that a cab has been driven less than 100,000  miles given that it has been driven over 80,000  miles, I need to subtract the probability of being driven 80,000  miles or less from the probability of being driven 100,The probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles if it is known that it has been driven over 80,000 miles is 0.981 - 0.662 = 0.319.

"Input: The registrar’s office at a university has noticed that a large number of students fail to report a change of address.  The registrar decides to take a random sample of 150  students from the current directory of students and determine the number of students with the correct addresses on record.  He then uses this information to construct a 95  percent confidence interval.  Which of the following statements must be true?  Choices: a) The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval constructed.  b) Ninety-five percent of students at this university have the correct address on record.  c) The true proportion of students at this university with the correct addresses on record is within the confidence interval 95  percent of the time.  d) The sample proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a confidence interval is.  A confidence interval is a range of values,  calculated from a random sample,  that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence.  In this case,  the population parameter is the true proportion of students with the correct address on record.
 Now,  I need to evaluate each statement based on this definition.
 a) This statement says that the true proportion of students with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval constructed.  This is not necessarily true,  because the confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true proportion,  not guaranteed to contain it.
 b) This statement says that ninety-five percent of students at this university have the correct address on record.  This is not true,  because the confidence interval is not a percentage of the population,  but a range of values that is likely to contain the {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A botanist is interested in testing H0 : μ = 3.5  cm versus Ha: μ > 3.5,  where μ = the mean petal length of one variety of flowers.  A random sample of 50  petals gives significant results at a 5  percent level of significance.  Which of the following statements about the confidence interval to estimate the mean petal length is true?  Choices: a) The specified mean length of 3.5  cm is within a 90  percent confidence interval.  b) The specified mean length of 3.5  cm is not within a 90  percent confidence interval.  c) The specified mean length of 3.5  cm is below the lower limit of a 90  percent confidence interval.  d) The specified mean length of 3.5  cm is below the lower limit of a 95  percent confidence interval.  
 Output:
 First,  we need to understand the hypothesis testing.  The botanist is testing H0 : μ = 3.5  cm versus Ha: μ > 3.5.  This means the null hypothesis is that the mean petal length is 3.5  cm,  and the alternative hypothesis is that the mean petal length is greater than 3.5  cm.
 The random sample of 50  petals gives significant results at a 5  percent level of significance.  This means that the p-value is less than 0.05,  and we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.
 Now,  we need to consider the confidence interval.  Since we rejected the null hypothesis,  the mean petal length is not equal to 3.5  cm.  Therefore,  the specified mean length of 3.5  cm is not within the confidence interval.

"Input: A dentist has noticed that about two children in every seven whom he sees professionally develop cavities before they turn 10  years old.  Last week he examined the teeth of five unrelated children younger than 10.  Let X be the number of children who develop cavities before turning 10.  Which of the following gives the probability that at least one will develop a cavity before turning 10?  Choices: a) P(X = 2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7 ) b) P(X = 2  out of 7 ) c) P(X = 1 ) d) 1  – P(X = 0 ) 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the probability of a child developing cavities before turning 10.  The given information states that about two children in every seven develop cavities before turning 10,  so the probability of a child developing cavities is 2/7.
 Next,  I need to find the probability that at least one child out of five develops cavities before turning 10.  This is the opposite of the probability that none of the children develop cavities.
 To find the probability that none of the children develop cavities,  I can use the complement rule: P(X = 0) = 1 - P(X ≠ 0).
 The probability of a child not developing cavities is 1 - 2/7 = 5/7.
 Since the children are examined independently,  I can multiply the probabilities for each child: P(X = 0) = (5/7)^5.
 Therefore,  the probability that at least one child develops cavities is 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - (5/7)^5.
 So,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Which of the following is NOT true of the χ2  probability distribution function?  Choices: a) The area under the χ2  curve is 1.  b) χ2  is defined only for nonnegative values of the variable.  c) For small degrees of freedom,  the curve displays strong right-skewness.  d) For the same α,  as the number of degrees of freedom increases,  the critical value for the rejection region decreases.  
 Output:
 First,  I will go through each choice and evaluate its truthfulness in relation to the χ2  probability distribution function.
 a) The area under the χ2  curve is 1: This is true.  The χ2  distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution, and the total area under any probability distribution curve is always 1.
 b) χ2  is defined only for nonnegative values of the variable: This is also true.  The χ2  distribution is defined only for nonnegative values, as it is based on the sum of squares of standard normal random variables, which are always nonnegative.
 c) For small degrees of freedom,  the curve displays strong right-skewness: This is true.  The χ2  distribution is skewed to the right for small degrees of freedom, and the skewness decreases as the degrees of freedom increase.
 d) For the same α,  as the number of degrees of freedom increases,  the critical value for the rejection region decreases: This is NOT true.  As the number of degrees of freedom increases,  the shape of the χ2  distribution becomes more symmetric and the critical values for the rejection region increase.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The relation between the selling price of a car (in $1,000 ) and its age (in years) is estimated from a random sample of cars of a specific model.  The relation is given by the following formula: Selling price = 15.9  – 0.983  (age) Which of the following can we conclude from this equation?  Choices: a) For every year the car gets older,  the selling price goes down by approximately 9.83  percent.  b) A new car costs on the average $9,830.  c) For every year the car gets older,  the selling price drops by approximately $1,590.  d) For every year the car gets older,  the selling price drops by approximately $983.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to analyze the given formula: Selling price = 15.9  – 0.983  (age).
 The formula shows that the selling price decreases as the car's age increases,  with a decrease of 0.983  for each additional year.
 To find the percentage decrease,  I can divide the decrease in selling price by the initial selling price and multiply by 100: (0.983  / 15.9) * 100 ≈ 6%.
 This means that for every year the car gets older,  the selling price goes down by approximately 6%,  not 9.83% as stated in option a).
 Now,  let's check the average cost of a new car by plugging in age = 0 into the formula: Selling price = 15.9  – 0.983  (0) = 15.9  $1,000.
 This means that a new car costs on the average $15,900,  not $9,830 as stated in option b).
 To find the decrease in selling price for each year,  I can multiply the decrease per year by 1,000: 0.983  * 1,000 = $983.
 This means that for every year the car gets older,  the selling price drops by approximately $983,  not $1,590 as stated in option c),  and not $983 as stated in option d).
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Consider a hypothesis test with H0  : μ = 70  and Ha : μ < 70.  Which of the following choices of significance level and sample size results in the greatest power of the test when μ = 65?  Choices: a) α = 0.05,  n = 15  b) α = 0.01,  n = 15  c) α = 0.05,  n = 30  d) α = 0.01,  n = 30  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the factors that affect the power of a test.  The power of a test is affected by the significance level (α),  the sample size (n),  and the true population mean (μ).  In this case,  we are comparing the power of the test under different combinations of α and n,  with a fixed true population mean of μ = 65.

Second,  I need to consider the trade-off between Type I and Type II errors.  A lower significance level (α) reduces the probability of a Type I error (false positive),  but it also makes the test more sensitive to differences from the null hypothesis,  which can increase the probability of a Type II error (false negative).  A larger sample size (n) increases the precision of the sample mean,  which can reduce both Type I and Type II errors.

Third,  I need to compare the choices based on these factors.  Choice a) has a higher α than choice b),  but the same sample size.  Choice c) has the same α as choice a),  but a larger sample size.  Choice d) has both a lower α and a larger sample size than the other choices.

Given these considerations,  choice d) has the lowest α and the largest sample size,  which means it has the best balance between minimizing Type I and Type II errors.  Therefore,  choice d) has the greatest power of the test.

"Input: A farmer who raises hens for egg production wants his eggs to have a mean mass of 56  grams.  He is considering the purchase of a different type of hen,  so he took a random sample of 18  eggs laid by this type of hen.  The distribution of the masses is symmetric and mound-shaped with a mean of 54.1  grams and no outliers.  The farmer conducted a t-test to see if there is evidence that the eggs from these hens have a mean mass that is different from 56  g and got a test statistic of t= -1.973.  If he uses a 5 % significance level,  which is the correct conclusion and reason?  Choices: a) Because tis more extreme than ±1.96,  he should reject the null hypothesis.  He has convincing evidence at the 5 % significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56  grams.  b) Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 17  degrees of freedom,  he should not reject the null hypothesis.  He does not have convincing evidence at the 5 % significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56  grams.  c) Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 18  degrees of freedom,  he should not reject the null hypothesis.  He does not have convincing evidence at the 5 % significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56  grams.  d) Because tis more extreme than the critical value of t for 18  degrees of freedom,  he should reject the null hypothesis.  He has convincing evidence at the 5 % significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56  grams.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the degrees of freedom for the t-test.  The degrees of freedom is equal to the sample size minus 1,  so in this case,  it is 18 - 1 = 17.
 Next,  I need to find the critical value of t for a two-tailed test with a 5 % significance level and 17 degrees of freedom.  Using a t-distribution table or calculator,  I find that the critical value is approximately ±2.110.
 Now,  I compare the test statistic to the critical value.  The test statistic is t= -1.973,  which is less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom.
 Therefore,  the correct conclusion is that because the test statistic is less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom,  he should not reject the null hypothesis.  He does not have convincing evidence at the 5 % significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56  grams.  So,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"

 Output:
 First,  we need to identify who the survey is aimed at.  The survey is conducted to assess the support for an increase in the gasoline tax to support the county school system.
 Next,  we need to consider who can be affected or have an opinion on the gasoline tax increase.  This would include all county residents,  as they would all pay the tax.

 Output:
 First,  I need to consider what makes a sample simple random.  A simple random sample is one where every possible sample of the same size has an equal chance of being selected.
 In this case,  the researcher is selecting every twenty-fifth student entering the school in the morning.  This means that the selection is based on a specific order of arrival,  not on randomly choosing students.

"Input: Which of the following is a true statement?  Choices: a) While properly designed experiments can strongly suggest cause-and-effect relationships,  a complete census is the only way of establishing such a relationship.  b) If properly designed,  observational studies can establish cause-and-effect relationships just as strongly as properly designed experiments.  c) Controlled experiments are often undertaken later to establish cause-and-effect relationships first suggested by observational studies.  d) A useful approach to overcome bias in observational studies is to increase the sample size.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the differences between observational studies and controlled experiments.  Observational studies observe subjects in their natural environment without any manipulation,  while controlled experiments deliberately manipulate one or more variables to observe their effects.
 Next,  I need to consider the strengths and limitations of each type of study.  Controlled experiments are more likely to establish cause-and-effect relationships because they control for confounding variables,  but they may not be feasible or ethical in some situations.  Observational studies can provide valuable insights,  but they are more prone to confounding variables and bias.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the choices given.  Choice a) suggests that a complete census is the only way to establish cause-and-effect relationships,  which is not true because controlled experiments can also establish such relationships.  Choice b) claims that observational studies can establish cause-and-effect relationships just as strongly as experiments,  which is not true because experiments are more likely to establish such relationships.  Choice c) states that controlled experiments are often undertaken later to establish cause-and-effect relationships first suggested by observational studies,  which is a true statement because observational studies can suggest hypotheses that can then be tested in controlled experiments.  Choice d) suggests that increasing the sample size can overcome bias in observational studies,  which is not always true because increasing the sample size may not eliminate bias if the sampling method is biased.

What is the probability this customer does not request tire replacements?  Choices: a) 0.42  b) 0.5  c) 0.7  d) 0.833  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the probability that a customer requests both oil changes and tire replacements.  Since 10  percent of customers request both,  the probability is 0.10.
 Next,  I need to find the probability that a customer requests an oil change but not tire replacements.  Since 60  percent of customers request an oil change,  and 10  percent of those also request tire replacements,  the probability of requesting only an oil change is 0.60 - 0.10 = 0.50.
 Now,  I need to find the probability that a customer does not request tire replacements.  Since 30  percent of customers request tire replacements,  the probability of not requesting tire replacements is 1 - 0.30 = 0.70.
 To find the probability that a customer requests an oil change and does not request tire replacements,  I multiply the probabilities: 0.50 * 0.70 = 0.35.

"Input: Which of the following statements is false?  Choices: a) Like the normal distribution,  the t-distributions are symmetric.  b) The t-distributions are lower at the mean and higher at the tails,  and so are more spread out than the normal distribution.  c) The greater the df,  the closer the t-distributions are to the normal distribution.  d) The smaller the df,  the better the 68 -95 -99.7  Rule works for t-models.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the characteristics of the t-distribution.  The t-distribution is symmetric,  like the normal distribution,  so statement a) is true.
 Next,  the t-distribution is lower at the mean and higher at the tails,  and so is more spread out than the normal distribution,  which makes statement b) true.
 The greater the degrees of freedom (df),  the closer the t-distribution is to the normal distribution,  so statement c) is true.
 The smaller the df,  the t-distribution becomes more spread out,  and so the 68-95-99.7 Rule (which applies to the normal distribution) may not work as well for t-models.  This means statement d) is false.

"Input: A kidney dialysis center periodically checks a sample of its equipment and performs a major recalibration if readings are sufficiently off target.  Similarly,  a fabric factory periodically checks the sizes of towels coming off an assembly line and halts production if measurements are sufficiently off target.  In both situations,  we have the null hypothesis that the equipment is performing satisfactorily.  For each situation,  which is the more serious concern,  a Type I or Type II error?  Choices: a) Dialysis center: Type I error,  towel manufacturer: Type I error b) Dialysis center: Type I error,  towel manufacturer: Type II error c) Dialysis center: Type II error,  towel manufacturer: Type I error d) Dialysis center: Type II error,  towel manufacturer: Type II error 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the consequences of each type of error in each situation.
 In the dialysis center,  a Type I error would mean incorrectly concluding that the equipment is not performing satisfactorily,  which could lead to unnecessary recalibrations and potential harm to patients.
 In the towel manufacturer,  a Type I error would mean incorrectly concluding that the towels are not meeting size requirements,  which could lead to unnecessary halting of production and potential loss of revenue.
 Now,  I need to consider which error is more serious in each situation.
 In the dialysis center,  a Type I error is more serious because it could potentially harm patients.
 In the towel manufacturer,  a Type I error is more serious because it could lead to unnecessary halting of production and potential loss of revenue.

"Input: A company with offices in five different countries is interested in estimating the proportion of its employees in favor of banning smoking on the office premises.  It is known that the views of people from different countries on issues like smoking tend to vary due to the influence of different local social structures.  Which of the following is an appropriate sampling technique to use in this situation,  and why?  Choices: a) Stratified sample,  because the population is divided into five strata—namely,  five offices in five different countries b) Cluster sample,  because the population is divided into five clusters—namely,  five offices in five different countries c) Simple random sample,  because this is the simplest sampling method d) Simple random sample,  because this is the only method that gives unbiased results 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the nature of the population and the goal of the study.  The goal is to estimate the proportion of employees in favor of banning smoking on the office premises,  and the population consists of employees from five different countries.
 Next,  I need to evaluate the suitability of each sampling technique based on the characteristics of the population.  A stratified sample is appropriate when the population is divided into distinct groups or strata,  and each group has a unique characteristic that affects the outcome of interest.  In this case,  the employees from different countries have different views on smoking,  so dividing the population into five strata based on the country of work is appropriate.
 A cluster sample is suitable when the population is spread out geographically,  and it is not feasible to sample every individual.  However,  the question does not mention that the employees are spread out geographically.
 A simple random sample is the simplest sampling method,  but it may not be appropriate when the population has distinct subgroups with different characteristics.  In this case,  using a simple random sample may not capture the variation in views among employees from different countries.
 Therefore,  the appropriate sampling technique is a) {'sol': 'a'}"

 First,  I need to calculate the probability of Semir cooking himself a big breakfast.  There is a 2/6 chance he will roll a 1 or 2,  so the probability is 2/6 = 1/3.
 Next,  I need to calculate the probability of Semir having a lighter breakfast.  There is a 4/6 chance he will roll a 3 or larger,  so the probability is 4/6 = 2/3.
 Now,  I need to calculate the probability of Semir being on time for school if he cooks himself a big breakfast.  There is a 100% - 15% = 85% chance he will be on time.
 Then,  I need to calculate the probability of Semir being on time for school if he has a lighter breakfast.  There is a 100% - 6% = 94% chance he will be on time.
 To find the overall probability of Semir being on time for school,  I need to consider both scenarios.  If he cooks himself a big breakfast,  the probability is (1/3) * 0.85 = 0.2833.  If he has a lighter breakfast,  the probability is (2/3) * 0.94 = 0.6267.
 The total probability of Semir being on time for school is 0.2833 + 0.6267 = 0.91.

"Input: A teacher's union and a school district are negotiating salaries for the coming year.  The teachers want more money,  and the district,  claiming,  as always,  budget constraints,  wants to pay as little as possible.  The district,  like most,  has a large number of moderately paid teachers and a few highly paid administrators.  The salaries of all teachers and administrators are included in trying to figure out,  on average,  how much the professional staff currently earn.  Which of the following would the teachers' union be most likely to quote during negotiations?  Choices: a) The mean of all the salaries.  b) The mode of all the salaries.  c) The standard deviation of all the salaries.  d) The median of all the salaries.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider what each measure of central tendency represents and how it might be used to argue for higher salaries.
 The mean is the sum of all salaries divided by the number of salaries,  and it is affected by outliers.
 The mode is the most frequent salary,  which might not be representative of the majority of salaries.
 The standard deviation measures the spread of the salaries,  but it doesn't directly indicate the average salary.
 The median is the middle value when salaries are arranged in order,  and it is less affected by outliers.

 The teachers' union would likely want to emphasize the average salary that represents the majority of teachers,  as this would be a more fair comparison to their salaries. The median is less influenced by the high salaries of administrators and better represents the typical teacher's salary.

 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The Hardcore Construction Company has two offices,  one in Atlanta and one in New Orleans.  Fifteen engineers work in the Atlanta office,  and 14  engineers work in the New Orleans office.  The business manager decided to use a 2 -sample t-test to compare the mean salaries of engineers in the two offices.  Because there were only 15  engineers in one office and 14  engineers in the other,  he used the salaries of all the engineers in the computation.  Is the 2 -sample t-test an appropriate inferential technique in this situation?  Choices: a) Yes,  because he is comparing the means of two small groups.  b) Yes.  Both Atlanta and New Orleans are large cities,  so the salaries are comparable.  c) Yes.  Because Atlanta and New Orleans are about 500  miles apart,  the two groups of engineers can be assumed to be independent.  d) No,  because the entire population information was used from both offices.  Because no samples were taken,  a t-test should not be used.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the sample size for each office.  The Atlanta office has 15  engineers,  and the New Orleans office has 14  engineers.  A 2 -sample t-test typically requires at least 30  observations in each group for the Central Limit Theorem to apply,  so this condition is not met.
 Next,  I need to consider whether the two groups are independent.  The fact that Atlanta and New Orleans are about 500  miles apart does not necessarily mean the groups are independent.  Independence is determined by the random selection of the sample,  not the physical distance between the offices.
 Finally,  I need to consider whether the entire population information was used.  In this case,  the business manager used the salaries of all the engineers in both offices,  so no samples were taken.  This means that the t-test,  which is designed for sample data,  should not be used.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: For the regression line,  which of the following statements about residuals is true?  Choices: a) Influential scores have large residuals.  b) If the linear model is good,  the number of positive residuals will be the same as the number of negative residuals.  c) The mean of the residuals is always zero.  d) If the correlation is 0,  there will be a distinct pattern in the residual plot.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what residuals are in the context of regression lines.  Residuals are the differences between the observed values and the predicted values.
 Next,  I will analyze each statement to determine which is true.
 a) Influential scores have large residuals.  This statement is true because influential scores can have a significant impact on the regression line,  leading to larger residuals.
 b) If the linear model is good,  the number of positive residuals will be the same as the number of negative residuals.  This statement is not necessarily true because a good linear model does not guarantee an equal number of positive and negative residuals.
 c) The mean of the residuals is always zero.  This statement is true because the residuals are calculated as the observed values minus the predicted values,  so the mean of the residuals is always zero.
 d) If the correlation is 0,  there will be a distinct pattern in the residual plot.  This statement is not necessarily true because a correlation of 0 means there is no linear relationship between the variables,  but it does not guarantee a distinct pattern in the residual plot.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A reading specialist in a large public school system believes that the more time students spend reading,  the better they will do in school.  She plans a middle school experiment in which an SRS of 30  eighth graders will be assigned four extra hours of reading per week,  an SRS of 30  seventh graders will be assigned two extra hours of reading per week,  and an SRS of 30  sixth graders with no extra assigned reading will be a control group.  After one school year,  the mean GPAs from each group will be compared.  Is this a good experimental design?  Choices: a) Yes.  b) No,  because while this design may point out an association between reading and GPA,  it cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship.  c) No,  because without blinding,  there is a strong chance of a placebo effect.  d) No,  because grade level is a lurking variable which may well be confounded with the variables under consideration.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the purpose of the experiment and whether it is designed to answer the question it is trying to address.  The goal is to determine if there is a cause-and-effect relationship between reading and GPA.
 Next,  I need to consider whether the design controls for any potential confounding variables.  In this case,  grade level could be a confounding variable,  as students in different grades may have different levels of academic preparedness or motivation.
 Finally,  I need to consider whether the design is able to establish causation.  While the design may show an association between reading and GPA,  it cannot establish causation without controlling for other variables.

"Input: What is a sampling distribution?  Choices: a) A distribution of all the statistics that can be found in a given sample b) A histogram,  or other such visual representation,  showing the distribution of a sample c) A normal distribution of some statistic d) A distribution of all the values taken by a statistic from all possible samples of a given size 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a sampling distribution is.  A sampling distribution is a distribution of a statistic that is obtained by selecting all possible samples of a given size from a population.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  a) A distribution of all the statistics that can be found in a given sample is not correct because it refers to all statistics, not just a specific one.  b) A histogram, or other such visual representation, showing the distribution of a sample is not correct because it refers to a single sample, not all possible samples.  c) A normal distribution of some statistic is not correct because it is a specific type of distribution, not the general definition of a sampling distribution.

"Input: A farmer wants to know whether a new fertilizer has increased the mean weight of his apples.  With the old fertilizer,  the mean weight was 4.0  ounces per apple.  The farmer decides to test H0 : μ = 4.0  ounces versus Ha : μ > 4.0  ounces,  at a 5  percent level of significance,  where μ = the mean weight of apples using the new fertilizer.  The weights of apples are approximately normally distributed.  The farmer takes a random sample of 16  apples and computes a mean of 4.3  ounces and a standard deviation of 0.6  ounces.  Which of the following gives the p-value for this test?  Choices: a) P(Z > 2 ) b) P(Z < 2 ) c) P(t > 2 ) with 15  degrees of freedom d) P(t < 2 ) with 15  degrees of freedom 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the test statistic.  Since the sample size is 16,  the central limit theorem tells us that the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normally distributed.  The test statistic for a one-sample t-test is given by t = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n),  where x̄ is the sample mean,  μ is the population mean,  s is the sample standard deviation,  and n is the sample size.

In this case,  x̄ = 4.3,  μ = 4.0,  s = 0.6,  and n = 16.  Plugging these values into the formula,  I get t = (4.3 - 4.0) / (0.6 / √16) = 0.3 / (0.6 / 4) = 0.3 / 0.15 = 2.

Now,  I need to find the p-value.  Since the alternative hypothesis is Ha : μ > 4.0,  this is a one-tailed test with the rejection region in the right tail.  The test statistic is t = 2,  and the degrees of freedom are n - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15.

The correct p-value is the probability of observing a t-value greater than 2,  given 15 degrees of freedom.  So the p-value is P(t > 2) with 15 degrees of freedom.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: In a study on the effect of music on worker productivity,  employees were told that a different genre of background music would be played each day and the corresponding production outputs noted.  Every change in music resulted in an increase in production.  This is an example of Choices: a) the effect of a treatment unit.  b) the placebo effect.  c) the control group effect.  d) sampling error.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the context of the study.  The study is examining the effect of different genres of music on worker productivity.
 Next,  I need to consider the experimental design.  Employees are told that a different genre of music will be played each day,  but the music itself is the same.
 The fact that every change in music resulted in an increase in production is likely due to the employees' belief that the music is responsible for the change,  even though it is not.

"Input: In a clinical trial,  30  sickle cell anemia patients are randomly assigned to two groups.  One group receives the currently marketed medicine,  and the other group receives an experimental medicine.  Each week,  patients report to the clinic where blood tests are conducted.  The lab technician is unaware of the kind of medicine the patient is taking.  This design can be described as Choices: a) a completely randomized design,  with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two treatments b) a matched-pairs design,  with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine forming a pair c) a randomized block design,  with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two blocks d) a randomized block design,  with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two treatments 
 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the type of experimental design.  In this case,  patients are randomly assigned to two groups,  one receiving the currently marketed medicine and the other receiving the experimental medicine.
 Next,  I need to consider the structure of the design.  Since patients are randomly assigned to groups without any matching criteria, it is not a matched-pairs design.
 The design is also not a randomized block design,  as there are no blocks defined based on patient characteristics.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is a completely randomized design,  with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two treatments.  This corresponds to option a) a completely randomized design,  with the currently marketed medicine and the experimental medicine as two treatments.

Choices: a) μ = 14,900 ; σ = 6100  b) μ = 15,100 ; σ = 6200  c) μ = 15,300 ; σ = 6300  d) μ = 15,500 ; σ = 6400  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the mean and standard deviation for the weights of trucks.  Since 70 % of the trucks weigh more than 12,000  pounds,  this means that 30 % weigh less than 12,000  pounds.  Similarly,  80 % of the trucks weigh more than 10,000  pounds,  which means that 20 % weigh less than 10,000  pounds.
 I can use the z-score formula to find the mean and standard deviation.  The z-score for 30 % is -0.52  (from the standard normal table),  and the z-score for 20 % is -0.84.
 Now,  I can set up two equations using the z-score formula:
 z = (x - μ) / σ
 For the 12,000  pounds weight:
 -0.52  = (12,000 - μ) / σ
 For the 10,000  pounds weight:

Which of the following schemes should he use to do the simulation?  Choices: a) Assign numbers 0,  1  to successfully selling a policy to a customer and numbers 2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9  to failing to sell a policy to a customer.  b) Assign numbers 0,  1  to successfully selling a policy to a customer and numbers 2,  3,  4  to failing to sell a policy to a customer.  c) Assign number 0  to successfully selling a policy to a customer and number 1  to failing to sell a policy to a customer.  d) Assign numbers 0,  1,  2,  3,  4  to successfully selling a policy to a customer and numbers 5,  6,  7,  8,  9  to failing to sell a policy to a customer.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the goal of the simulation.  The agent wants to estimate the mean number of customers he needs to contact before being able to sell a policy.  This means he needs to simulate the number of attempts it takes to get a success.
 Next,  I need to consider the probability of success.  The agent is successful in selling a policy to 20  percent of the customers he contacts,  which means the probability of success is 0.20.
 Now,  I need to choose a scheme that can represent the probability of success and failure.  The scheme should have a small number of outcomes that represent the probability of success and a larger number of outcomes that represent the probability of failure.
 Option a) has 10  possible outcomes,  with 2  outcomes representing success and 8  outcomes representing failure,  which matches the probability of success (0.20).
 Option b) has 9  possible outcomes,  with 2  outcomes representing success and 7  outcomes representing failure,  which does not match the probability of success.
 Option c) has 2  possible outcomes,  with 1  outcome representing success and 1  outcome representing failure,  which does not match the probability of success.
 Option d) has 10  possible outcomes,  with 5  outcomes representing success and 5  outcomes representing failure,  which does not match the probability of success.

"Input: The midterm scores for a statistics course were approximately normally distributed with a mean of 52  points and a standard deviation of 4  points.  The final exam scores were approximately normally distributed with a mean of 112  points and a standard deviation of 10  points.  One student had a score of 58  points on the midterm.  If she had the same standardized score (z-score) on the final exam,  what must her score have been?  Choices: a) 15  points b) 58  points c) 118  points d) 127  points 
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the z-score for the midterm score of 58  points.  The formula for the z-score is (X - μ) / σ,  where X is the score,  μ is the mean,  and σ is the standard deviation.
 For the midterm,  the z-score is (58 - 52) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5.
 Since the student had the same z-score on the final exam,  I can use the same z-score to find her final exam score.
 The formula for the final exam score is X = z * σ + μ.
 For the final exam,  the z-score is 1.5,  the standard deviation is 10,  and the mean is 112.
 Plugging these values into the formula,  I get X = 1.5 * 10 + 112 = 15 + 112 = 127  points.

"Input: The sampling distribution of the sample mean is close to the normal distribution Choices: a) only if both the original population has a normal distribution and n is large.  b) if the standard deviation of the original population is known.  c) if n is large,  no matter what the distribution of the original population.  d) no matter what the value of n or what the distribution of the original population.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the conditions under which the sampling distribution of the sample mean is close to the normal distribution.  The central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal under two conditions: 1) the original population has a normal distribution,  and 2) the sample size n is large.

Next,  I will evaluate the given choices:
a) only if both the original population has a normal distribution and n is large - This choice accurately describes the conditions required for the sampling distribution of the sample mean to be close to the normal distribution.
b) if the standard deviation of the original population is known - This choice is not relevant to the conditions for the sampling distribution to be close to the normal distribution.
c) if n is large,  no matter what the distribution of the original population - This choice is partially correct, but it does not account for the requirement that the original population must have a normal distribution.
d) no matter what the value of n or what the distribution of the original population - This choice is incorrect because the original population must have a normal distribution or the sample size n must be large.

"Input: Suppose H0 : p = 0.6,  and the power of the test for Ha: p = 0.7  is 0.8.  Which of the following is a valid conclusion?  Choices: a) The probability of committing a Type I error is 0.1.  b) If Ha is true,  the probability of failing to reject H0  is 0.2.  c) The probability of committing a Type II error is 0.3.  d) All of the above are valid conclusions.  
 Output:
 First,  let's understand the given information.  We have a null hypothesis H0: p = 0.6 and an alternative hypothesis Ha: p = 0.7.  The power of the test is 0.8,  which means the probability of correctly rejecting H0 when Ha is true is 0.8.

Now, let's analyze each choice:

a) The probability of committing a Type I error is 0.1.
A Type I error occurs when we reject H0 when it is actually true. The power of the test is given for Ha being true, not for H0 being true. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the probability of committing a Type I error is 0.1 based on the given information.

b) If Ha is true, the probability of failing to reject H0 is 0.2.
The power of the test is the probability of correctly rejecting H0 when Ha is true, which is given as 0.8. Therefore, the probability of failing to reject H0 when Ha is true is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2. This statement is valid.

c) The probability of committing a Type II error is 0.3.
A Type II error occurs when we fail to reject H0 when it is false (i.e., when Ha is true). The given power of the test is 0.8, which is the probability of correctly rejecting H0 when Ha is true. The probability of committing a Type II error is 1 - power of the test = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2, not 0.3. Therefore, this statement is not valid.

d) All of the above are valid conclusions.
Since choice c) is not a valid conclusion, this option is not correct.

 Output:
 First, I need to understand the relationship between the first quartile and the mean in a normal distribution. The first quartile represents the value below which 25% of the data falls. In a normal distribution, the first quartile is approximately 0.6745 standard deviations below the mean.

Next, I can set up an equation to solve for the standard deviation (σ). The first quartile (Q1) is $48,815, and the mean (μ) is $55,800. The relationship between the first quartile and the mean can be expressed as:

Q1 = μ - 0.6745 * σ

Plugging in the given values:

$48,815 = $55,800 - 0.6745 * σ

Now, I'll solve for σ:

0.6745 * σ = $55,800 - $48,815
0.6745 * σ = $6,985

σ = $6,985 / 0.6745

Which of the following is the highest amount of rainfall,  in inches,  this city could have this month for the month to be among the 10 percent driest months the city has seen?  Choices: a) 8.05  b) 7.6  c) 3.95  d) 3.37  
 Output:
 First,  we need to find the rainfall amount that corresponds to the 10th percentile of the distribution.  Since the distribution is normal,  we can use the z-score formula to find this value.
 The z-score for the 10th percentile can be found using a standard normal distribution table or calculator,  which gives us a z-score of approximately -1.28.
 Next,  we can use the z-score formula to find the corresponding rainfall amount: z = (x - μ) / σ, where x is the rainfall amount, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.
 Rearranging the formula to solve for x, we get x = μ + (z * σ).
 Plugging in the values, we have x = 6 + (-1.28 * 1.6) = 6 - 2.048 = 3.9512.
 The highest amount of rainfall for the month to be among the 10 percent driest months is approximately 3.95 inches.

"Input: Which of the following is most useful in establishing cause-and-effect relationships?  Choices: a) A complete census b) A least squares regression line showing high correlation c) A simple random sample (SRS) d) An experiment 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider what is most useful in establishing cause-and-effect relationships.  A complete census provides information about the entire population,  but it does not establish cause-and-effect relationships.  A least squares regression line showing high correlation indicates a strong relationship between two variables,  but it does not necessarily establish causation.  A simple random sample (SRS) is a method for selecting a representative sample from a population,  but it does not establish cause-and-effect relationships.  An experiment,  on the other hand,  involves manipulating one or more variables to observe the effect on another variable,  which allows for the establishment of cause-and-effect relationships.

 Output:
 First,  we need to consider the context of the question.  The question is about the officiating in a local basketball team's most recent loss.
 Next,  we need to consider the typical reaction of sports fans to such situations.  Sports fans usually feel that the officiating could have been better,  but they also believe that the team's performance is the primary factor in the loss.

"Input: Alfred and Ben don't know each other but are each considering asking the lovely Charlene to the school prom.  The probability that at least one of them will ask her is 0.72.  The probability that they both ask her is 0.18.  The probability that Alfred asks her is 0.6.  What is the probability that Ben asks Charlene to the prom?  Choices: a) 0.78  b) 0.3  c) 0.24  d) 0.48  
 Output:
 First, I need to find the probability that Ben does not ask Charlene. Let's denote the probability that Ben asks Charlene as P(Ben). The probability that they both ask her is 0.18, so the probability that both of them do not ask her is 1 - 0.18 = 0.82.

Next, I need to find the probability that at least one of them asks her but not both. This is the probability that Alfred asks her and Ben does not, or that Ben asks her and Alfred does not. The probability that Alfred asks her is 0.6, so the probability that Alfred asks her and Ben does not is 0.6 * (1 - P(Ben)). Similarly, the probability that Ben asks her and Alfred does not is P(Ben) * (1 - 0.6).

The probability that at least one of them asks her but not both is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.6 * (1 - P(Ben)) + P(Ben) * (1 - 0.6).

We know that the probability that at least one of them asks her is 0.72, so we can write the equation: 0.72 = 0.6 * (1 - P(Ben)) + P(Ben) * (1 - 0.6).

Now, I need to solve for P(Ben). First, I'll distribute the terms: 0.72 = 0.6 - 0.6 * P(Ben) + P(Ben) - 0.6 * P(Ben).

Combining like terms, I get: 0.72 = 0.6 - 0.4 * P(Ben).

Subtracting 0.6 from both sides, I get: 0.12 = -0.4 * P(Ben).

Dividing both sides by -0.4, I get: P(Ben) = 0.3.

Therefore, the probability that Ben asks Charlene to the prom is 0.3, which corresponds to option b) 0.3.

 First,  I need to understand what margin of error means in the context of a survey.  The margin of error is a measure of how much the sample results may differ from the true population results.
 Next,  I need to consider the given choices and determine which one best describes the margin of error of 3 %.
 a) This choice suggests that 3 % of those surveyed refused to participate, which is not what margin of error means.
 b) This choice suggests that 3 % of the population might start or stop using coupons, which is not related to the margin of error.
 c) This choice calculates the range of households that responded positively to using coupons, which is not the definition of margin of error.
 d) This choice states that between 79 % and 85 % of the population likely use grocery coupons, which is consistent with the idea that the true population result could be within 3 % of the sample result.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A hypothesis test is set up so that P(rejecting H0  when H0  is true) = 0.05  and P(failing to reject H0  when H0  is false) = 0.26.  What is the power of the test?  Choices: a) 0.26  b) 0.05  c) 0.95  d) 0.74  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what the power of a test is.  The power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (H0) when it is false.

Given: P(rejecting H0 when H0 is true) = 0.05, which is the significance level (alpha).
P(failing to reject H0 when H0 is false) = 0.26, which is the type II error rate (beta).

The power of the test is the complement of the type II error rate, which is 1 - beta.

So, the power of the test is 1 - 0.26 = 0.74.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: For a class project,  Charlotte recorded the heights of all 28  students in her class and calculated several statistics.  She then realized she made an error recording the height of the tallest person in the class.  She correctly had him listed as the tallest,  but needed to add two inches to his recorded height to correct it.  Which of these measures of spread must remain unchanged?  Choices: a) Mean absolute deviation b) Standard deviation c) Variance d) Interquartile range 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider what happens to each measure of spread when we correct the height of the tallest person by adding two inches.
 a) Mean absolute deviation: This measure is affected by the change in the tallest person's height, as it considers the absolute differences between each height and the mean. So, the mean absolute deviation will change.
 b) Standard deviation: This measure is also affected by the change in the tallest person's height, as it considers the squared differences between each height and the mean. So, the standard deviation will change.
 c) Variance: This measure is affected by the change in the tallest person's height, as it considers the squared differences between each height and the mean. So, the variance will change.
 d) Interquartile range: This measure is not affected by the change in the tallest person's height, as it only considers the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile). So, the interquartile range will remain unchanged.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The main purpose of blocking in an experiment is to: Choices: a) reduce bias.  b) reduce confounding.  c) reduce variation within treatments.  d) reduce variation between treatments.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the purpose of blocking in an experiment.  Blocking is a technique used to reduce variability in an experiment.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given and their effects on the variability in an experiment.  Reducing bias would not necessarily reduce variability within treatments.  Reducing confounding would not necessarily reduce variability between treatments.
 The purpose of blocking is to create groups (blocks) of experimental units that are as similar as possible to each other but different from other blocks.  This helps to reduce variation within treatments.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A manufacturer of motor oil is interested in testing the effects of a newly developed additive on the lifespan of an engine.  Twenty-five different engine types are selected at random and each one is tested using oil with the additive and oil without the additive.  What type of analysis will yield the most useful information?  Choices: a) Matched pairs comparison of population proportions b) Matched pairs comparison of population means c) Independent samples comparison of population proportions d) Independent samples comparison of population means 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the nature of the data being collected.  The data is quantitative,  as the lifespan of an engine is measured in a numerical value.
 Next,  I need to consider the type of comparison being made.  The comparison is between engines that use oil with the additive and engines that use oil without the additive,  so the comparison is between two related groups.
 Finally,  I need to consider the appropriate statistical analysis for this type of comparison and data.  A matched pairs comparison of population means is the most appropriate analysis,  as it compares two related groups and deals with quantitative data.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: To determine the average cost of running for a congressional seat,  a simple random sample of 50  politicians is chosen and the politicians' records examined.  The cost figures show a mean of $125,000  with a standard deviation of $32,000.  Which of the following is the best interpretation of a 90 % confidence interval estimate for the average cost of running for office?  Choices: a) 90 % of politicians running for a congressional seat spend between $117,500  and $132,500.  b) 90 % of politicians running for a congressional seat spend a mean dollar amount that is between $117,500  and $132,500.  c) We are 90 % confident that politicians running for a congressional seat spend between $117,500  and $132,500.  d) We are 90 % confident that politicians running for a congressional seat spend a mean dollar amount between $117,500  and $132,500.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a 90 % confidence interval is.  A 90 % confidence interval means that if we were to repeat the sampling process many times,  90 % of the intervals constructed would contain the true population mean.
 Next,  I need to consider the given information.  We have a sample mean of $125,000  and a standard deviation of $32,000.  The sample size is 50.
 Now,  I need to calculate the confidence interval.  The formula for a confidence interval is: sample mean ± (critical value * standard error).  For a 90 % confidence interval,  the critical value is approximately 1.645.  The standard error is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size: $32,000  ÷ √50  ≈ $4,527.
 The confidence interval is then $125,000  ± (1.645 * $4,527),  which gives us a range of approximately $117,500  to $132,500.
 Therefore,  the best interpretation of the 90 % confidence interval is that we are 90 % confident that the true average cost of running for office is between $117,500  and $132,50{'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A filling machine puts an average of four ounces of coffee in jars,  with a standard deviation of 0.25  ounces.  Forty jars filled by this machine are selected at random.  What is the probability that the mean amount per jar filled in the sampled jars is less than 3.9  ounces?  Choices: a) 0.0057  b) 0.0225  c) 0.025  d) 0.05  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the z-score for the sample mean.  The z-score is calculated as (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n),  where x̄ is the sample mean,  μ is the population mean,  σ is the population standard deviation,  and n is the sample size.
 In this case,  x̄ = 3.9,  μ = 4,  σ = 0.25,  and n = 40.
 Plugging in the values,  I get z = (3.9 - 4) / (0.25 / √40) = -1.79.
 Next,  I need to find the probability that the z-score is less than -1.79.  I can use a z-table or a calculator to find this probability.
 Using a z-table,  I find that the probability is approximately 0.0367.

"Input: A town has one high school,  which buses students from urban,  suburban,  and rural communities.  Which of the following samples is recommended in studying attitudes toward tracking of students in honors,  regular,  and below-grade classes?  Choices: a) Convenience sample b) Simple random sample (SRS) c) Stratified sample d) Systematic sample 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the different types of communities the high school buses students from: urban,  suburban,  and rural.  This indicates that there are distinct groups or strata within the population.
 Next,  I need to consider the different classes the students are in: honors,  regular,  and below-grade.  This indicates that there are different categories of interest within the population.
 To ensure a representative sample,  I should consider using a sampling method that takes into account both the different communities and the different classes.
 The recommended sample in this case is a stratified sample,  as it allows for separate random sampling from each stratum (community type and class type) to ensure representation from all groups.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: A shipment of resistors have an average resistance of 200  ohms with a standard deviation of 5  ohms,  and the resistances are normally distributed.  Suppose a randomly chosen resistor has a resistance under 194  ohms.  What is the probability that its resistance is greater than 188  ohms?  Choices: a) 0.07  b) 0.12  c) 0.50  d) 0.93  
 Output:
 First,  we need to find the probability that a resistor has a resistance under 194  ohms.  To do this,  we can use the z-score formula: z = (X - μ) / σ, where X is the value we're interested in (194  ohms), μ is the mean (200  ohms), and σ is the standard deviation (5  ohms).
 So,  z = (194 - 200) / 5 = -1.2.
 Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator,  we find that the probability of a z-score being less than -1.2 is approximately 0.1151,  or 11.51%.
 Next,  we need to find the probability that a resistor has a resistance greater than 188  ohms.  Again,  we use the z-score formula: z = (X - μ) / σ, where X is 188  ohms.
 So,  z = (188 - 200) / 5 = -2.4.
 Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator,  we find that the probability of a z-score being less than -2.4 is approximately 0.0082,  or 0.82%.
 To find the probability that a resistor has a resistance greater than 188  ohms given that it has a resistance under 194  ohms,  we subtract the probability of being under 194  ohms from the probability of being under 188  ohms: 0.0082 - 0.1151 = -0.1069.
 However,  this result is negative,  which doesn't make sense in the context of probabilities.  We made a mistake in our calculation.  We should have subtracted the probabilities in the opposite order: 0.1151 - 0.0082 = 0.1069.
 Therefore,  the probability that a resistor has a resistance greater than 188  ohms given that it has a resistance under 194  ohms is approximately 0.1069,  or 10.69%.

"Input: A major polling organization wants to predict the outcome of an upcoming national election (in terms of the proportion of voters who will vote for each candidate).  They intend to use a 95 % confidence interval with margin of error of no more than 2.5 %.  What is the minimum sample size needed to accomplish this goal?  Choices: a) 1536  b) 39  c) 1537  d) 40  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the formula for calculating the sample size needed for a confidence interval.  The formula is n = (Z^2 * p * (1-p)) / E^2, where n is the sample size, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (1.96 for 95 % confidence), p is the estimated proportion of the population that has a certain characteristic (I'll assume 0.5 since it gives the largest sample size), and E is the margin of error (0.025 for 2.5 %).
 Next,  I'll plug in the values into the formula: n = (1.96^2 * 0.5 * (1-0.5)) / 0.025^2.
 Now,  I'll perform the calculations: n = (3.8416 * 0.5 * 0.5) / 0.000625.
 Continuing the calculations: n = (1.9208 * 0.5) / 0.000625.
 Further calculations: n = 0.9604 / 0.000625.
 Finally,  I get the sample size: n = 1536.64.
 Since the sample size must be a whole number, I round up to the nearest integer: n = 1537.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Given that the sample has a standard deviation of zero,  which of the following is a true statement?  Choices: a) The standard deviation of the population is also zero.  b) The sample mean and sample median are equal.  c) The sample may have outliers.  d) The population has a symmetric distribution.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the given information.  The sample has a standard deviation of zero,  which means that all the values in the sample are the same.
 Next,  I will analyze each choice.
 a) The standard deviation of the population is also zero.  Since the sample has a standard deviation of zero,  all the values in the population are also the same,  so the standard deviation of the population is zero.
 b) The sample mean and sample median are equal.  Since all the values in the sample are the same,  both the mean and the median will be the same value.
 c) The sample may have outliers.  Since all the values in the sample are the same,  there are no outliers.
 d) The population has a symmetric distribution.  A symmetric distribution with a standard deviation of zero would mean that all values are the same,  but we don't have enough information to determine the shape of the population distribution.

"Input: The number of customers served per day by a large department store is normally distributed,  with a mean of 3,250  customers and a standard deviation of 320.  Find the range of customers served on the middle 50  percent of days.  Choices: a) (3,034,  3,466 ) b) (2,930,  3,570 ) c) (2,610,  3,890 ) d) (2,450,  4,050 ) 
 Output:
 First,  we need to find the range of customers served on the middle 50  percent of days.  Since the distribution is normal,  the middle 50  percent corresponds to the interquartile range (IQR).
 The IQR is the difference between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).  In a normal distribution,  Q1 is 0.6745 standard deviations below the mean,  and Q3 is 0.6745 standard deviations above the mean.
 To find Q1,  we subtract 0.6745 times the standard deviation from the mean: 3,250 - 0.6745 * {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Suppose that 54 % of the graduates from your high school go on to 4 -year colleges,  20 % go on to 2 -year colleges,  19 % find employment,  and the remaining 7 % search for a job.  If a randomly selected student is not going on to a 2 -year college,  what is the probability she will be going on to a 4 -year college?  Choices: a) 0.460  b) 0.540  c) 0.630  d) 0.675  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the probability of a student not going to a 2 -year college.  Since 20 % of the graduates go to 2 -year colleges,  the probability of not going to a 2 -year college is 100 % - 20 % = 80 %.
 Next,  I need to find the probability of a student going to a 4 -year college given that she is not going to a 2 -year college.  Since 54 % of the graduates go to 4 -year colleges,  this is the relevant probability for this condition.
 Therefore,  the probability that a student will be going on to a 4 -year college given that she is not going to a 2 -year college is 54 % or 0.540.

"Input: The Department of Health plans to test the lead level in a specific park.  Because a high lead level is harmful to children,  the park will be closed if the lead level exceeds the allowed limit.  The department randomly selects several locations in the park,  gets soil samples from those locations,  and tests the samples for their lead levels.  Which of the following decisions would result from the type I error?  Choices: a) Closing the park when the lead levels are within the allowed limit b) Keeping the park open when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit c) Closing the park when the lead levels are in excess of the allowed limit d) Keeping the park open when the lead levels are within the allowed limit 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the concept of a type I error in hypothesis testing.  A type I error occurs when we incorrectly reject the null hypothesis,  which,  in this context,  would mean concluding that the lead levels exceed the allowed limit when they actually do not.
 Next,  I need to relate this to the decision-making process regarding the park.  If a type I error occurs,  it means the park is closed due to high lead levels,  but in reality,  the lead levels are within the allowed limit.

"Input: For a class project,  a student wants to see if boys and girls at their large high school differ in the number of contacts they have stored in their phone.  The student conducts a survey of 50  randomly sampled boys and 40  randomly selected girls,  and asks them to report the number of contacts.  Which of the following is true about this situation?  Choices: a) Because the population standard deviations are not known and conditions are met,  the student shoulduse a two-sample t-test.  b) Because the sample sizes are different,  the student should notuse a two-sample t-test.  c) Because the sample sizes are both greater than 30,  the student should notuse a two-sample t-test.  d) Because the shape of the population distribution is not known,  the student should notuse a two-sample t-test.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the conditions for using a two-sample t-test.  The two main conditions are that the samples are independent and that the population standard deviations are not known.  Both of these conditions are met in this situation,  so option a) is true.
 Next,  I need to consider the sample sizes.  The fact that the sample sizes are different does not necessarily mean that the student should notuse a two-sample t-test.  The two-sample t-test can handle different sample sizes.  So,  option b) is not necessarily true.
 Similarly,  the fact that the sample sizes are both greater than 30 does not mean that the student should notuse a two-sample t-test.  The two-sample t-test does not require the sample sizes to be greater than 30.  So,  option c) is not necessarily true.
 Finally,  the shape of the population distribution is not a condition for using a two-sample t-test.  The two-sample t-test assumes that the population distributions are approximately normal,  but this condition is not always required.  So,  option d) is not necessarily true.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: The probability is 0.2  that a value selected at random from a normal distribution with mean 600  and standard deviation 15  will be above what number?  Choices: a) 0.84  b) 603.8  c) 612.6  d) 587.4  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the z-score corresponding to a probability of 0.2.  Since the probability is 0.2 that the value is above a certain number,  the probability that the value is below that number is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.
 Next,  I look up the z-score for a probability of 0.8 in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator.  The z-score is approximately 0.84.
 Now,  I can use the z-score formula to find the value that corresponds to a z-score of 0.84: z = (X - μ) / σ, where X is the value we're looking for, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.
 Rearranging the formula to solve for X, I get X = μ + z * σ.
 Plugging in the values, X = 600 + 0.84 * 15 = 600 + 12.6 = 612.6.

"Input: In a group of 10  scores,  the largest score is increased by 40  points.  What will happen to the mean?  Choices: a) It will remain the same.  b) It will increase by 4  points.  c) It will increase by 10  points.  d) It will increase by 40  points.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand that the mean is the average of the scores.  Increasing the largest score by 40  points will affect the sum of the scores.
 Next,  I need to consider the effect on the sum of the scores.  Since the largest score is increased by 40  points,  the sum of the scores will also increase by 40  points.
 Now,  I need to consider the effect on the mean.  The mean is calculated by dividing the sum of the scores by the number of scores.  In this case,  there are 10  scores.
 To find the effect on the mean,  I divide the increase in the sum of the scores (40  points) by the number of scores (10).  So,  40  ÷ 10  = 4  points.

The t-confidence interval is not appropriate in this situation because Choices: a) the sample size is too small compared to the number of employees in the system to give a fair representation b) the skewed salary distribution tells us that assumption of normality of the sampled population will not be satisfied c) the population standard deviation of the salaries of employees of this county school system is not known d) the teacher salaries are not negotiable,  but the superintendent’s salary is negotiable,  so the superintendent’s salary should be excluded from the population sampled 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the given information.  The distribution of salaries is right skewed,  with the superintendent's salary as an outlier.  A random sample of 20  employees was taken,  and a 95  percent t-confidence interval for the mean salary was calculated.
 Now,  I need to evaluate the choices given.
 a) The sample size is small compared to the number of employees,  but the t-confidence interval can still be used if the sample is representative.  So,  this choice is not the best reason.
 b) The skewed distribution tells us that the assumption of normality is not satisfied,  which is a requirement for using the t-confidence interval.  This is a valid reason.
 c) The population standard deviation is not known,  but the t-confidence interval does not require it.  So,  this choice is not the best reason.
 d) The superintendent's salary is an outlier,  but it does not necessarily mean it should be excluded from the population.  So,  this choice is not the best reason.

 Output:
 First,  I need to find the z-score corresponding to the 25 th percentile.  Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator,  I find that the z-score is approximately -0.67.
 Next,  I need to use the z-score formula to find the mass of the egg that corresponds to this z-score.  The formula is z = (x - μ) / σ, where x is the mass of the egg, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.
 Rearranging the formula to solve for x, I get x = μ + z * σ.
 Plugging in the values,  I have x = 45  + (-0.67) * 4  = 45  - 2.68  = 42.32  g.
 The mass of the egg that would be the 25 th percentile is approximately 42.32  g.

Choices: a) There is a 3.2 % percent chance that the proportion of all Americans who approve of the job the president is doing is not 43 %.  b) There is a 95 % chance that the proportion of all Americans who approve of the job the president is doing is 43 %.  c) About 95 % of polls conducted in this way will find that between 39.8 % and 46.2 % of those sampled approve of the job the president is doing.  d) About 95 % of polls conducted in this way will give a sample proportion within 3.2  percentage points of the actual proportion of all Americans who approve of the job the president is doing.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what the margin of error means in the context of this poll.  The margin of error is ±3.2 %,  which means that the true proportion of all Americans who approve of the job the president is doing is likely to be within 3.2 % points of the sample proportion (43 %),  with a 95 % level of confidence.
 Now,  I need to evaluate each choice based on this understanding.
 a) This choice suggests that there is a 3.2 % chance that the proportion is not 43 %,  which is not what the margin of error indicates.
 b) This choice suggests that there is a 95 % chance that the proportion is 43 %,  which is not what the margin of error indicates.
 c) This choice talks about 95 % of polls,  which is not what the margin of error is about.
 d) This choice states that about 95 % of polls conducted in this way will give a sample proportion within 3.2  percentage points of the actual proportion of all Americans who approve of the job the president is doing,  which is consistent with the margin of error.

"Input: What is the probability of a Type II error when a hypothesis test is being conducted at the 10 % significance level (α = 0.10 )?  Choices: a) 0.05  b) 0.10  c) 0.90  d) There is insufficient information to answer this question.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand that the probability of a Type II error (β) is the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.
 In a hypothesis test,  the significance level (α) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.
 The relationship between α and β is such that α + β = 1,  because these are the only two possible outcomes of a hypothesis test.
 Given that the significance level is 10 % (α = 0.10 ),  I can calculate β by subtracting α from 1: 1 - 0.10 = 0.90.
 Therefore,  the probability of a Type II error is 0.90,  which corresponds to choice c) 0.90.

Choices: a) The mean life expectancy of one model is twice that of the other.  b) The mean life expectancy of one model is 6  years,  while the mean life expectancy of the other is 12  years.  c) The probability that the life expectancies are different is 0.90.  d) We should be 90 % confident that the difference in life expectancies is between 6  and 12  years.  
 Output:
 First,  let's understand the given information.  The 90 % confidence interval for the difference in life expectancies between the two models is (6,  12 ).  This means that if we were to repeat the sampling process many times,  90 % of the time the true difference in life expectancies would fall within this range.
 Now,  let's examine the choices:
 a) The mean life expectancy of one model is twice that of the other.  This statement is not supported by the given confidence interval,  as it does not imply a specific ratio between the two means.
 b) The mean life expectancy of one model is 6  years,  while the mean life expectancy of the other is 12  years.  This statement is not supported by the given confidence interval,  as it suggests specific values for the means,  which are not provided.
 c) The probability that the life expectancies are different is 0.90.  This statement is not supported by the given confidence interval,  as it refers to the probability of the life expectancies being different,  not the difference itself.
 d) We should be 90 % confident that the difference in life expectancies is between 6  and 12  years.  This statement is supported by the given confidence interval,  as it correctly interprets the confidence level as the percentage of times the true difference would fall within the given range.

"Input: A medicine is known to produce side effects in one in five patients taking it.  Suppose a doctor prescribes the medicine to four unrelated patients.  What is the probability that none of the patients will develop side effects?  Choices: a) 0.8  b) 0.4096  c) 0.25  d) 0.2  
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine the probability of a patient not developing side effects.  Since the medicine produces side effects in one in five patients,  the probability of not developing side effects is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5 = 0.8.
 Next,  I need to calculate the probability that all four patients do not develop side effects.  Since the patients are unrelated,  the events are independent.  To find the probability of all independent events occurring,  I multiply the probabilities together: 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.4096.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: Which of the following is notan advantage of stratified random sampling over simple random sampling?  Choices: a) When done correctly,  a stratified random sample is less biased than a simple random sample.  b) When done correctly,  a stratified random sampling process has less variability from sample to sample than a simple random sample.  c) When done correctly,  a stratified random sample can provide,  with a smaller sample size,  an estimate that is just as reliable as that of a simple random sample with a larger sample size.  d) A stratified random sample provides information about each stratum in the population as well as an estimate for the population as a whole,  and a simple random sample does not.  
 Output:
 First,  let's consider the advantages of stratified random sampling over simple random sampling.  Stratified random sampling involves dividing the population into homogeneous subgroups (strata) and then selecting a random sample from each stratum.  This method can lead to a less biased sample because it ensures representation from each stratum.

Next,  stratified random sampling can have less variability from sample to sample because the samples are drawn from well-defined groups within the population,  which reduces the chances of sampling error.

Furthermore,  with a smaller sample size,  a stratified random sample can provide an estimate that is just as reliable as that of a simple random sample with a larger sample size because it targets specific groups within the population.

Finally,  a stratified random sample provides information about each stratum in the population as well as an estimate for the population as a whole,  whereas a simple random sample does not.

Now,  let's look at the choices and identify the one that is not an advantage of stratified random sampling over simple random sampling.  The choice that does not fit the advantages listed is:

"Input: In the casino game of roulette,  there are 38  slots for a ball to drop into when it is rolled around the rim of a revolving wheel: 18  red,  18  black,  and 2  green.  What is the probability that the first time a ball drops into the red slot is on the 8 th trial (in other words,  suppose you are betting on red every time-what is the probability of losing 7  straight times before you win the first time)?  Choices: a) 0.0278  b) 0.0112  c) 0.0053  d) 0.0101  
 Output:
 First,  I need to calculate the probability of losing 7  straight times.  Since there are 18  red slots and 38  total slots,  the probability of losing (i.e.,  not landing on red) is 20/38,  since there are 20 non-red slots.
 The probability of losing 7  straight times is (20/38)^7,  since each trial is independent.
 Next,  I need to calculate the probability of winning on the 8 th trial.  Since the trials are independent,  the probability of winning on the 8 th trial is the same as the probability of landing on red,  which is 18/38.
 To find the overall probability of losing 7  straight times before winning on the 8 th trial,  I multiply the probability of losing 7  straight times by the probability of winning on the 8 th trial: (20/38)^7 * (18/38).
 Calculating this,  I get approximately 0.0112.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A talk show host recently reported that in response to his on-air question,  82 % of the more than 2500  e-mail messages received through his publicized address supported the death penalty for anyone convicted of selling drugs to children.  What does this show?  Choices: a) The survey is meaningless because of voluntary response bias.  b) No meaningful conclusion is possible without knowing something more about the characteristics of his listeners.  c) The survey would have been more meaningful if he had picked a random sample of the 2500  listeners who responded.  d) The survey would have been more meaningful if he had used a control group.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider what type of survey this is.  The talk show host is asking for responses from his audience,  which means the responses are voluntary.  Voluntary response samples can be biased because people with strong opinions are more likely to respond.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  Choice a) is talking about voluntary response bias,  which is a concern in this case.  Choice b) is suggesting that more information about the listeners is needed,  which could be relevant but is not directly related to the voluntary response bias issue.  Choice c) is suggesting that a random sample would have been more meaningful,  which is a valid point but not directly related to the voluntary response bias issue.  Choice d) is suggesting that a control group would have been more meaningful,  which is a valid point but not directly related to the voluntary response bias issue.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: To determine the average number of children living in single-family homes,  a researcher picks a simple random sample of 50  such homes.  However,  even after one follow-up visit the interviewer is unable to make contact with anyone in 8  of these homes.  Concerned about nonresponse bias,  the researcher picks another simple random sample and instructs the interviewer to keep trying until contact is made with someone in a total of 50  homes.  The average number of children is determined to be 1.73.  Is this estimate probably too low or too high?  Choices: a) Too low,  because of undercoverage bias.  b) Too low,  because convenience samples overestimate average results.  c) Too high,  because of undercoverage bias.  d) Too high,  because convenience samples overestimate average results.  
 Output:
 First,  we need to consider the issue of nonresponse bias.  In this case,  the researcher had to make multiple attempts to contact people in some of the homes,  which suggests that the sample is not representative of the population of single-family homes.  The homes that were initially unreachable may have different characteristics,  especially regarding the number of children,  than the homes that were eventually reached.

Next,  we need to consider the type of sample used.  The researcher used a simple random sample for the initial sample of 50  homes,  but then had to make multiple attempts to reach people in some of these homes.  This is not a convenience sample,  as the homes were still selected randomly from the population of single-family homes.

Now,  we need to consider the potential bias.  Since the researcher had to make multiple attempts to reach people in some of the homes,  it is possible that the homes that were eventually reached had a lower average number of children than the homes that were initially unreachable.  This could lead to a nonresponse bias,  where the estimate is too low because the sample is not representative of the entire population.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: If all the values of a data set are the same,  all of the following must equal zero except for which one?  Choices: a) Mean b) Standard deviation c) Variance d) Range 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the properties of a data set where all values are the same.  This means the data set has no variation.
 Next,  I will analyze each of the choices:
 a) Mean: The mean is the average of the data set.  Since all values are the same, the mean will be equal to any of the values in the data set.  Therefore,  the mean is not zero.
 b) Standard deviation: The standard deviation measures the amount of variation in the data set.  Since there is no variation, the standard deviation is zero.
 c) Variance: The variance is the square of the standard deviation.  Since the standard deviation is zero, the variance is also zero.
 d) Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the data set.  Since all values are the same, the range is zero.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A university sent out a survey to a random sample of 120  recent graduates to see how those graduates feel about the education they received.  Thirty-two of the graduates did not respond to the survey.  Which of these would be the best way to proceed?  Choices: a) Use the 88  who did respond,  using 88  as the sample size in the analysis.  b) Use the 88  who did respond,  using 120  as the sample size in the analysis.  c) Attempt to contact the 32  who did not respond and get the information from them.  d) Select 32  more graduates at random and use them to replace the nonresponders.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the goal of the survey.  The university wants to know how recent graduates feel about their education.
 Next,  I need to consider the response rate.  Out of 120  survey recipients,  32  did not respond,  leaving 88  respondents.
 Now,  I need to consider the best way to proceed.  Option a) uses the 88  respondents as the sample size,  but this may not accurately represent the entire group of recent graduates.
 Option b) uses the 88  respondents,  but also counts the 32  nonresponders as part of the sample size,  which is not accurate.
 Option c) attempts to contact the nonresponders,  but this may not be feasible or practical.
 Option d) selects additional graduates at random to replace the nonresponders,  which can help ensure the sample is representative.
 Therefore,  the best way to proceed is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: Given the probabilities P(A) = 0.3  and P(B) = 0.2,  what is the probability of the union P(A ∪ B) if A and B are mutually exclusive?  If A and B are independent?  If B is a subset of A?  Choices: a) 0.44,  0.5,  0.2  b) .44,  0.5,  0.3  c) .5,  0.44,  0.2  d) .5,  0.44,  0.3  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the different scenarios.  If A and B are mutually exclusive,  they cannot occur at the same time, so P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B).
 If A and B are independent,  the occurrence of one does not affect the other, so P(A Ç B) = P(A) * P(B) and P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A Ç B).
 If B is a subset of A,  B is completely contained within A, so P(A ∪ B) = P(A).
 Now,  I will calculate the probabilities for each scenario.
 For mutually exclusive A and B, P(A ∪ B) = 0.3  + 0.2  = 0.5.
 For independent A and B, P(A Ç B) = 0.3  * 0.2  = 0.06 and P(A ∪ B) = 0.3  + 0.2  - 0.06  = 0.44.
 For B being a subset of A, P(A ∪ B) = 0.3.

"Input: Which of the following is true about any discrete probability distribution of a random variable X?  Choices: a) The expected value of X = np.  b) The sum of all possible values of X is equal to one.  c) The probabilities of all possible values of X must add up to one.  d) The probability distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric.  
 Output:
 First, let's analyze each choice:
 a) The expected value of X = np. This choice seems to be related to the expected value of a binomial distribution, where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of success. However, this is not a general property of any discrete probability distribution.
 b) The sum of all possible values of X is equal to one. This choice is incorrect because the sum of all possible values of X would not make sense, as X represents a random variable that can take on various values, not a single value.
 c) The probabilities of all possible values of X must add up to one. This choice is correct, as it is a fundamental property of any probability distribution: the sum of all probabilities must equal one.
 d) The probability distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric. This choice is incorrect because not all discrete probability distributions are bell-shaped and symmetric; for example, the binomial distribution can have different shapes depending on the values of n and p.

Therefore, the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Which among the following would result in the narrowest confidence interval?  Choices: a) Small sample size and 95 % confidence b) Small sample size and 99 % confidence c) Large sample size and 95 % confidence d) Large sample size and 99 % confidence 
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the effect of the sample size on the width of the confidence interval.  A larger sample size generally leads to a narrower confidence interval,  because it provides a more accurate estimate of the population parameter.
 Next,  I need to consider the effect of the confidence level on the width of the confidence interval.  A higher confidence level results in a wider confidence interval,  because it requires a larger range to capture the true population parameter with the specified level of confidence.
 Comparing the options,  a large sample size will result in a narrower confidence interval than a small sample size.  Additionally,  a 95 % confidence level is narrower than a 99 % confidence level.
 Therefore,  the combination of a large sample size and a 95 % confidence level will result in the narrowest confidence interval.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: The correlation between height in inches and weight in pounds for a particular class is 0.65.  If the heights are converted from inches to centimeters,  what will the correlation be?  (1  in.  = 2.54  cm) Choices: a) -0.65  b) -0.26  c) 0.1  d) 0.65  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand that correlation coefficients are scale-invariant.  This means that if both variables are transformed by the same linear transformation,  the correlation coefficient will remain the same.
 In this case,  the heights are being converted from inches to centimeters,  which is a linear transformation.  Since the transformation is applied to both height variables,  the correlation coefficient will not change.
 Therefore,  the correlation between height in centimeters and weight in pounds will be the same as the correlation between height in inches and weight in pounds.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: The number of days it takes to build a new house has a variance of 386.  A sample of 40  new homes shows an average building time of 83  days.  With what confidence can we assert that the average building time for a new house is between 80  and 90  days?  Choices: a) 15.4 % b) 17.8 % c) 20.0 % d) 82.1 % 
 Output:
 First, we need to calculate the standard deviation from the variance. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, so the standard deviation is √386 ≈ 19.65 days.
 Next, we calculate the margin of error using the formula: margin of error = Z * (standard deviation / √sample size). We need to find the appropriate Z-score for the confidence interval.
 The range of interest is between 80 and 90 days, which is a difference of 10 days. We need to find the Z-score that corresponds to this range.
 The Z-score for the lower bound (80 days) is (80 - 83) / 19.65 ≈ -0.153, and the Z-score for the upper bound (90 days) is (90 - 83) / 19.65 ≈ 0.356.
 The confidence interval is the area under the standard normal distribution between these two Z-scores. Using a Z-table or calculator, we find that the area under the curve between -0.153 and 0.356 is approximately 0.178, or 17.8%.
 Therefore, we can assert with 17.8% confidence that the average building time for a new house is between 80 and 90 days.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: A significance test of the hypothesis H0 : p= 0.3  against the alternative HA: p> 0.3  found a value of = 0.35  for a random sample of size 95.  What is the P-value of this test?  Choices: a) 1.06  b) 0.1446  c) 0.2275  d) 0.8554  
 Output:
 First, we need to calculate the test statistic. Since we are dealing with a hypothesis test for a single proportion, we will use the z-test statistic. The formula for the z-test statistic is:

 z = (p̂ - p0) / sqrt(p0(1-p0)/n)

 where p̂ is the sample proportion, p0 is the hypothesized proportion under H0, and n is the sample size.

 In this case, p̂ = 0.35, p0 = 0.3, and n = 95. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

 z = (0.35 - 0.3) / sqrt(0.3(1-0.3)/95) = 0.509

 Next, we need to find the P-value. Since this is an upper-tailed test (we are testing if p > 0.3), the P-value is the probability of observing a z-score greater than 0.509.

 Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that the area to the left of z = 0.509 is approximately 0.695. Since we want the area to the right, the P-value is 1 - 0.695 = 0.305.

 However, the choices given do not match the calculated P-value. It's possible that there was a rounding error in the calculation or the given choices are incorrect. Based on the provided options, the closest value to our calculated P-value is 0.305, which is closest to option c) 0.2275.

 Therefore, the best answer based on the given choices is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Two events A and B each have a nonzero probability.  If A and B are independent,  which of the following statements is true?  Choices: a) P(A and B) = P(A) · P(B) b) A and B may or may not be mutually exclusive.  c) A and B must be mutually exclusive.  d) P(A| B) = P(B| A) 
 Output:
 First,  I need to recall the definition of independent events.  Two events A and B are independent if the occurrence of A does not affect the probability of B occurring,  and vice versa.
 Next,  I need to consider the relationship between the probabilities of independent events.  For independent events,  the probability of both A and B occurring is the product of their individual probabilities: P(A and B) = P(A) · P(B).
 Now,  I need to consider the relationship between independence and mutual exclusivity.  Mutual exclusivity means that the events cannot occur at the same time,  so P(A and B) = 0.  Independence and mutual exclusivity are not the same; independence allows for the possibility that both events can occur,  while mutual exclusivity does not.
 Finally,  I need to consider the conditional probability of independent events.  For independent events,  the conditional probability of A given B is equal to the probability of A,  and the conditional probability of B given A is equal to the probability of B: P(A| B) = P(A) and P(B| A) = P(B).

"Input: A teacher believes that giving her students a practice quiz every week will motivate them to study harder,  leading to a greater overall understanding of the course material.  She tries this technique for a year,  and everyone in the class achieves a grade of at least C.  Is this an experiment or an observational study?  Choices: a) An experiment,  but with no reasonable conclusion possible about cause and effect b) An experiment,  thus making cause and effect a reasonable conclusion c) An observational study,  because there was no use of a control group d) An observational study,  but a poorly designed one because randomization was not used 
 Output:
 First,  I need to determine if the teacher is manipulating any variables.  In this case,  the teacher is giving her students a practice quiz every week,  which is a manipulation of the study environment.
 Next,  I need to consider if this is an experiment or an observational study.  An experiment involves the manipulation of variables,  while an observational study does not.  Since the teacher is manipulating the variable of giving quizzes,  this is an experiment.
 Now,  I need to consider if cause and effect can be reasonably concluded.  In this case,  it is reasonable to conclude that the quizzes had an effect on the students' grades,  since the teacher intentionally introduced the quizzes to improve their understanding.

 Output:
 First,  let's understand what a P-value is.  A P-value is a measure used in statistical hypothesis testing to quantify the evidence against a null hypothesis.
 Next,  let's consider the definition of a P-value.  The P-value is the probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.

"Input: The financial aid office at a state university conducts a study to determine the total student costs per semester.  All students are charged $4500  for tuition.  The mean cost for books is $350  with a standard deviation of $65.  The mean outlay for room and board is $2800  with a standard deviation of $380.  The mean personal expenditure is $675  with a standard deviation of $125.  Assuming independence among categories,  what is the standard deviation of the total student costs?  Choices: a) $24  b) $91  c) $190  d) $405  
 Output:
 First,  I need to consider that the total student costs consist of tuition,  books,  room and board,  and personal expenditure.  Since the categories are independent,  I can calculate the variance of the total costs by adding the variances of each category.
 The variance of tuition is $4500^2  since it is a fixed cost.
 The variance of books is $350^2  = $122500.
 The variance of room and board is $2800^2  = $7840000.
 The variance of personal expenditure is $675^2  = $455625.
 Now,  I need to add these variances to get the total variance: $4500^2  + $122500  + $7840000  + $455625  = $87945000.
 To find the standard deviation,  I take the square root of the total variance: √$87945000  ≈ $9377.
 However,  the choices provided do not include $9377,  so I need to consider that the question asks for the standard deviation of the total student costs,  not the variance.
 The standard deviation is the square root of the variance,  so the standard deviation of the total student costs is √$87945000  ≈ $9377.

Which statement follows from this correlation?  Choices: a) If you want teachers to be happy with their job,  give them more control over their situation.  b) If you want teachers to take more control over their situation,  make them happier at their jobs.  c) Teachers in the study who were more satisfied with their job were less confident in their ability to control their situation.  d) 9 % of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by the linear model with self-efficacy as a predictor.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the correlation coefficient.  A correlation coefficient of 0.30 indicates a positive but weak relationship between the two variables.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  Choice a) suggests that giving teachers more control over their situation will lead to higher job satisfaction, which aligns with the positive relationship between the two variables.
 Choice b) suggests that making teachers happier at their jobs will lead to more control over their situation, which does not directly follow from the correlation coefficient.
 Choice c) suggests that more satisfied teachers were less confident in their ability to control their situation, which contradicts the positive relationship indicated by the correlation coefficient.
 Choice d) calculates the percentage of variability in job satisfaction explained by self-efficacy, which is not directly stated in the correlation coefficient.

 Output:
 First,  I need to find the expected value of the random variable X + Y.  Since the expected value is a linear operator,  E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y).  Given E(X) = 312 and E(Y) = 307,  E(X + Y) = 312 + 307 = 619.
 Next,  I need to find the variance of the random variable X + Y.  The variance of the sum of two random variables is var(X + Y) = var(X) + var(Y) + 2 * cov(X, Y).  Since the covariance is not given,  I cannot calculate the variance of X + Y.

Choices: a) The sets have identical medians.  b) The sets have identical means.  c) The sets have identical ranges.  d) None of the above are false.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to find the median of each set.  The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order.  For set X,  the middle value is 50,  and for set Y,  the middle value is also 50.  So,  the medians are identical.
 Next,  I need to find the mean of each set.  The mean is the average of the numbers.  For set X,  the mean is (10 + 30 + 45 + 50 + 55 + 70 + 90) ÷ 7 = 360 ÷ 7 ≈ 51.43.  For set Y,  the mean is (10 + 30 + 35 + 50 + 65 + 70 + 90) ÷ 7 = 325 ÷ 7 ≈ 46.43.  So,  the means are not identical.
 Then,  I need to find the range of each set.  The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values.  For set X,  the range is 90 - 10 = 80.  For set Y,  the range is 90 - 10 = 80.  So,  the ranges are identical.

 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the key concepts in each choice.  Sampling error is the difference between the sample statistic and the population parameter due to the fact that a random sample is used.  In a well-designed sample survey,  sampling error can be minimized,  but it is not effectively eliminated.  So,  choice a) is not true.
 In an observational study,  the researcher observes the subjects and measures variables of interest but does not attempt to control the conditions under which the data are collected.  So,  choice b) is not true.
 In an experiment,  the researcher manipulates one or more variables (treatments) to observe the effect on other variables (responses).  The treatments are carefully planned to be different and to result in responses that are as different as possible,  not as similar as possible.  So,  choice c) is not true.

"Input: A researcher is hoping to find a predictive linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables in her study.  Accordingly,  as part of her analysis she plans to generate a 95 % confidence interval for the slope of the regression line for the two variables.  The interval is determined to be (0.45,  0.80 ).  Which of the following is (are) true?  (Assume conditions for inference are met. ) I.  She has good evidence of a linear relationship between the variables.  II.  It is likely that there is a non-zero correlation (r) between the two variables.  III.  It is likely that the true slope of the regression line is 0.  Choices: a) I and II only b) I and III only c) II and III only d) I only 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the meaning of the confidence interval for the slope of the regression line.  The interval (0.45,  0.80) means that we are 95 % confident that the true slope of the regression line lies within this range.
 Next,  I need to consider the implications of this confidence interval for the given statements.
 Statement I:  She has good evidence of a linear relationship between the variables.  This is true because a linear relationship implies a change in the response variable with a change in the explanatory variable,  which is reflected in the non-zero slope of the regression line.  Since the confidence interval does not include zero,  there is evidence of a linear relationship.
 Statement II:  It is likely that there is a non-zero correlation (r) between the two variables.  This is also true because a non-zero correlation implies a linear relationship between the variables.  Since we have evidence of a linear relationship,  it is likely that the correlation is non-zero.
 Statement III:  It is likely that the true slope of the regression line is 0.  This is false because the confidence interval does not include zero.  If the true slope were zero,  the confidence interval would include zero.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: A student organization at a university is interested in estimating the proportion of students in favor of showing movies biweekly instead of monthly.  How many students should be sampled to get a 90  percent confidence interval with a width of at most 0.08?  Choices: a) 27  b) 64  c) 106  d) 423  
 Output:
 First,  we need to determine the margin of error (E),  which is half the width of the confidence interval.  In this case,  E = 0.08  ÷ 2 = 0.04.
 Next,  we need to find the critical value (Z) for a 90  percent confidence level.  The critical value for a 90  percent confidence level is 1.645.
 Now,  we need to consider the proportion of students in favor of showing movies biweekly.  Since we don't have this information,  we'll assume the worst-case scenario,  which is a 50  percent proportion.
 To calculate the sample size (n),  we use the formula: n = (Z^2 * p * (1 - p)) / E^2.  Plugging in the values,  we get: n = (1.645^2 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5)) / 0.04^2 = 422.89.
 Since we can't sample a fraction of a student,  we round up to the nearest whole number,  which is 423.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A correlation of 0.6  indicates that the percentage of variation in y that is explained by the variation in x is how many times the percentage indicated by a correlation of 0.3?  Choices: a) 2  b) 3  c) 4  d) 6  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand that the percentage of variation explained by a correlation coefficient is given by the square of the coefficient.
 So,  for a correlation of 0.6,  the percentage of variation explained is 0.6^2 = 0.36,  or 36%.
 For a correlation of 0.3,  the percentage of variation explained is 0.3^2 = 0.09,  or 9%.
 Now,  I need to find how many times 9% is explained by 36%.  I do this by dividing 36% by 9%: 36 ÷ 9 = 4.
 Therefore,  a correlation of 0.6 explains 4 times the percentage of variation in y that a correlation of 0.3 explains.
 The correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: For which of the following is it appropriate to use a census?  Choices: a) A 95 % confidence interval of mean height of teachers in a small town.  b) A 95 % confidence interval of the proportion of students in a small town who are taking some AP class.  c) A two-tailed hypothesis test where the null hypothesis was that the mean expenditure on entertainment by male students at a high school is the same as that of female students.  d) None of the above.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a census is.  A census is a survey that collects data from all members of a population.
 Next,  I need to consider each choice and determine if a census is appropriate.
 a) A 95 % confidence interval of mean height of teachers in a small town.  A census would be appropriate here because the population is small and manageable.
 b) A 95 % confidence interval of the proportion of students in a small town who are taking some AP class.  A census would be appropriate here because the population is small and manageable.
 c) A two-tail hypothesis test where the null hypothesis was that the mean expenditure on entertainment by male students at a high school is the same as that of female students.  A census would not be appropriate here because the population is large and not manageable.
 d) None of the above.  This choice is not correct because choices a) and b) are appropriate for a census.

Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'a'}"
"Input: Which of the following is the best description of the power of a significance test?  Choices: a) The probability that the null hypothesis is true.  b) The probability of getting a Type I error.  c) The probability of getting a Type II error.  d) The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if it is,  in fact,  false.  
 Output:
 First,  let's understand what a significance test is.  A significance test is a statistical procedure that uses sample data to evaluate the hypothesis that the null hypothesis is true.
 Next,  let's consider the options.  Option a) refers to the probability of the null hypothesis being true,  which is not the purpose of a significance test.
 Option b) refers to the probability of a Type I error,  which is the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.  This is related to the significance level of the test,  but it's not the best description of the power of the test.
 Option c) refers to the probability of a Type II error,  which is the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.  This is related to the power of the test,  but it's not the best description.
 Option d) refers to the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is,  in fact,  false.  This is the definition of the power of a significance test.
 Therefore,  the best description of the power of a significance test is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: A drug company will conduct a randomized controlled study on the effectiveness of a new heart disease medication called Heartaid.  Heartaid is more expensive than the currently used medication.  The analysis will include a significance test with H0 : Heartaid and the current medication are equally effective at preventing heart disease and HA: Heartaid is more effective than the current medication at preventing heart disease.  Which of these would be a potential consequence of a Type II error?  Choices: a) Patients will spend more money on Heartaid,  even though it is actually not any more effective than the current medication.  b) Doctors will begin to prescribe Heartaid to patients,  even though it is actually not any more effective than the current medication.  c) Patients will continue to use the current medication,  even though Heartaid is actually more effective.  d) Researchers will calculate the wrong P-value,  making their advice to doctors invalid.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand what a Type II error is.  A Type II error occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis (H0) when it is actually false.  In this context,  a Type II error would mean that we conclude Heartaid and the current medication are equally effective,  when in reality Heartaid is more effective.
 Now,  I need to consider the potential consequences of this error.  Option a) suggests that patients will spend more money on Heartaid,  even though it is not more effective.  However,  this is not a direct consequence of a Type II error,  as patients would still benefit from the current medication.
 Option b) suggests that doctors will prescribe Heartaid to patients,  even though it is not more effective.  Again,  this is not a direct consequence of a Type II error,  as doctors would still have the option to prescribe the current medication.
 Option c) suggests that patients will continue to use the current medication,  even though Heartaid is actually more effective.  This is a direct consequence of a Type II error,  as we would fail to recognize the superiority of Heartaid and continue to rely on the less effective medication.
 Option d) suggests that researchers will calculate the wrong P-value,  making their advice to doctors invalid.  This is not a direct consequence of a Type II error,  as it refers to a calculation error rather than a failure to reject the null hypothesis.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"
"Input: Two classes take the same exam.  Suppose a certain score is at the 40 th percentile for the first class and at the 80 th percentile for the second class.  Which of the following is the most reasonable conclusion?  Choices: a) Students in the first class generally scored higher than students in the second class.  b) Students in the second class generally scored higher than students in the first class.  c) A score at the 20 th percentile for the first class is at the 40 th percentile for the second class.  d) A score at the 50 th percentile for the first class is at the 90 th percentile for the second class.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the meaning of percentile.  A score at the 40 th percentile means that 40% of the scores in the first class are below that score.  Similarly,  a score at the 80 th percentile in the second class means that 80% of the scores in the the second class are below that score.
 Comparing the two percentiles,  I can see that a score that is at the 40 th percentile in the first class is at the 80 th percentile in the second class.
 This means that the scores in the second class are generally higher than the scores in the first class.
 Therefore,  the most reasonable conclusion is {'sol': 'b'}"
"Input: The mean thrust of a certain model jet engine is 9500  pounds.  Concerned that a production process change might have lowered the thrust,  an inspector tests a sample of units,  calculating a mean of 9350  pounds with a z-score of -2.46  and a P-value of 0.0069.  Which of the following is the most reasonable conclusion?  Choices: a) 99.31 % of the engines produced under the new process will have a thrust under 9350  pounds.  b) 99.31 % of the engines produced under the new process will have a thrust under 9500  pounds.  c) 0.69 % of the time an engine produced under the new process will have a thrust over 9500  pounds.  d) There is evidence to conclude that the new process is producing engines with a mean thrust under 9500  pounds.  
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the given information.  The inspector found a sample mean of 9350  pounds with a z-score of -2.46  and a P-value of 0.0069.  This means that the sample mean is significantly lower than the expected mean thrust of 9500  pounds.
 Next,  I need to interpret the P-value.  The P-value of 0.0069 is less than a common significance level of 0.05,  which means that there is strong evidence against the null hypothesis that the mean thrust is 9500  pounds.
 Now,  I need to consider the options given.  Option d) states that there is evidence to conclude that the new process is producing engines with a mean thrust under 9500  pounds.  This is consistent with the P-value and the z-score.
 Therefore,  the most reasonable conclusion is {'sol': 'd'}"
"Input: When the point (15,2 ) is included,  the slope of regression line (y= a+ bx) is b= -0.54.  The correlation is r= -0.82.  When the point is removed,  the new slope is -1.04  and the new correlation coefficient is -0.95.  What name is given to a point whose removal has this kind of effect on statistical calculations?  Choices: a) Outlier b) Statistically significant point c) Point of discontinuity d) Influential point 
 Output:
 First,  I need to understand the effect of removing the point (15,2 ) on the regression line and correlation coefficient.  Removing the point increases the slope of the regression line and decreases the correlation coefficient,  which indicates that the point has a strong influence on the regression line and correlation.
 Next,  I need to consider the choices given.  An outlier is a data point that is significantly different from other observations,  which could have a strong influence on statistical calculations.  A statistically significant point refers to a point that has a significant effect on the results of a statistical test,  which is not related to the removal of a point from the dataset.  A point of discontinuity refers to a point where a function or data set is not continuous,  which is not related to the removal of a point from the dataset.  An influential point is a data point that has a strong effect on the results of a statistical analysis,  which is consistent with the observed effect of removing the point from the dataset.
 Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'd'}"
