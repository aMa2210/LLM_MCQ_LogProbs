 Output:
 First,  I need to consider the context of the question.  The question mentions ethical concerns for employees and occupational health,  safety,  and environmental regulations.
 Next,  I can eliminate choices that do not fit the context.  Employee privacy and free speech are not directly related to occupational health,  safety,  and environmental regulations.
 This leaves me with two choices: a) Work-life balance and b) Healthy and safe working conditions.

 Next,  I need to compare the choices given to the concept of the enlightened self-interest model of CSR.  Choice a) suggests putting the organization's interests first,  which is not in line with the concept of ethical behavior.  Choice b) suggests considering what a shareholder would want,  which is also not in line with the concept of ethical behavior.

 c) Proximity,  Temporal immediacy,  Social dissensus: These are all factors that can impact the moral intensity.  Proximity can influence how relevant or close an action is to the individual making the moral judgment,  temporal immediacy can affect how urgent or important a moral decision feels,  and social dissensus can influence how people perceive the morality of an action.
 d) Social dissensus,  Cultural immediacy,  Proximity: While social dissensus and proximity can impact moral intensity,  cultural immediacy is not a direct factor.  It is related to the cultural context of a decision,  but not necessarily to the moral intensity itself.

 Output:
 First,  I need to identify the characteristics that tend to characterise small businesses' engagement with business-related issues.  The question provides four options,  so I will analyze each one.
 Option a) mentions size and complexity,  owner and family member influence,  and shareholder and stakeholder power.  Size and complexity can affect how small businesses engage with issues,  but they are not the primary characteristics.  Owner and family member influence is a common characteristic of small businesses,  and shareholder and stakeholder power can also play a role.
 Option b) mentions lack of organisational resources,  size and complexity,  and owner and family member influence.  Lack of resources is a common issue for small businesses,  but size and complexity are not the primary characteristics of their engagement.
 Option c) mentions informal relationships,  owner and family member influence,  and lack of organisational resources.  Informal relationships and lack of resources are common characteristics of small businesses,  and owner and family member influence is also a key factor.
 Option d) mentions bureaucratic and formal organisational structure,  lack of organisitional resources,  and conflicts of interest.  Bureaucratic and formal structures are not typical of small businesses,  and conflicts of interest are not a primary characteristic of their engagement.

Based on the analysis,  the characteristic that best describes small businesses' engagement with business-related issues is owner and family member influence on the organisation.  Therefore,  the correct answer is {'sol': 'c'}"

 a) This statement claims that business ethics is not a real concept,  which contradicts the definition of business ethics as the study of moral principles and values in business.
 b) This statement accurately describes business ethics as the study of business situations,  activities,  and decisions where issues of right and wrong are addressed.
 c) This statement claims that business ethics is an oxymoronic term,  which means it is a combination of two contradictory terms.  However,  business ethics is not inherently contradictory; it is the study of moral principles and values in business.
 d) This statement focuses on the profitability of business activities,  which is not the main concern of business ethics.  Business ethics is concerned with moral principles and values, not just profitability.

Based on the evaluation,  the correct statement is {'sol': 'b'}"
